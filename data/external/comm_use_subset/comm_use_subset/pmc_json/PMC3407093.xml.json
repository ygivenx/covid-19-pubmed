However, their contributions to neuroprotection and regulation by inflammatory mediators are not well defined. CNS insults, including autoimmune disease, initiate rapid astrocyte activation characterized by cellular hypertrophy and increased intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression [3]\u2013[5]. Astrocytes form a physical barrier surrounding areas of inflammation initially limiting bystander tissue damage [6], [7]. However, this barrier subsequently impedes axonal regeneration contributing to sustained disability [3], [5], [8]. Innate and adaptive pro-inflammatory astrocyte functions include production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases [3]\u2013[5]. By contrast, secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and scavengers of reactive oxygen species, as well as inhibition of both microglial activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion, all support an astrocyte mediated anti-inflammatory function [3]\u2013[5]. Therefore, astrocyte activation constitutes a ubiquitous, yet heterogeneous response associated with both promoting and inhibiting CNS repair [3]\u2013[5].",

            "text": "MS and EAE are both associated with T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 (Th1 cells) and IL-17 (Th17 cells) which play complex, not fully understood roles in disease initiation and progression [2], [9]. In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that suppression of encephalitogenic T cell proliferation within the CNS during EAE and activation of anti-inflammatory programs are in part mediated via astrocytes [4], [5]. Similar to astrocytes, IFN-\u03b3 mediates both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions during autoimmune disease [10]. Early IFN-\u03b3 induced effects are pro-inflammatory; IFN-\u03b3 facilitates inflammatory cell access, shapes their composition, increases major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, contributes to macrophage and microglia activation, and initiates oligodendrocyte death [11]. Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 mediated protection during EAE is also multifaceted [12]\u2013[15]. It acts as a negative regulator of neutrophil accumulation, Th17 cell activation, IL-1R signaling, protease secretion, and chemokine activity. It also inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion via induction of suppressor of cytokine secretion (SOCS) proteins, facilitates T cell apoptosis and protects oligodendrocytes via inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses [10], [11], [16], [17]. This highlights the critical role of a single mediator in both promoting disease but also limiting inflammatory mediated damage required to initiate repair cascades. Based on the gatekeeper functions of astrocytes and the diverse biological effects of IFN-\u03b3, we set out to determine how IFN-\u03b3 signaling specifically to astrocytes influences CNS autoimmune disease. The results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes had no profound effects on initial disease progression, but played an essential protective role during the transition from acute to chronic disease. Clinical remission induced by IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes coincided with reduced demyelination, axonal degeneration, and astrocyte activation. The IFN-\u03b3 receptor is expressed ubiquitously; however, these data reveal astrocytes as the primary target and mediator of the well established anti-inflammatory activity of IFN-\u03b3 within the CNS.",

Peripheral activation of self reactive T cells in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice was similar to wt mice (data not shown). This is consistent with both the CNS restricted transgene expression in the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice as well as the similar T cell activation following peripheral immunization with a non-self antigen [18]. Following immunization the incidence of disease, initiation of clinical symptoms, and initial symptom progression were unaltered by the inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 1A; Table 1). In addition, neither immunized group exhibited clinical symptoms of atypical EAE associated with the absence of IFN-\u03b3 [19]. However, clinical symptoms in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice began to diverge from wt mice at \u223c day 12 post immunization (p.i.) prior to the peak of clinical disease. In both groups clinical disease peaked at \u223c day 14 p.i., but severity was increased from a score of 3.1 in wt mice to 4.0 in the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 group (Fig. 1A; Table 1).",

            "text": "GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 and wt mice were compared at the peak of acute disease to determine if IFN-\u03b3 signaling altered astrocyte activation or CNS inflammation. Astrocyte hypertrophy and GFAP expression (Fig. 1B) were similar in both groups, indicating no overt effects of IFN-\u03b3 on initial astrocyte reactivity. Furthermore, neither the extent of inflammation nor the anatomic distribution of inflammatory cells was altered (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry confirmed no difference in the overall extent of CD45hi inflammatory cells recruited into the CNS (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, percentages of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2A), CD8+ T cells and macrophages within the infiltrates were also similar (Fig. 3). In contrast to the association between increased EAE severity and neutrophil accumulation in the global absence of IFN-\u03b3 [14], [15], only a small percentage of neutrophils were identified in the CNS of both groups by flow cytometry (Fig. 3); their low presence was confirmed by the inability to identify cells with the characteristic morphology of neutrophils in the brain by histopathology (Fig. 1B). The absence of increased neutrophils in the CNS of GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice during acute disease suggested that clinical disease was aggravated by a mechanism distinct from global IFN-\u03b3 deficiency. In addition to the similar frequency of CD4+ T cells in the brains of the two groups (Fig. 2A), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) reactive CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were also similar (Fig. 2B). By contrast, MOG specific CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 (Fig. 2B) and Foxp3+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) were decreased in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice compared to wt mice (Fig. 2C). Reduced Th17 and Tregs may be attributed to increased IFN-\u03b3 [10], [16]. Alternatively, as IFN-\u03b3 is protective in EAE [12]\u2013[15], increased disease severity may reflect reduced bioavailable IFN-\u03b3 due to sequestration of IFN-\u03b3 binding to the dominant negative receptor. However, measurement of IFN-\u03b3 in cell free supernatants derived from dissociated brains at the peak of acute disease demonstrated protein levels of 2.1\u00b10.2 ng/brain in wt mice versus 3.6\u00b10.5 ng/brain in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice (n = 3; p<0.05). As overall frequencies of MOG reactive CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were similar, increased IFN-\u03b3 in the brains of GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice suggested enhanced secretion at the cellular level. Although a contribution of NK or CD8 T cells could not be excluded, these potential sources of IFN-\u03b3 were unlikely due to their low frequencies (NK \u223c5% and CD8+ T cells \u223c 5%, see Fig. 3) and their equivalent frequencies in the wt and GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice. Furthermore, reduced Th17 cell and Treg frequencies were consistent with suppression of these populations due to elevated IFN-\u03b3 [10], [16], [20].",

Furthermore, the increase in demyelination was associated with a prominent loss of axons in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice compared to controls (Fig. 4). Despite elevated demyelination and axonal loss in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes, spinal cords showed no evidence of differential astrocyte activation by either immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4), or differences in GFAP mRNA expression during the peak of acute disease (Fig. 5). Although CCL5, IL-1 and TNF mRNA expression were increased in the spinal cords of the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice, no differences in IFN-\u03b3, iNOS, CXCL10 or IL-6 mRNA were consistent with similar inflammation (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the initial disease pathogenesis, reflected by an increased demyelination in spinal cords, but not brain, during ascending paralysis is dampened by IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes.",

Similar to the acute disease, relative percentages of neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were all similar (Fig. 3). Furthermore, no differences in expression of activation markers on CNS derived CD4+ T cells, including CD69, CD122, CD127, Fas, FasL, ICOS and CD152 were evident between the groups (data not shown). The percentages of MOG reactive Th1 cells were also not altered in the CNS of GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 relative to wt mice (Fig. 8B) and the decreased percentage of potentially destructive Th17 cells identified during acute disease (Fig 2), was also sustained during chronic disease (Fig. 8B). Equivalent expression of IL-7, IL-23 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA (Fig. 8C) suggested that the decrease in Th17 cells was dependent upon an increase in IFN-\u03b3 and not related to a defect in activation or maintenance signals [20]. Increased inflammation and sustained MHC class II expression on microglia (Fig. 8A) further suggested that IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes down regulates inflammation universally without altering the composition of the CNS infiltrates. This concept is supported by sustained composition of CNS infiltrates during inflammation induced astrocyte apoptosis [21].",

            "text": "The inability to restrain ongoing inflammation during EAE in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice was evident at multiple levels. Astrocyte activation was sustained consistent with increased expression of GFAP mRNA. CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA levels were increased (Fig. 8C). The expression of mRNA encoding potentially destructive immune mediators including IL-1, IL-6, iNOS, and TNF were all increased (Fig. 8C). IFN-\u03b3 was \u223c2-fold higher in the CNS of GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice (Fig. 9). Lastly, the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was reduced (Fig. 9), suggesting limited availability of IL-10 may be a key in prolonging astrocyte activation and inflammation [22]. A possible link between reduced IL-10 and the inability of IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes is provided by the capacity of IFN-\u03b3 to induce IL-27 in astrocytes [23], thereby promoting IL-10 production. Indeed IL-27 in the CNS of the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice was significantly reduced compared to wt mice during chronic disease (Fig. 9). By contrast, IL-12 (Fig. 9), an indirect suppressor of CNS inflammation by promoting IFN-\u03b3 production [24], was similar in the CNS of both GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 and wt mice. Astrocytes derived from GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 and wt mice were stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 to confirm IFN-\u03b3 dependent IL-27 secretion by astrocytes [25]. While IFN-\u03b3 induced IL-27 secretion by astrocytes from wt mice, IL-27 secretion was significantly reduced in cultures derived from GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice (Fig. 10). These data support the possibility that IFN-\u03b3 mediated IL-27 secretion by astrocytes regulates EAE effector T cell function, inflammation and tissue destruction via induction of IL-10; however, this does not exclude the possibility that the inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN-\u03b3 could directly or indirectly dysregulate a variety of other immunomodulatory functions [4], [5], [17].",

Protection has been attributed to a variety of potentially interrelated mechanisms including limiting neutrophil accumulation, Th17 cell activation, IL-1R signaling, matrix metalloproteinase secretion, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and chemokine activity; in addition IFN-\u03b3 facilitates T cell apoptosis and protects oligodendrocytes from death via an ER stress response [10], [11], [17].

            "text": "Early functions of astrocytes imposed by innate responses are largely pro-inflammatory during EAE [3], [6], [7], [26]. For example, astrocytes contribute to the loss of BBB integrity via secretion of reactive oxygen species, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines [3]\u2013[5]. This pro-inflammatory milieu is associated with initial axonal damage prior to accumulation of self reactive T cells [27], which further promotes immune mediated damage. Blocking the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB in astrocytes improves recovery during chronic EAE [28], [29]. Supporting an initial pro-inflammatory role of astrocytes dependent on innate, not IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness, inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling to astrocytes did not influence EAE onset or incidence, initial disease progression, astrocyte activation, or BBB integrity as indicated by similar entry of inflammatory cells into the brain. By contrast, an inflammation dampening effect of IFN-\u03b3 became evident during the onset of disease remission. Astrocytes limit ongoing inflammation and pathogenic processes at several levels. They not only facilitate repair by inhibiting inflammatory cell entry into the CNS parenchyma [6], [7], [30], but also down regulate T cell effector function and proliferation [4], [5], [21]. For example, EAE in GFAP deficient mice results in more severe and widespread inflammation [31]. In addition, T cell-astrocyte interactions as well as astrocyte secretion of an unidentified soluble product, distinct from nitric oxide, prostaglandins, or tryptophan metabolism, suppress T cell proliferation [4], [5]. T cell proliferation was also not inhibited via defective IL-2 release, despite the suggestion that T cell-astrocyte interactions facilitate secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines [4], [5]. Lastly, astrocytes may limit inflammation by triggering apoptosis in T cells [32]. Nevertheless, the role of IFN-\u03b3 signaling in these potentially anti-inflammatory, protective mechanisms is not clear.",

Indeed, enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production may reflect an attempt to compensate for the loss of IFN-\u03b3 dependent astrocyte mediated control of inflammation [33]. Sustained expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF, thus represents a primary mechanism underlying ongoing tissue destruction in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice. IL-6 is known to mediate neurological dysfunction [34] and astrocytes are the predominant source of IL-6 during CNS autoimmune disease. Furthermore, its secretion is down regulated by IFN-\u03b3 induced SOCS activity [17]. On the other hand, sustained TNF implicated dysregulated activation of microglia or macrophages via increased IFN-\u03b3 or IL-6, as TNF is predominantly secreted by activated CNS macrophages and microglia during EAE [35], [36]. However, the down regulation of microglia activation, including TNF secretion, following interaction with activated astrocytes [37] questions this notion. While both IL-6 and TNF may thus contribute to sustained pathological changes, the source of TNF remains unclear. Similarly, astrocytes are a potential source of the IFN-\u03b3 induced chemokine CXCL10 during EAE, one of the chemokines controlling T cell recruitment [38]. However, the increased expression of CXCL10 coupled with the inability of the astrocytes in the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 mice to respond to IFN-\u03b3 suggests altered microglia activation and secretion of CXCL10 [38] or activation of CXCL10 transcription via an independent signaling pathway mediated by TNF or Type 1 interferons [39], [40].",

Although it is possible that the increased IFN-\u03b3 in the CNS influenced peripheral activation of antigen specific Th17 cells, previous data demonstrated no evidence for expression of the transgene in peripheral organs, including lymphoid organs [18]. IL-10, secreted by a variety of cells types including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Tregs [42], inhibits both acute and chronic EAE [43], [44]. The decrease in this anti-inflammatory cytokine suggests that the induction of IL-27 secretion is a critical aspect of astrocyte responses to IFN-\u03b3, thus promoting IL-10 secretion by T cells [23], [25]. However, our data is unable to distinguish the contribution of paracrine versus autocrine IFN-\u03b3 induced signals to astrocytes on IL-10 production, as IL-10 also regulates astrocyte activation [22], and can itself be secreted by astrocytes to exert autologous functions [45].",

Activated astrocytes, especially within and adjacent to areas of demyelination are a prominent feature of white matter plaques associated with both chronic MS and EAE [3]\u2013[5]. Astrocytes protect neurons and oligodendroglia, but also form glial scars which inhibit regeneration after neuronal injury [3], [5], [8], [20]. The absence of reactive astrocytes increases axonal regeneration after injury [46], consistent with the concept that limiting astrogliosis is critical for axonal regeneration after neuronal injury. While the significance of sustained astrocyte activation in grey matter tracks is unclear in our model, it is consistent with increased axonal damage, and suggests possible damage to axons outside the lesions, which may not be manifested by histological analysis.",

This is critically important within the CNS which has limited regenerative capacity. In summary, our data identify astrocytes as prominent targets underlying IFN-\u03b3 mediated suppression of chronic CNS inflammation [19]. The data further provide a link between sustained inflammatory responses, enhanced demyelination and axonal degeneration associated with loss of neurological function during EAE and chronic progressive MS. Although the inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN-\u03b3 did not alter disease in the brain, engagement of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor on astrocytes in spinal cord limits demyelination and functions in a neuroprotective capacity. Current therapies for MS are primarily focused on anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory approaches and have been partially successful in treating acute episodes. The identification of astrocytes as critical responders and mediators of IFN-\u03b3 signaling in limiting CNS autoimmune disease may provide insights into new approaches to limit long term progression to disability.",
