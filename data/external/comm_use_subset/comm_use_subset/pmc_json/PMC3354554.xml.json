Although the exact therapeutic mechanisms have not been fully established, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the most effective therapy for KD to reduce the prevalence of CAL [2].",

Of them, at least three main mechanisms are suggested to explain the anti-inflammatory function of high dose IVIG: first, high-dose IgG saturates the neonatal FcRs (FcRn) and leads to the increased catabolism of autoantibodies; second, high-dose IgG saturates the activating Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) and prevents autoantibody-mediated activation of leukocytes; third, high-dose IgG increases the cell surface expression of inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptors [4]. A single, N-linked glycosylation site exists at the amino acid 297 in the heavy chain of all IgG subclasses with approximately 10% terminating in sialic acid [5]. Recently, the \u03b12, 6 sialylated IgG was reported to interact with a lectin receptor, specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin homolog-related 1 (SIGN-R1) in mice and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) in humans, and to trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade that promotes the upregulation of inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs on inflammatory macrophages [6].",

However, whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to KD is still unknown. Since DC-SIGN, also known as CD209, is so important for the anti-inflammatory functions of IVIG, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CD209 molecule will be involved in the pathogenesis of KD or response to IVIG treatment. We hypothesized that the SNP rs4804803 of DC-SIGN promoter may be involved in the susceptibility to KD, CAL formation, coronary artery fistula formation, and IVIG treatment response in KD patients. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study involving 278 patients with KD and 243 controls.",

All patients were treated with a single high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) over a 12-hour period [10\u201312]. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital with written consent statement. We excluded patients who did not fit the diagnostic criteria of KD. CAL was defined by the internal diameter of the coronary artery being greater than 3 mm (4 mm, if the subject was over the age of 5 years) or the internal diameter of a segment being at least 1.5 times that of an adjacent segment, as observed in the echocardiogram [13, 14]. KD patients with coronary artery ectasia or dilatation which was disappearing within the initial 6\u20138 weeks after the onset of illness was defined as transient CAL [3]. The diagnosis of coronary artery fistula (CAF) was made mainly by pulsed Doppler and color flow imaging [15]. IVIG treatment responsiveness was defined as defevrscence 48 hrs after the completion of IVIG treatment and no fever (temperature, >38\u00b0C) recurrence for at least 7 days after the initial IVIG treatment with marked improvement of inflammatory signs [16]. Patients with IVIG resistance received another dose of IVIG (1-2 g/kg) or other anti-inflammatory regiments. Children who were admitted for upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections (including acute bronchiolitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, croup, and acute tonsillitis) were also collected as control subjects for comparison during the same study period, as we have previously described [12].",

The primer sequences were 5\u2032-GGACAGTGCTTCCAGGAACT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGTGTTACACCCCCTCCACTAG-3\u2032 (reverse). The TaqMan minor groove binder probe sequences were 5\u2032-TACCTGCCTACCCTTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGCCCACCCTTG-3\u2032. The probes were labeled with the TaqMan fluorescent dyes VIC and FAM, respectively. The PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 \u03bcL using the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for one minute. After the PCR, the genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System, using SDS 1.1 software for allele discrimination (both Applied Biosystems). To validate the genotyping by real-time PCR analysis, 100 PCR products were subject to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MscI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and showed a 100% identical result between these two genotyping systems as noted in our previous report [17].",

The real cause of KD remains unknown. It is generally accepted that KD results from an undefined infectious process trigger in a genetically predisposed individual [25]. A genetic predisposition is suggested based on clinical and epidemiologic features [1, 26]. In this study, we investigated whether the polymorphism of DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter \u2212336 A/G (rs4804803) was associated with susceptibility and CAL formation in KD. Our study showed that the allele \u2212336G was associated with susceptibility to KD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the association between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and susceptibility to KD.",

In addition to its protective role, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was also noted to have anti-inflammatory effects at high doses. Recently, the \u03b12, 6 sialylated IgG was reported to interact with a lectin receptor, SIGN-R1 in mice and DC-SIGN in humans, and to trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade. Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that a functional SNP in the DC-SIGN molecule will be involved in the response to IVIG treatment. However, in our study, we found the variant and haplotype of \u2212336A/G in the DC-SIGN gene did not associate with the occurrence of IVIG resistance or CAL formation in KD. Because of its highly polymorphic nature and numerous SNPs of DC-SIGN gene [27\u201329], further investigation into other candidate SNPs contributing to KD morbidity is needed. Besides dendritic cells, IVIG was observed to affect many other cells, including endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and T and B cells [30\u201332]. The numerous effects of IVIG therapy also partly explain there not being an association of \u2212336A/G SNP of the DC-SIGN gene with IVIG resistance in KD.",

First, the relatively small sample size of this study might prevent some of the detected associations from being statistically significant. Second, our study results need to be validated across different populations. Since the incidence of KD in Asian populations is much greater than among Caucasians [1], the host's genetic background must be considered in the study of KD. In our control group, the frequency of the \u2212336G DC-SIGN gene allele was 3.5%. This result agreed with previous reports showing very low \u2212336G DC-SIGN gene allelic frequency in Asians [33, 34]. The highest \u2212336G allelic frequency was found in African populations (35\u201348%), next in Caucasian populations (20%), and the lowest was observed in Asians [8, 33].",
