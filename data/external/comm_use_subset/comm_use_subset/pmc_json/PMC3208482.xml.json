            "text": "Until recently, studies examining sequence variations within human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis. With the development of the high-throughput sequencing of PCR products, which is highly sensitive, specific and relatively low cost, it has become more common in the medical and forensic fields to sequence the whole mitochondrial genome [1]. As a result, more rapid sequencing using microarrays-based resequencing is being used increasingly in clinical and research laboratories for identifying mutations throughout the entire mtDNA genome. Resequencing microarrays are a promising technology for diagnostic mitochondrial disorders and related diseases based on changes at the genetics level [2-5]. However, validation of output data particularly for mtDNA, i.e., the accuracy of base identification (or call) for homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations, as well as detection insertions or deletions (indels) from these microarrays-based resequencing chips has been a major issue [2,6,7].",

Each mitochondrial gene of interest is represented by sets of oligonucleotide probes with a matching sequence as reported in MITOMAP: A Human Mitochondrial Genome Database, http://www.mitomap.org[3,4,6]. The MitoChip v2.0 software (GSEQ) assigns a base call at any given position by using the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry codes (IUPAC codes), and then compares the base call to the Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS). A base call will be assigned either as a wildtype (WT), homoplasmic sequence variant (the presence of a point mutation within all of the mtDNA copies), heteroplasmic sequence variant (the presence of a mixture of more than one type of mtDNA copies some are wildtype and some with point mutation or both copies are point mutations, i.e., both differing from rCRS), or N-call [8].",

In three independent studies, it was concluded that despite improvements in call rate and accuracy achieved by adjusting the GSEQ software parameters, the call rates remain less accurate and less sensitive than conventional dye-terminator sequencing. This failure was attributed to poor hybridization at regions with \u22654 sequential C bases and poor probe performance, [9] as well as variability of the individual target sequence [6,10]. The GSEQ software may also return N-calls and even false-positives when poor hybridization resulting from deletion are present in the sample mtDNA [9]. Balanced against these deficits, the MitoChip still provides a high-throughput tool that is fast, easily automated, and cost-effective for targeting regions of mtDNA sequence variation, with reasonable accuracy [8].",

One study used a novel DNA array (Birmingham ReseqUencing Microarray version 1-BRUM1) designed to analyse 92 nuclear DNA genes (involved in metabolic pathways) using specific probes to detect point mutations or known indels, in addition to sequencing. While most deletions (7/10) were not detected, the three samples with homozygous deletions were detected as 'stretches' of N-calls. Furthermore, no obvious reduction in signal intensity was observed at the deletion sites [7]. In a second study, a new software algorithm was developed, ResqMi, that used intensity comparisons to enhance the call rates of resequencing microarray data [11]. Three different resequencing microarrays were analysed using ResqMi: 'CFTR' (targeting the human CFTR gene), 'SARS' (for the Corona virus causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), and 'Mito' (which became the Affymetrix MitoChip v.1.0). This software succeeded in resolving up to 10% of the N-calls on all three array types using GSEQ as the primary software. In a third study, another software algorithm, sPROFILER, succeeded in resolving more than 80% of N-calls from GSEQ software and allowed 99.6% of their resequencing array to be assigned a base call. An interesting observation in this study was the detection of a continuous stretch of 13 N-calls and a variant call that was attributable to a series of deleted bases in the TMPRSS3 gene [2].",

As the MitoChip's GSEQ software has no provision for detecting these, we compared the analysis of our mtDNA N-call distribution in the rCRS section using GSEQ, ResqMi and sPROFILER software, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may include indels in mtDNA. Furthermore, it has been reported that depending upon the sequence context, point mutations generally produce the weakest inhibition of probe annealing (least likely to produce an N-call), followed by deletions then insertions [12]. Thus, when searching for indels we expected the highest success would come from examining longer N-call stretches in a sample.",
