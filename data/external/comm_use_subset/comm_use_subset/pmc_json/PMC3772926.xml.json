However, limited data is available about the association of IL-33 and ST2 expression in viral diseases. IL-33 is over-expressed in influenza virus lung infection in mice [5,6] and IL-33 produced by necrotic cells drives protective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice [7]. Further, elevated levels of soluble ST2 (sST2) in sera of dengue virus infected patients [8] and HIV infected patients [9] were observed indicating sST2 as potential marker of viral infections.",

The increased level of serum IL-33 and sST2 was observed in acute and chronic hepatic failure in human [15]. Furthermore, elevated IL-33 serum level was also associated with liver damage in patients of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) [16] and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [17] infections, representing IL-33 as a possible indicator of viral hepatitis.",

The polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA (dsRNA), induces a moderate acute hepatic injury and mimics a model of viral hepatitis [18,19]. Poly(I:C) activated principally the intrahepatic macrophages (Kuppfer cells) and NK cells via TLR3 [20] leading to increase of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b2 [18,19,21,22]. A pretreatment with D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in Poly(I:C) injected-mice aggravated the acute hepatic injury which become lethal [19]. A natural animal model of viral hepatitis, the mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae family, induced acute and/or chronic hepatitis in mice mimicking human HBV infection and serve as a good tool to study immune dysfunction and cytokines associated with viral acute hepatitis [23,24]. The most hepatotropic serotype of MHV, the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), induced severe fulminant hepatitis in mice and their death within 3-5 days post-infection [25]. In liver, Kupffer cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial and vascular endothelial cells are the main target cells for MHV3 replication [26,27]. The histopathological lesions in liver were correlated with the levels of inflammatory cytokines [28]. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice were modulated by TLR receptor. We have previously demonstrated that intrahepatic NK cells decreased after a transient increase in liver from pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice due to virus-induced NK depletion [27].",

Regarding cellular sources of IL-33, the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells expressed IL-33 constitutively in PBS control mice livers and induced expression in these cells was observed following Poly(I:C) and D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 1B).

            "text": "The over-expression of IL-33 and ST2 is associated with acute and chronic liver diseases in mice and human. IL-33 and sST2 have shown to be up-regulated in acute on chronic and chronic hepatic failure [15] and in chronic HBV and HCV infections in human [14,16,17]. The cellular sources of IL-33 in viral fulminant hepatitis are not well known. Accordingly, the murine fulminant hepatic models of TLR3 agonist, Poly(I:C), and pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3) are relevant acute viral hepatic models in human. Thus, we aimed to know the expression and regulation of IL-33 in Poly(I:C) and L2-MHV3 induced hepatitis in mice. The Poly(I:C) administration in mice induced moderate hepatic injury while co-administration of D-GalN and Poly(I:C) led to very severe fulminant hepatitis in mice. The liver injury induced by D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment was associated with hemorrhagic lesions in liver and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines as reported earlier [19,21,22]. The underlying mechanism of Poly(I:C)-induced liver injury is mediated by activation of Kuppfer cells and NK cells in a TLR3 dependent pathway [20] in association with increased inflammatory cytokines. Inducible expression of IL-33 was found in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells following Poly(I:C) and D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment. However, hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident in Poly(I:C) treated mice with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes compared to control mice. It may be plausible that hepatocyte specific inhibition of transcription by D-GalN prevented hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression at transcript and protein level following D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment. However, innate immune stimulation by the TLR3 agonist alone can induce IL-33 expression in liver especially in hepatocytes. The regulation of IL-33 by TLR viral and bacterial ligands have been demonstrated in human corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts [30,31] as well as in murine macrophages [32]. The IL-33 was up-regulated by Poly(I:C) stimulation in murine macrophages and its transcriptional regulation was dependent of two transcription factors, IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and CREB [32]. Here, we add TLR3 mediated expression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes in acute hepatitis in mice in a pathophysiological context. In addition, TLR3 expression is also rapidly increased in liver from L2-MHV3 infected mice (results not shown).",

We demonstrated the cellular expression of IL-33 in sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes at various times of the fulminant viral hepatitis induced by L2-MHV3. The L2-MHV3-induced liver injury was associated with significant increases in serum transaminases ALAT/ASAT, viral nucleocapsid, IFN-\u03b2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chimiokine expression. The increased CXCL1 during MHV3 induced acute hepatitis may lead to chemotaxis/infiltration of neutrophils as an early response to liver infection and development of inflammatory microenvironment. The mechanism of MHV3-induced liver injury have shown to be dependent on activation of target cells of virus like Kupffer cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial and vascular endothelial cells [26,27]. Here we have shown that mRNA expression of IL-33 was over-expressed after L2-MHV3-induced hepatitis in mice. The transcript level of IL-33 was highly increased in L2-MHV3 induced hepatitis than Poly(I:C) treated mice demonstrating a difference between TLR-3 agonist and natural virus infection in liver. TLR3 expression is also rapidly increased in liver from L2-MHV3 infected mice (results not shown), suggesting that another factor may be also involved in the increase of IL-33. The hepatocyte-specific expression of IL-33 in hepatocytes was associated with beginning of L2-MHV3 induced liver injury (24, 28 and 32h) and the inducible expression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells was sustained during the whole infection period (16 to 72h).",

The depletion of NK cells by anti-AGSM1 antibody in mice did not inhibit increased liver injury in D-GalN sensitized Poly(I:C) treated mice and had any effect in Poly(I:C) alone administration. These results are contrary to earlier findings which showed that pre-depletion of NK cells protected mice against D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced liver injury [22]. The difference seemed to be related with kinetics and dose of D-GalN Poly(I:C) used in these studies. The significant increase in CXCL1 expression in NK-depleted mice may explain the interplay of immune cells migration in liver i.e. depletion of one immune cell population relatively compensate the other immune cell population. The major sources of CXCL1 in liver are endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes and neutrophils and CXCL1 in association with neutrophils is important for development of liver injury [33,34]. The IL-33 expression was induced in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. The down-regulation of hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in NK depleted mice in Poly(I:C) treated mice suggests a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. Interestingly, IL-33-expressing hepatocytes decreased at the same time than NK cells decreased in liver following L2-MHV3 infection [25], supporting the hypothesis of a regulatory role of NK cells in IL-33 expression in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "In a other relevant murine ConA-induced fulminant hepatic model, we have demonstrated that IL-33 is highly induced in liver especially in hepatocytes and the regulation of hepatocyte-specific IL-33 is dependent of NKT cells and TRAIL [10,13]. In the TLR-3 agonist model used in this study, NKT cells did not control IL-33 expression in Poly(I:C)-induced liver injury because NKT (CD1d) KO mice exhibited increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes than WT controls. These results may suggest a protective role of NKT cells in association with increased hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression during TLR3-mediated acute hepatitis. We and others have demonstrated such a protective role of NKT cells and IL-33 during ConA-induced liver injury model (Arshad et al. 2012, Hepatol, Volarevic et al. 2012, J Hepatol) that seems plausible in Poly(I:C)-induced acute liver injury. It has been previously reported that NKT cells did not decrease in liver following L2-MHV3 infection in mice in contrast to that observed with NK cells [25]. However, TRAIL level expression increased in Poly(I:C) treated mice, as previously observed in ConA-induced hepatic model [13].",
