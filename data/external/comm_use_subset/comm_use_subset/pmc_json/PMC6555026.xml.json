To better understand the epidemiology, including disease incidence and severity, a surveillance system must be implemented to collect data and inform public health authorities [2, 3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) established a global influenza surveillance network in 1952, which includes 136 National Influenza Centers in 106 countries [4]. Tunisia has been participating in the WHO global network through the Tunisian National Influenza Center, National Reference Influenza Laboratory (NIC), nominated and recognized by WHO since 1980. WHO recommends that influenza surveillance systems should be evaluated periodically, starting 1 to 2 years after their implementation in order to identify steps needed to fill gaps in performance [5]. This study is the first evaluation of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system since its implementation in 1980. We specifically aimed to: (i) provide a comprehensive understanding of how the Tunisian surveillance system operates; (ii) assess its performance and (iii) identify its strengths and weaknesses in order to improve it.",

The ILI sentinel sites were selected on the basis of their representativeness, their geographical\u2013demographical criteria and the presence of voluntary and motivated health professionals. Since the start of surveillance, data was collected using standardized forms that aggregated data into three age groups: 0\u20135 years; 6\u201315 years and \u2265 16 years [6]. In 2014, however, a new WHO ILI case definition was implemented with minimum data standards that included gender and age groups (0- < 2 years, 2- < 5 years, 5- < 15 years, 15- < 50 years, 50- < 65 years and \u2265 65 years) [7]. ILI sites report cases from the 40th week of the year in October, to the 18th week of the following year in April, which correspond to the influenza season that started and finish in relation to the cold period of the northern hemisphere and the passage of migratory birds [8] (http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/docs/anis/guidegripf6102016.pdf). The characteristics of the Tunisian influenza-like illness surveillance system are described in the Table 1.",

So we decided to evaluate the year of the new strategy implementation with two years before the project (pre-evaluation) to have a clear idea about the system performance at time zero, just when we started the new version of the surveillance system and to evaluate the changes in the future after the end of the project (post-evaluation). Surveillance system performance was assessed using the guidelines of the US-CDC [11]. Eight attributes were considered: (i) data quality and completeness; (ii) representativeness; (iii) timeliness; (iv) simplicity; (v) acceptability; (vi) flexibility; (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed. Indicators were analyzed, scored and a mean score was calculated for each attribute using a qualitative scale from 1 to 5, from very poor performance (1) to very good performance (5). In this scale, we have collapsed two categories for some questions: score 1 (strongly agree / agree); score 2 (mostly agree); score 3 (somewhat disagree); score 4 (Disagree/ strongly disagree) and score 5 (Do not know). We used surveillance databases collected at the National Surveillance Program of the Ministry of Health and the NIC. Standardized semi-structured and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect relevant data from surveillance staff at ILI sites, regional directorates, the DSSB and from the NIC.",

Measuring timeliness was not possible due to the incompleteness in reporting dates of collection, receipt, testing, and reporting. In this example, gaps in completeness of data affected the ability to objectively assess quality and timeliness of data. The timeliness of the system may be affected by the geographical distribution of sentinel sites and the simplicity of data collection and reporting methods. An electronic information management system was one of the most important recommendations proposed by surveillance staff to improve data completeness, quality monitoring and timeliness. It would facilitate real-time sharing of data [15]. A recent evaluation of a syndromic influenza sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar between 2009 and 2014 showed that by using mobile phones and texting for the transmission of daily aggregated data, the simplicity of the system was strengthened, improving the completeness, quality and timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the system to the sentinel site staff [16]. This is in line with the recommendation that a revised data management approach, which offers the advantage of automation and user-friendly interface, would ultimately improve the acceptance and utility of the surveillance system [17]. Utility and acceptability of the system were also moderate, with a mean score of 3.6 and 3.0, respectively.",

This is an area of vulnerability, as current material resources are limited, and may decrease acceptability of the system among staff.

We recommended enhancement of awareness and sensitivity of surveillance staff regarding the importance of key variables and to strengthen training on data collection and reporting. Inclusion of ILI sites in the influenza surveillance system should be revisited periodically by assessing timely reporting and quality and completeness of data collected. Moreover, an electronic information management system would improve completeness of key variables. On the other hand, the surveillance system presents a strong point in virologic surveillance internationally confirmed by the results from the WHO EQAP and participation in global influenza vaccine strain selection and WHO FluNet virologic monitoring. The foremost importance of the surveillance system is to detect the viruses causing and their activities for influenza-like illness rather than influenza. Improving the quality and completeness of virologic sampling and reporting is essential to guarantee the identification of circulating viruses and their local seasonality in Tunisia. The early detection and characterization of these viruses allow timely annual updates for a vaccine that can prevent deaths and alleviate illness in vulnerable groups. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were not included in this evaluation because of a lack of data. It is recommended to assess these attributes in the next surveillance system evaluation.",
