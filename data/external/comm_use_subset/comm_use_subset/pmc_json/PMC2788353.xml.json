            "text": "Signal peptides (SPs) are found at the N-terminus of precursor protein sequences [1]. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells utilize these short peptides to mediate the targeting and translocation of the passenger protein domains across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or the inner and outer membranes in prokaryotes. SPs are cleaved off from their passenger protein by the endoprotease SPase I [2] upon reaching their targeted destination. In sequence databases such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot [3] or EMBL [4], an important annotation task involves the identification of these SPs and the correct identification of their cleavage sites and the start of the mature protein sequences. However, the staggering rate at which unprocessed sequences are being deposited into the sequence databases easily outpaces the results from experimental methods. This has catalyzed the development of faster and more accurate computational methods to automate the task of SP prediction.",

Most importantly, the systematic functional annotation of biological sequences using Gene Ontology (GO) [10] requires a precise knowledge of the subcellular localization, where SP prediction has a fundamental input. Some of these prediction tools have been applied with varying degrees of success in genome-wide studies for the discovery of novel secretory proteins or large-scale analyses. Examples include the application in the large-scale Secreted Protein Discovery Initiative (SPDI) which sought to discover novel human secretory and transmembrane proteins in human [11]; identification of secreted proteins in 225 bacterial proteomes [12] and parasitic nematodes [13,14] and genomic analysis of the SARS-associated Tor2 isolate coronavirus [15]. Likewise, tools such as SignalP [16] are employed in the annotation of database sequence entries in which experimental evidence is lacking. SP prediction tools can be useful for locating homologous sequences or predicting the correct start codon since SPs are situated at the N-terminal of proteins [17].",

Earlier reviews [18] and [19] on SP prediction have focussed on comparisons of the machine learning techniques used, rather than evaluating the results of these methods. Except for the two benchmark studies by Meene et al. [9] in 2000 and Zhang and Henzel [20] in 2004, which were carried out solely to benchmark the various SP prediction tools available at that time, the majority of the comparison studies were conducted during the development of their respective prediction tool [5,16,17,21-30]. Often, such assessments involved only a subset of the prediction tools that are available or they were tested on a subset of sequences. For instance, the evaluation by Klee and Ellis [31] involved only a subset of the eukaryotic sequences and compared mainly four of the available programs, while Bagos et al. [32] evaluated a mix of putative and experimentally verified archaeal SPs. Furthermore, different datasets were used in the evaluation of some of these prediction tools, thus making it extremely difficult to engage in a fair comparison. In some cases, the performance indicators reported actually differ in the aspects that they were investigating (e.g. discrimination of SP or non-SP proteins OR/AND identification of the cleavage site) [28].",

The results are lower than those reported in the authors' publications using the same dataset. Manual inspection of Signal-3L revealed that there was a mistake quoted by the authors in their publication [29]. For the entry [Swiss-Prot: Q6UXL0], the authors reported the cleavage site as 28aa instead of the correct 29aa that the authors indicated in their supplied supplementary data (\"Online Supporting Information B: Signal-CF dataset - supp-B.txt\"). Thus, the tools that were evaluated may have been wrongly penalized (SignalP (version 3.0) and PrediSi [22]). From our examination, Signal-CF and Signal-3L identify the cleavage site at 63aa and 28aa respectively based on the input sequence of length 70aa. When we reduced its evaluation length to LENGTH(SP)+LENGTH(30aa of the mature peptide) which is 59aa in length (the sequence being: MQTFTMVLEEIWTSLFMWFFYALIPCLLTDEVAILPAPQNLSVLSTNMKHLLMWSPVIA) as reported in their publication, Signal-CF and Signal-3L reported SPs of 29aa and 28aa. Comparing the two tools, we noted that selecting the correct \"species\" option in Signal-3L is critical; otherwise a markedly different length of SP is reported. Signal-CF, on the other hand, is extremely sensitive to the different lengths. Additionally, it is unclear whether the additional classification of sequences into more specific groups (e.g. plant, human, animal etc.) adopted by Signal-3L is able to generate greater advantage over Signal-CF as we shall see in the other experiments.",

Also, the sequence window employed by SignalP are also relatively wider (Euk: [-11,+2] representing eleven residues prior to the cleavage site and two residues after the cleavage site, Gneg: [-21,+2], Gpos: [-15,+2]) compared to other methods, which are usually localized to a few residues flanking the SP cleavage location.

Indeed, some tools are more susceptible to changes in the databases, and they are likely to require regular update to their underlying models to reflect the latest observations for a given set of new sequences. This is particular so for alignment-based and matrix-based methods, where the updates will allow proper tuning of their model parameters.

The dataset is further processed following the protocol described in [33]. There are 2349 positive instances (Euk:1874; Gpos:168; Gneg:307), and this is matched by an equal number of negative instances for each organism group. The negative dataset is a mix of cytoplasmic and nuclear (applicable to Euk only) proteins. Proteins from other subcellular localizations are excluded since it is difficult to state unequivocally whether they are secreted [16]. Similarly, single-pass type II membrane proteins that contain signal anchors are skipped since the majority of the entries are predicted http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/lists?annbioch.txt and labelled \"Potential\". We use the \"KW\" field, instead of \"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION\" phrase under the \"CC\" field, to locate the cellular localization due to its more succinct description. Organellar proteins and proteins containing chloroplast or mitochondria transit peptides are also removed. Additionally, entries with the keyword \"Secreted\" appearing under the \"KW\" field are removed (e.g. [Swiss-Prot:F13A_HUMAN] which is cytoplasmic in most tissues, but it is secreted in the blood plasma as well). Finally, visual inspection is conducted to remove atypical sequences which consists of only Ms and Qs in its sequence (e.g. [Swiss-Prot:ATX8_HUMAN]). Sequences with SPs that are shorter/longer than the average in the positive set are not excluded, since such sequences do exist and they have been annotated and verified.",

This would minimize any advantage enjoyed by the tools in predicting SPs from sequences similar to those 'seen' before. Manual inspection of the preliminary filtered set reveals that many of the entries are putative despite the lack of indication in their annotations. Unlike the previous datasets, we are unable to comply with the filtering criteria [33] as it would eliminate 50% of eukaryotic instances and more than 90% of the bacterial sequences. Instead, putative SPs with high probability of existence upon consulting the accompanied literature are retained. However, entries with discrepancies in their report on the cleavage site from Swiss-Prot and the literature such as [Swiss-Prot:CEAM5_HUMAN] and [Swiss-Prot:FAS1_SCHAM], are removed, totalling fourteen eukaryotic sequences.
