Therefore, several construction strategies have been developed to increase the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation. To generate the recombinant AcMNPV, Patel et al. have developed a recombinant baculovirus shuttle strategy in yeast with yeast autonomous replicating sequences (ARS) and centromere (CEN) sequences [9]. An AcMNPV baculovirus shuttle vector (Bacmid) that can be manipulated in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a plasmid has also been reported [10, 11]. This Bacmid is commercially available as Bac-to-Bac BEVS. And also Kitts et al. have developed a BacPAK6 expression system [12] in which several Bsu36I sites have been introduced into the AcMNPV genome to allow preparation of linearized viral DNA with essential gene deficiency for cotransfection. Based on these typical strategies, several defective baculovirus expression system have been engineered. Je et al. have reported an AcMNPV Bacmid system that lack a portion of the essential ORF1629 gene [13]. Jones et al. have also reported the inactivation of this essential gene to improve baculovirus recombination [14]. Furthermore, multigene expression has been achieved by some groups [15, 16].",

Some virus encoded proteins involved in ODV structure are not required to maintain virus cell to cell infectivity or virus replication. [24\u201326]. For example, the polyhedrin and p10 genes are not involved in within host virus infection or replication, and thus their promoters are used to drive the expression of foreign proteins [16]. The products of some virus genes, such as cathepsin (cat) and chitinase (chi), can impede foreign gene expression, and hence foreign gene expression efficiency increases in the absence of these two genes [27\u201329].",

The cat and chi genes in the reBmBac genome were inactivated [29] and replaced by an E. coli CopyControl origin of replication [33] to make the baculovirus viral genome DNA easy to manipulate and prepare in E. coli. The ORF1629 gene is essential to the virus life cycle because it encodes the viral capsid-associated protein [34]. This essential gene was stably and partially deleted in E. coli to construct the defective-rescue bacmid and ensure the efficiency and purity of the recombinant baculoviruses obtained through cotransfection [12]. In addition, a general manipulation method for any gene site in the baculovirus genome was established. The reporter gene luciferase (luc) as quality control and porcine gene interferon \u03b3 (PoIFN-\u03b3) were successfully expressed by using this system.",

            "text": "The BmNPV-silkworm expression system has been reported that it is a powerful and potential system for foreign gene expression. Scientists have long attempted to develop more convenient methods for generation of recombinant BmNPV and high-level expression of recombinant proteins in silkworm. The recombinant baculovirus generation strategies of BmNPV are similar to those corresponding ones of AcMNPV [46]. The Bac-to-Bac system and the BacPAK system are two typical and commonly used baculovirus expression system. A foreign gene can be inserted into BmNPV baculovirus DNA in E. coli by using the Bm-Bac-to-Bac system, which is a convenient and easy-to-used expression vector for recombinant baculovirus construction and expression [17]. There were studies shown that the recombinant Bacmid DNA or special E. coli containing Bacmid could be used to inject the silkworm directly for expression, but the expression efficiency and level were not ideal [17, 47]. The Bac-to-Bac system is widely used in the BEVS expression fields, which benefit from the convenience and stabilization of its operation in E. coli. However, this system is also relatively inconvenient for the heterologous expression of many genes because each gene must be manipulated independently in E. coli. In the BmBacPAK system, there are several Bsu36I sites in baculovirus DNA [48]. The Bsu36I digested baculovirus DNA is linear and lacks part of ORF1629. Incomplete enzyme digestion dramatically reduces the ratio of recombinant virus. In comparison with these two BEVSs, the reBmBac expression system combines their advantages, i.e., convenient viral genome DNA preparation in E. coli and easy recombinant baculovirus production via cotransfection. The stable deletion of the essential ORF1629 gene in E. coli beforehand made the digestion step could be omitted and ensured the efficiency and purity of recombinant baculoviruses that were obtained by cotransfection. In addition, some disadvantages of these two BEVSs were avoided. It always takes at least two weeks to produce one recombinant baculovirus using Bac-to-Bac BEVS, whereas it takes only approximately five days when using reBmBac BEVS to produce various recombinant baculoviruses that contain different genes of interest at the same time. The batch production of different baculoviruses can be achieved conveniently via one-step cotransfection, and thus, a large amount of time is saved. It is much more convenient to prepare a large amount of high-quality parental viral genome DNA by using the reBmBac BEVS rather than the BmBacPAK system because of the CopyControl ori [33]. Besides, the ORF1629-defective Bacmid bBpGOZA expression system is another easy-to-use system [19]. Our reBmBac system has two major improvements relative to this system. First, the fragment replaced during homologous recombination in our reBmBac system is only a 1.2 kb tetR gene. In contrast, the fragment in bBpGOZA is more than 6 kb, and it contains a miniF replicon and a kanR gene. Second, the CopyControl origin in our system facilitates the large-scale preparation of high-quality reBmBac DNA. Our results over the course of many experiments indicated that the high quality of reBmBac DNA and transfer plasmid DNA are key factors for achieving good recombination results. We observed a greater than fivefold difference in the luciferase expression level and the expression levels of other proteins of interest depending on the quality of the DNA (S2 Table). The quality of well-preserved (fresh or store at -20\u00b0C) and bad-preserved (freeze-thawed for five rounds) transfer vectors are different. And the quality of parent reBmBac viral DNA, extracted from E. coli by induction or non-induction methods, are different. Over many protein expression trials in this reBmBac system, we found that when we used the same amount but different quality of pVL1393-luc transfer vector DNA to mix with the same tube of reBmBac DNA and to cotransfect cells, the luminescence from the cells and larvae could reach a tenfold difference. When we use the same amount but different quality of reBmBac DNA to mix with the same tube of well-preserved pVL1393-luc vector and to carry out the cotransfection, the luminescence from cells and larvae were at least fivefold different.",

The amount of recombinant virus from one cotransfection was sufficient to infect at least 5,000 silkworm larvae or pupae. The expression was sufficiently high to perform functional research on the expressed protein. Furthermore, the three continuous rounds of viral reproduction demonstrated that the efficiency and purity of recombinant BmNPV were sufficient for virus amplification and protein expression. The plaque assays of reBm-luc and reBm-PoIFN-\u03b3 showed that the reBmBac system allows 100% recombinant BmNPV formation. Combining the three rounds of amplification test, the direct expression in silkworms obviates the need for further virus plaque purification assay. Therefore, the time required from expression plasmid production to harvesting a large amount recombinant protein is only 10 days, in theory. Obtaining recombinant virus requires only a simple cotransfection, which could be performed in batch mode and would be suitable for the expression of different foreign proteins after batches. In general, we performed 8\u201312 cotransfections in two 6-well cell culture plates (6 x 35 mm) for one batch and used the luciferase reporter to evaluate the recombination and expression efficiency in silkworms. We were confident that a group of recombinations and gene expression trial in the silkworms was successful when the luminescence of the cell lysate from the cotransfection reached 2 x 106 RLU or greater, and the larval haemolymph achieved 5 x 107 RLU or greater. These features are beneficial for the rapid and efficient expression of foreign proteins.",

The same phenomenon sometimes appears in the using of BacPAK6 system. Here, the stable expression data in the three rounds indicated that the reBm-luc acquired in cotransfection was pure and could be used for expression directly. In the plaque assay of reBm-luc, all of the screened virus stocks drive positive expression of luciferase. But the expression levels of them were steadily different. This is because of the reBm-luc acquired in cotransfection is a mixture of various types of recombinant viruses, while the screened virus stock is single clone recombinant virus in theory. Therefore, the expression level of luciferase of 24 plaque stocks were higher or lower than that of contransfection virus stock. And the plaque assay of reBm-PoIFN-\u03b3 also verified this result. Even so, the several virus stocks that drive higher expression levels could be selected for further researches or large-scale expression of target genes. Generally, the expression levels of these optimized recombinant virus stocks could be at least twofold higher than that of cotransfection stock. This optimization of expression level is recommended step for further large-scale producing.",

The oriV origin of replication should be silent during genetic manipulations in baculovirus genome. The single-copy replicon allows for the autonomous replication and stable segregation of plasmids at a low number, which facilitates positive clone selection. The high-copy oriV origin of replication is induced when it is necessary to prepare Bacmid DNA for cotransfection. High-quality reBmBac DNA, which can be prepared easily on a large scale, is one of the key factors for successful homologous recombination.

The tetR gene was replaced with a foreign gene during cotransfection. The chlR gene was deleted with the FLP/FRT system and the rpsL-neo counter-resistance selection system. The deletion of the chlR gene was also an example of the genetic manipulation of viral genes or the introduction of foreign genes into the other baculoviral genome sites in E. coli. This makes the multigene expression can also be achieved by using our reBmBac expression system as the using of other published system in silkworms [49]. The FRT site used here is a mutant site [43, 44]. The remaining FRT sequence is inactivated after recombination, which is favourable for ensuring the stability of the viral genome.",

The examples of luciferase and PoIFN-\u03b3 expression showed that foreign genes can be successfully expressed with this system. These results show that the novel reBmBac silkworm expression system is excellent and has the following advantages: (i) This system allows for simple and rapid generation of recombinant BmNPVs carrying foreign genes. Because the defective ORF1629 and the introduction of the CopyControl origin of replication, the purity of the recombinant virus harvested during cotransfection approaches 100%. The luciferase expression level could be used as the quality control for the cotransfection and expression efficiency of foreign genes in larvae. The amount and quality of recombinant viral stock is sufficient for various research applications. Plaque purification can be used to further improve the expression level but is not a necessary step. (ii) This system facilitates the batch generation of recombinant BmNPV with various foreign genes, thus allowing for the mass production of proteins of interest. (iii) No antibiotic resistance gene is present in recombinant BmNPV, and thus the biosafety of this system is ensured.",
