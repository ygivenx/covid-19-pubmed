This family is comprised of five established genera, Lagovirus, Nebovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Vesivirus [2], with six additional unclassified new genera tentatively named Recovirus [3], Bavovirus [4, 5] Nacovirus [5\u20137], Salovirus [8], Sanovirus [9], and Valovirus [10]. The members in this family are important pathogens in both medical and veterinary fields [1]. For example, feline calicivirus (FCV) belonging to the genus Vesivirus causes acute, self-lining oral and upper respiratory tract disease in cats [11]. Moreover, virulent, systemic FCV mutant strains causing severe systemic diseases with edematous and ulcerative skin lesions, jaundice, and a high mortality of up to 67% have recently been found in the US and EU [12\u201314]. Porcine sapovirus (PSaV), and bovine norovirus and nebovirus cause widespread acute gastroenteritis in piglets and calves, respectively [15\u201317]. In the medical field, human norovirus and human sapovirus, especially the former, is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans, accounting for ~200,000 deaths per annum in children <5 [18\u201319].",

A lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system for human noroviruses (HNoVs) has not been developed until recently, thereby hindering the development of effective interventions [21]. Therefore, our understanding of the HNoV life cycle was largely based on those surrogate viruses specifically the murine noroviruses (MNVs) [22]. Therapeutic candidates for FCV and MNV may be utilized for various FCV strains and HNoVs [13].",

Currently three isoforms of COXs have been identified, with COX-1 and COX-2 being the most studied [29]. COX-1 functions as a housekeeping isoform of COX and is expressed constitutively to perform functions such as control of renal blood flow, platelet aggregation, and provide protection against stomach ulcers [29]. COX-2 is activated in response to different extracellular or intracellular stimuli, which can lead to the accumulation of PGs including PGE2 [30]. PGE2 is commonly involved in cellular immunity and inflammation events, and serves as strong regulators of cell\u2013cell interaction, cytokine production, antigen presentation, cell differentiation and survival, apoptosis, and cell migration [30].",

However, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) arterivirus has been shown to hijack the COX-1/PGE2 signaling pathway and induce fever [35], and pseudorabies herpesvirus has been shown to use both COX-1 and COX-2/PGE2 pathways for its successful replication [54]. In contrast, in vitro and/or in vivo treatment of PGE2 reduces replication of hepatitis B virus [43, 55], adenoviruses [44], parainfluenza virus [56], and measles virus [45], suggesting an antiviral function of PGE2 to these viruses. Moreover, the COXs/ PGE2 signaling pathway or their final product PGE2 has been shown to facilitate or inhibit the replication of viruses in the same family. For example, in the Retroviridae family, the COXs/PGE2 signaling pathway and/or PGE2 enhances the replication of bovine leukemia virus [38], as well as human T-cell leukemia virus-I [57] and III [58], but inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in monocyte-derived macrophage [59]. It should be noted that treatment of PGE2 enhances the replication of HIV-1 in the CD4+ T-cell line MT-4 [60], indicating also that depending on the cells, the role of COXs/PGE2 signaling pathways is different in the same viral infection.",

Pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs against COX-1 and COX-2 significantly reduced PSaV replication, which was restored by the addition of PGE2, indicating that COXs/PGE2 acts as a proviral signal [34]. However, the role of COXs/PGE2 signaling is unknown for other members within the Caliciviridae family. This prompts us to investigate whether other members of caliciviruses, in particular the FCV and MNV strains, use the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway in the regulation of their own replication. Here, we demonstrated that COX-2 expression was induced during FCV and MNV infections, thereby causing a surge in PGE2 levels. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes significantly reduced PGE2 production as well as MNV and FCV replication, which could be restored by the addition of PGE2. These results suggest that COX-2/PGE2 pathway has proviral effects for FCV and MNV replication.",

To investigate this, we first evaluated the influence of FCV and MNV infections on COX gene and protein expressions. Expression levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein gradually increased from 1 h post-infection (hpi) (Fig 1A and 1C) in parallel with increased FCV viral RNA synthesis (Fig 1B), while COX-1 protein levels remained unchanged (Fig 1A and 1C). Similarly, the time-dependent increase in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in association with an increase in MNV mRNA level starting at 4 hpi (Fig 2A\u20132C). The expression level of COX-1 mRNA and protein was also unaffected during MNV infection (Fig 2A and 2C). Since PGE2 is one of the main products of the COX enzymes [29], we also assessed the expression levels of PGE2 during FCV and MNV infections. Concurrent with the increased COX-2 levels during MNV and FCV infections, the production of PGE2 was also elevated in a time-dependent manner starting from 1 hpi for FCV (Fig 1D) and from 4 hpi for MNV (Fig 2D).",

Similarly, addition of COX inhibitors after removal of the MNV inoculum or during the entire course of the MNV infection reduced PGE2 levels (Fig 3D\u20133F). However, the pretreatment of cells and consequent removal of inhibitors before FCV or MNV infection did not lower PGE2 levels due to the reversible nature of the inhibitors (Fig 3A\u20133F).",

RAW 267.4 and CRFK cells were pre-treated (Pre), post-treated (Post), or pre-post-treated (Pre-Post) with COX inhibitors, and viral replication was monitored at 8 hpi for FCV and 24 hpi for MNV by examining the viral titers and RNA levels. The selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 reduced the levels of infectious virus and RNA ~3 log10 for FCV (Fig 4A and 4B) and by ~4 log10 for MNV (Fig 5A and 5B) when added after infection (post-treatment) or maintained throughout the virus infection (pre-post-treatment). Conversely, the addition of NS-398 (selective COX-2 inhibitor) following the removal of the virus inoculum (post-treatment) or during the entire progression of infection (pre-post-treatment) caused a more significant reduction in FCV (~4.5 log10) in both infectious virus and viral RNA (Fig 4C and 4D), while MNV infectious viral titer and genome copy numbers were reduced ~3 log10 (Fig 5C and 5D). Indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, showed more significant effects on MNV infection, leading to a ~5 log10 reduction in virus yield and RNA synthesis (Fig 5E and 5F), while FCV infection elicited a ~3 log10 decrease in infectious viral titer and genome copy numbers (Fig 4E and 4F) when added after virus adsorption or maintained throughout the course of the infection. There was no significant effect on FCV or MNV replication in cells pretreated with COX inhibitors (Figs 4A\u20134F and 5A\u20135F). We also assessed the effect of COX-specific siRNAs on FCV and MNV replication. FCV genome copy numbers and titers were more strongly reduced (~4 log10) in cells transfected with siRNA against COX-2 than that in cells transfected with COX-1 siRNA (~2 log10) (Fig 4G and 4H). Transfection of COX-1- or COX-2-specific siRNAs resulted in similar substantial reduction in MNV replication, causing a ~4 log10 decrease in infectious viral titer and RNA levels (Fig 5G and 5H).",

In the present study, both FCV and MNV strongly activated the COX-2/PGE2 pathway from an early replication time point. These results are different from our previous finding where the PSaV strain Cowden, belonging to the same Caliciviridae family, induced late activation of the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway [34]. This suggested that the activation time of the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway was different even in the same Caliciviridae family. In addition, the PSaV Cowden strain transiently activated COX-1/PGE2 signaling during the later stage of infection [34]. Interestingly, no increases in the COX-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed during the entire FCV and MNV infection. However, silencing of COX-1 by specific siRNAs as well as the inhibition of COX-1 by the specific inhibitor SC-560 decreased the production of PGE2 and replication of both viruses. Although the detailed mechanism of these results is unknown, it is presumed that the inhibition of the basal expression level of COX-1 by its specific inhibitor and siRNA suppressed PGE2 production and thereby the replication of both viruses. Based on these results, it could be concluded that unlike the PSaV-induced late activation of both COX-1 and COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathways, both FCV and MNV activate only COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway from early replication, but COX-1 might be an important factor for the successful replication of FCV and MNV.",

In the present study, the inhibition or silencing of COX-2 reduced replication of FCV and MNV. Moreover, reduced viral replication by COX inhibitors was restored by addition of PGE2. Similar results have been recently reported in a PSaV infection study [34]. These data indicate that like PSaV [34], FCV- and MNV-induced activation of the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway acts as a proviral mechanism for the replication of FCV and MNV.",

NSAIDs have been reported as potential therapeutic drugs for some viral infection. For example, pharmacological use of a COX-2 inhibitor in combination with neuraminidase inhibitors enhanced the survival of mice infected with H5N1 influenza [71]. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was shown to protect mice from succumbing to dengue virus-2 infection [41]. In this study, we determined the potency of different COX inhibitors against FCV and MNV infections. In the FCV infection, the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS398 exerted ~4 log10 suppression in the FCV titer compared to other inhibitors. Among the COX inhibitors tested against MNV, indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, showed stronger anti-MNV effects than other inhibitors, leading to a ~5 log10 decrease in MNV titer. These results suggest that COX inhibitors are potential candidates for the treatment of FCV infections, which are particularly serious problems for cats [12, 14]. Future studies are needed to determine whether in vivo treatments with COX inhibitors are effective in treating FCV and MNV infections.",

In vitro and in vivo vesicular stomatitis virus infection has been shown to activate the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway, which in turn restrict NO production [37, 46].

In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, viral nucleocapsid protein activates COX-2/PGE2 pathway through direct binding to regulatory elements for NF-\u03baB and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [80]. In our previous report, PSaV VPg and ProPol proteins significantly enhanced the expression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway [34].
