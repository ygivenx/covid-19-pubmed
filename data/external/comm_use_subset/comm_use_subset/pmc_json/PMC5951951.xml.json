This genus harbors viruses that infect domestic and wildlife animal species, including porcine circoviruses (PCV-1 and -2), canary circovirus (CaCV) and beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) of birds2\u20135. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has recently allowed the discovery of additional mammalian circoviruses including PCV-3 in pigs6 and canine circovirus-1 (CanineCV-1) in dogs1. Infection with CanineCV-1, recently re-classified as \u2018CanineCV\u20197, has been associated with several disease entities accompanied by manifestations like vasculitis, hemorrhages, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and diarrhea2,7\u20139, although it is also detected in healthy dogs1,8,10. Interestingly, dogs infected with CanineCV are often co-infected with other enteric or respiratory pathogens2,7,10,11. Therefore, the pathogenic role of CanineCV is not clear. To date, CanineCV-infected dogs have been documented in several countries including the USA1,8,11, Italy9, Germany7, China (GenBank accession number: KT946839) and Taiwan2.",

            "text": "Besides genetic mutation, recombination is a driver of circovirus evolution, as several previous studies have shown genetic recombination within the Circoviridae family. These include BFDV12, Torque teno virus13 and PCV-214\u201317, and have contributed to genetic diversity of these viruses. Types of recombination mechanisms include homologous recombination in which homologous sequences are exchanged, non-homologous recombination in which genome regions are rearranged, deleted, duplicated or inserted into the host genome and reassortment in which whole genome components of the virus get exchanged between strains and species18. In homologous recombination, any interruption during replication, such as the encounter of strand break sites or clashes between replication and transcription complexes, can create temporary detachment of the replication enzyme. The enzyme can then use another similar template to reinitiate replication, thus generating a recombinant genome18. Thus far, genetic recombination of CanineCV genomes has not been documented. In the present study, we have molecularly characterized CanineCV strains from Thai dogs by next generation sequencing with special emphasis on the occurrence of genetic recombination.",

Only partial CanineCV sequences were obtained by NGS analysis. Additional sequences were obtained using conventional PCR strategies based on primers designed from the NGS output sequences. The resulting consensus sequences represented ~92% of the complete CanineCV genome and confirmed the detection of this virus in both dogs, with the two strains named CanineCV_14P105D/TH2016 (accession no. MG737378) and CanineCV_14P112N/TH2016 (accession no. MG737386), respectively. Moreover, conventional PCR specific for CanineCV showed positive results in six out of the 20 nasal swabs, namely those coming from CP_28, CP_134, CP_144, CP_182, CP_188 and CP_191, and lung sample of dog no. 15P061D. The genomes of CanineCV in the swab samples were named CanineCV_CP28/TH2016 (MG737380), CanineCV_CP134/TH2016 (MG737381), CanineCV_CP144/TH2016 (MG737382), CanineCV_CP182/TH2016 (MG737383), CanineCV_CP188/TH2016 (MG737384), CanineCV_CP191/TH2016 (MG737385) and in the additional lung tissue sample, CanineCV_15P061D/TH2016 (MG737379).",

The similarity generated plot for CanineCV\u2019s TH/2016 revealed that these strains had high nucleotide identity to a CanineCV UCD3-478 (pink line) in the initial Rep gene region and a region of the Cap gene. The CanineCV TH/2016 genomes also showed obvious nucleotide similarity to the CanineCV JZ98/2014 strain (blue line) in the middle portion of Rep gene (Fig. 3A).

It was shown that these clustered into two distinct lineages. The majority of CanineCV\u2019s in Thailand represented a lineage that also contained the closely related CanineCV UCD3-478 from the USA8. However, CanineCV CP191/TH2016 was most closely related to CanineCV JZ98/2014, from China. Surprisingly, pairwise distance analysis of CanineCV\u2019s from Thailand showed at least 10.5% genetic difference from a previously characterized and related virus even though they were all present in the same lineage, thus suggesting the detection of novel strains of CanineCV in this study. Preliminary analysis of CanineCV\u2019s detected in Thailand revealed discordant phylogenetic relationship with other CanineCV\u2019s. For instance, the CanineCV\u2019s TH2016 clustered with CanineCV UCD3-478 when compared by analysis of complete genomes and Cap genes. However, they differentially clustered within a new lineage together with the CanineCV UCD3-478 strain when the phylogenetic tree was based on analysis of the Rep gene. Such paradoxical results indicate recombination events during CanineCV TH/2016 evolution. Therefore, we used boot scanning, phylogenetic incongruity, genetic marker identifications and additional sequence analyses to detect recombination events that may have occurred in circulating CanineCV\u2019s, enabling the identification of recombination breakpoints occurring in putative recombinant CanineCV\u2019s TH/2016. Here, we showed a recombination breakpoint at base positions 380\u2013820, located in the Rep gene, which overlaps the putative ORF3 region. The Rep gene encoded by ORF1, plays a critical role in viral replication19\u201321, whereas ORF2 encodes the immunogenic icosahedral capsid protein22,23.",

However, intra- and inter-genotypic recombination events have also been documented to occur in the Cap gene of other circoviruses26,27. Mixed infections are a predisposing factor for homologous recombination. The recombination patterns that are generated can be influenced likewise by different mechanistic factors. These include the ori site, secondary structure features, sequence similarity and replication/transcription discongruities among other factors28,29. In the present study, the presence of a strain (CanineCV CP191/TH2016) most closely related to CanineCV JZ98/2014, indicates that the strain from which the nt region 380\u2013820 of the recombinant viruses derives, circulates in Thailand. Therefore, we speculate that homologous recombination during a mixed infection has most likely generated the present recombinant strain. However, with the present data, it is not clear which mechanistic factor influenced the occurrence of the discussed recombination event. Moreover, a recent study on PCV2 revealed that the virus may have gradually evolved into several strains due to selective pressure such as vaccination by promoting a change of viral capsid protein away from the vaccine specific antigenic determinants30,31. Furthermore, in addition to a recombination breakpoint in CanineCV\u2019s TH/2016, a point mutation (nt 333) in Rep gene (nt 333) was observed in CanineCV-CP191 TH/2016, a mutation observed previously in only two Italian CanineCVs AZ4133-1/13, KT734815 and AZ4133-2/13, KT734827).

Recent studies showed that ORF3-deficient PCV2 were less pathogenic in mice in comparison to analogous infections with wild type strains34.

Retrospective studies on historical samples taken from CanineCV-infected dogs may provide answers as to when such a recombinant virus first emerged. The identification of such genetic recombination events among CanineCV\u2019s also supports whole genome sequencing as an alternative to phylogenetic analysis based on only single genome regions. Further applied studies should be undertaken into the functioning of CanineCV proteins, to better understand how mutations and/or recombination events alter CanineCV pathogenesis and transmission.",

These alignments were used to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood method with TN93+G for complete genome, K2+G model for Rep gene and HKY+G for Cap gene as best-fit model of nucleotide substitution according to Bayesian Information Criterion40. All phylogenetic trees were tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Sequence pairwise distances of CanineCV genomes were calculated using Maximum Composite Likelihood model43. The evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA 744. In order to identify the possibly recombinant origin(s) of CanineCV TH/2016 strains, a recombination detection program 4 (RDP4) package v. Beta 4.94, an integrated software program45 was used. Briefly, the recombination events of CanineCV\u2019s TH/2016 were detected by using a range of recombination detection methods including RDP, GeneConv, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimera, SiScan and 3Seq with cut-off acceptable p-value at 0.01.

The bootscan analysis was tested under the Kimura-2 parameter (K2P) model for 100 replications, with a window size of 200 bp, step size of 20 bp and a transition/transversion ratio of 2. The similarity plot was performed under the same group and conditions with GapStrip model.
