The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century emerged in 2009, with a novel swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) H1N1 as the causative agent. Originating in Mexico, it rapidly spread to North America and then globally [1]\u2013[4]. Of more concern, however, is the continual outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, an influenza A subtype virus circulating in poultry, which has caused hundreds of human diseases with severe morbidity and high mortality since its re-emergence in 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_12_09/en/index.html). Although genetic analysis of H5N1 isolated from humans revealed that all genes were of avian origin, limited person-to-person transmission of H5N1 viruses was identified [5]. Now the concern is that future influenza epidemics may be caused by new virus strains derived from mutations and/or reassortments of existing influenza viruses, particularly HPAI H5N1. Therefore, the development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures against IAV, particularly avian H5N1, is urgently needed.",

Current efforts to develop HPAI H5N1 vaccines are mainly focused on inactivated vaccines, which have been demonstrated to be effective in animal models for protection of H5N1 infection and to induce neutralizing antibodies in about 70% of human volunteers [6]\u2013[8]. The other H5N1 vaccine candidates, such as those based on live-attenuated virus [9], viral vectors [10], virus-like particles (VLP) [11], DNA vaccines [12] and recombinant proteins [13], have also been tested in animal models [14], [15], and even evaluated in clinical trials [16]. However, because of the rapid mutation of hemagglutinin (HA) protein of HPAI H5N1 virus, the cross-protective immunity of these vaccines is fundamentally restricted, highly limiting their potential use against divergent H5N1 viruses.",

For example, fusion of Fc to HIV-1 protein has also been shown to increase the immunogenicity of fusion proteins and to elicit neutralizing antibody responses [22], [23]. This is explained by the ability of Fc to promote correct folding of the fusion proteins following expression and the possibility that IgG Fc may help to enhance binding to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and cell lines expressing Fc receptors (FcR) [22], [24]. The foldon (Fd) sequence derived from native T4 phage fibritin has been typically incorporated at the C-terminus of collagen-like protein molecules to facilitate stabilization of protein trimer or oligomer [25], [26], indicating that C-terminal Fd is essential for correct trimerization and folding of the protein [27].",

The recombinant proteins of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc will be expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1) [28], followed by purification of the proteins from the supernatant. Both proteins maintained a high level of expression, with approximately 10 mg obtained in 250 ml culture medium. After purification, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining, and reactivity was determined using a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed in our laboratory [29]. As shown in Fig. 2A, one clear band was observed in samples of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that highly purified proteins could be obtained from transfected culture supernatant. The purified recombinant proteins of HA1 could be recognized by the HA-specific mAb, as indicated by Western blot (Fig. 2B), revealing their high specificity to the HA of H5N1.",

An average end-point antibody titer of 1\u22362.1\u00d7108 was detected in mouse sera collected at 10 days post-last boost (Fig. 3B). Antibody levels were further detected by coating the ELISA plates with a HA1 protein without fusing Fc and Fd to eliminate antibody response potentially induced by the fusion tag Fc and/or Fd. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, sera of mice vaccinated with the fusion proteins, particularly HA1-Fdc, reacted strongly with this HA1 protein, reaching an end-point titer of 1\u22361.3\u00d7107, demonstrating that the antibody responses induced by the expressed proteins were mainly targeted the HA1 protein. It was further shown that the induced IgG antibodies could also react with an inactivated heterologous virus A/VietNam/1194/2004(H5N1) (VN/1194), having a similar end-point antibody titer of 1\u22361.3\u00d7107 (Fig. 3D).

In this proof-of-concept study, we first demonstrated that the fusion of viral HA1 antigen, with either Fc alone or both Fd and Fc, was able to induce cross-neutralizing antibodies strong enough against various subtypes of H5N1 virus, which, in turn, could provide cross-protection against infections of different clades of H5N1 virus in cell cultures in vitro and in mouse models in vivo. Thus, our data suggest the possibility of developing universal H5N1 influenza vaccines by using such innovative strategies as fusion of viral antigens with Fd and Fc, as reported in this study. Future studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanism of the cross-protective immunity induced by the proposed candidate vaccines.",
