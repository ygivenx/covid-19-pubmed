Wolbachia is a maternally-transmitted endosymbiont that can rapidly become established in the natural mosquito populations and can inhibit a variety of pathogens, including arboviruses, malaria parasites, and filarial nematodes [10\u201315]. Wolbachia control strategies are currently being deployed into the field to alter the capacity of Aedes aegypti to transmit arboviruses or to suppress mosquito populations [16\u201318]. Surveillance of transinfected mosquitoes as well as natural vector populations is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions [19]. However, most current screening methods rely on PCR, which is expensive and relies on laboratory facilities. In addition to screening for Wolbachia infection, it would also be desirable to identify the host mosquito species using these assays since different mosquito species differ in their ability to transmit pathogens [20]. Knowledge of vector species, and prevalence and stability of Wolbachia is essential for effective vector control and pre-emption of disease outbreaks with public health measures [21].",

This process can be tedious, and requires highly trained personnel and undamaged mosquitoes. Alternative morphological methods such as the identification of morphometric wing characters [22] are low throughput and require microscopes and complex imaging instruments. Moreover, traditional morphological-based approaches cannot detect associated symbionts or pathogens. These limitations restrict widespread accessibility and necessitate sample preservation and transport. On the other end of the spectrum, immunoassay-based tools for identifying pathogen-infected mosquitoes, such as VecTest dipsticks (Medical Analysis Systems Inc.), are portable and inexpensive.

However, since molecular testing is currently heavily reliant on PCR [26\u201328], opportunities for field-based determinations are limited, leading to significant delays and gaps in actionable surveillance. To support widespread vector surveillance inexpensive, portable, nucleic acid diagnostic platforms are needed that rapidly produce accurate results without requiring complex procedures, instruments, and laboratory infrastructure. In this regard, isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have begun to be employed because they do not require complex thermocycling instruments [29\u201331]. However, although LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity it often produces spurious amplicons, which in turn lead to false positive readouts with non-specific reporters such as Mg2+ precipitation or fluorescent dye intercalation [32\u201334].",

The single stranded \u2018toehold\u2019 regions of OSD probes bind to LAMP amplicon loop sequences, and then signal via strand exchange [40] that leads to separation of a fluorophore and quencher [39]. OSDs are the functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and can specifically report single or multiplex LAMP amplicons without interference from non-specific nucleic acids or inhibitors [39, 41]. OSDs significantly enhance the diagnostic applicability of LAMP, allowing it to match the allelic specificity of real-time PCR. Recently, we engineered these molecular innovations to function fluently in one-pot LAMP-OSD reactions that can directly amplify a few tens to hundreds of copies of DNA and RNA analytes from minimally processed specimens and produce sequence-specific fluorescence signals that are easily observable by the human eye or (more importantly) by unmodified cellphone cameras [42]. The fluorescence endpoints that are produced can be used for yes/no determinations of the presence of an analyte, and also estimation of analyte copies on an order of magnitude scale [42, 43].",

However, ability of the wsp assay to identify Wolbachia infection was influenced by the storage temperature of mosquitoes. The wsp LAMP assay could readily identify Wolbachia infection in 3 out of 4 Ae. albopictus mosquitoes stored at -20\u00b0C for as long as 3 weeks. PCR analysis of the wsp-negative mosquito using previously described primers (81F and 691R) and protocols [28] did not produce amplicons suggesting that this individual was likely uninfected or had Wolbachia levels below the levels detectable by PCR. As the storage temperature was increased the frequency of Wolbachia detection dropped. While 40% of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes stored at 4\u00b0C gave a positive wsp LAMP-OSD signal, none of the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes kept at 37\u00b0C for even as little as 1 week were wsp positive. All mosquitoes that failed to generate a signal by LAMP also failed to produce wsp PCR amplicons. Since, 95\u201399% of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in the wild are typically found to be infected with Wolbachia [58], these results are suggestive of nucleic acid deterioration in mosquitoes upon storage at high temperature.",

First, without prior knowledge of integration sites, nucleic acid amplification tests will be unable to differentiate wsp target sequences derived from infectious Wolbachia bacterial genomes versus Wolbachia DNA integrated in nuclear genomes of hosts such as Drosophila ananassae [77]. However, other PCR-based assays also face this challenge. Second, nucleic acid amplification may not be significantly diminished by the presence of one or two mismatches between a primer and its target binding site [41, 78]. While, ability to generate a positive signal from very closely related target variants that differ by only one or two nucleotides is desirable, it is important for a nucleic acid test to distinguish polymorphic strains. Unlike two-primer systems such as qPCR, use of at least six primer binding sites during LAMP allows LAMP primers to scan a three times larger target sequence space for distinguishable polymorphisms. As a result, LAMP assays are more likely to distinguish unexpected polymorphic strains due to the likelihood of encountering mismatches in multiple primers that would in turn lead to diminution of amplification and false positive signals.",

In addition, this technology could be used to identify gut microbes and insect-specific viruses associated with mosquitoes, which is of growing interest given that it is becoming clear that the microbiome can shape vector competence for human pathogens [83\u201385].
