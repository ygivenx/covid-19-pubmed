            "text": "Pathogens elucidate two broad types of biochemical responses in the host. First is the activation of the host immune system. While the immune response is critical in combating pathogen infections, its over-activation often exacerbates tissue damage initiated by viral invasion [9], [10]. The second response is the up-regulation of host genes, such as protein biosynthetic pathways, that are crucial for sustaining pathogen invasion, replication and evasion [11]. Interestingly, genetically distinct respiratory viruses often modulate common host proteins and biological pathways during infection [1]. For example, many respiratory viruses trigger similar general airway inflammatory responses such as the expression of cytokines interleukin-6 (HUGO gene name IL6), interleukin-8 (IL8) and interleukin-11 (IL11), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF2). These inflammatory responses in turn initiate IgA production, B cell differentiation and T cell stimulation [12]\u2013[16]. As a consequence, diagnosis for specific viral infections is difficult since diverse respiratory viruses cause similar, often indistinguishable patient symptoms [1]. However, because distinct respiratory viruses converge on similar immune responses, opportunities also exist for targeting host proteins and pathways which will potentially affect multiple viral pathogens [17]. Moreover, human targets might be less susceptible to the evolution of drug resistance due to constraints on the virus to find alternative host pathways for its proliferation.",

Furthermore, patients infected by multiple pathogens may have further complications due to drug-drug interactions, cumulative drug toxicities and immune system suppression, as observed during HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infections [18], [19]. Indeed, a study in children under five years showed pervasive clinical occurrences of co-infections involving combinations of RSV, HRV, Paramyxoviridae Parainfluenza Virus, FLU, Coronaviridae SARS-Coronavirus (CORON), Paramyxoviridae Metapneumonia virus (MPNEU), Parvoviridae Human Bocavirus and ADENO [4].

Such knowledge may lead to the identification of novel human genome targets that are shared across multiple viral infections as well as opportunities for re-positioning existing drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases [20]. Several recent studies have generated multiple mRNA microarray gene expression datasets derived from experiments involving the infection of human cell-lines or animal models with one or more of the major respiratory viruses [21]\u2013[23]. Through a systematic analysis of these respiratory virus-human host gene expression datasets, we determined common sets of genes and pathways involved in host responses to viral infections.

In one case, an ADENO dataset (GSE1291 [PMID unpublished]) had less than three samples per treatment group, as did a COX (GSE712 [PMID unpublished]) and a CMV (GSE19345 [24]) dataset. As another example, a CMV dataset (GSE675 [25]) lacked a healthy/control treatment group. Additionally, at least four datasets had some comparison groups that did not fit the filters for inclusion. For instance, an HRV (GSE13396) dataset's original study design was to observe differences in HRV infectivity between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. The asthmatic comparison group data were eliminated from the analysis because of potential difficulties in distinguishing between host inflammatory responses due to viral infections from those associated with chronic asthma. Similarly, a combined FLU, HRV and RSV dataset (GSE17156) contained two main patient groups. One group was classified as developing symptoms after exposure to a single virus under study, while the other group did not develop any symptoms after exposure. Only the group that developed symptoms for each of the three viruses was considered for further analysis and the asymptomatic group was omitted.

Initially, all samples except GSM429279 showed acceptable kernel density (Figure 2a), PCA (Figure 2c), MAD score (Figure S1a) and pair-wise correlation (Figure S1c) plots. The sample GSM429279 was removed because: a) it did not conform to the kernel density of the other samples; b) it fell outside of the Hotelling T2 alpha threshold of 0.05 (represented by the superimposed elliptical on the PCA plot), and; c) it was an outlier in both the MAD score and pair-wise correlation plots. A second QC round was performed, which resulted in a further non-conforming sample, GSM429252, being discarded. Subsequent QC analysis generated acceptable results in kernel density (Figure 2b), PCA (Figure 2d), MAD score (Figure S1b), and pair-wise correlation (Figure S1d), thus this dataset passed our criteria for inclusion in the analysis.",

Of these, thirteen genes, or almost 20% of the original 67 genes, were associated with at least one approved small molecule or protein therapy. There genes were: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), TNF, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), jun proto-oncogene (JUN), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), CCL2, CD86, coagulation factor III (F3), phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2 (NFKB2), Caspase 1 (CASP1), and tubulin beta 3 (TUBB3). A selection of these genes, along with other characteristics to evaluate their potential as drug targets such as involvement in immune response [29]\u2013[31], Jackson Laboratory knock-in/knock-out mouse (JAX) phenotype [32], approved or marketed small molecule drug or protein therapy, and current indications for that drug, are listed in Table 4.

Mimosine (gene target: CCL2) and Glucosamine (gene targets: NFKB2 and MMP9) did not have a current indication, while the interactions of Natalizumab (gene target: ICAM1) and Gallium nitrate (gene target: ILB1) with their gene targets were unclear. Additionally, therapies associated with PTGS2 are cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors which have known side-effect issues thus were not explored further. Therefore, NFKB2, ICAM1 and PTGS2 were excluded from Table 4, leaving ten genes for potential drug repurposing. The potential cases for drug repurposing are discussed more in-depth for four targets; F3, IL1B, TNF and CASP1.",

CD40 signaling is associated with CORON [39], RSV [40], and the general immune response [41]. Interferon gamma (IFNG) signaling is initiated by FLU [42] and RSV [43], while interleukin 1 signaling is stimulated by FLU [42]. As components of the general immune response, interferon and interleukin pathways are activated by infectious agents such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and tuberculosis as well as chronic diseases like Crohn's disease, diabetes, and metastatic melanoma [44], [45]. The overall relationships between the transitory host immunity response launched by pathogenic infections versus that seen in chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases are complex and an intense area of investigation [46]. In addition, there are considerations about subtle shifts in gene function roles in different cell tissue types amongst the various diseases. Thus, we are cautious about any linkages between pathways involved in infections and those of chronic diseases as implied by our analysis without further validation studies.",

However, other ubiquitylation proteins, such as ISG15, are known to play roles in host defense [55], [56]. Associations between influenza infection and neuroinflammation in early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease have been recently suggested [57]\u2013[59]. At least one factor in the progression of Parkinson's disease is the formation of neuotoxic Lewy bodies due to increases in SNCA. Increases in SNCA are believed to be the result of loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 which cause disruptions in the protein's localization and solubility [60]\u2013[62]. Polymorphisms in the gene PARK2 have also been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases such as leprosy, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, although the exact mechanism is still unclear [63], [64]. Jang et al. observed activation of SNCA in mouse nervous tissue long after pathogenic H5N1 FLU infection where the increased levels of SNCA mirror those found in Parkinson's disease [57]. Similarly, recent findings from Rohn and Catlin indicate FLU as a potential causative factor for Parkinson's disease [58]. Indeed, links between FLU and other neurodegenerative diseases have been suggested, and these include seizures, transverse myelitis, expressive aphasia, syncope, encephalitis, neuromyelitis optica, and central nervous system disease in general [65]\u2013[67].",

MMP9 expression is induced by IL1B [84] which, as mentioned above, is an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome [85].

Another caveat is that some proteins are beneficial if up-regulated during initial viral infection but have detrimental effects if over-activated for prolonged periods. Thus determining the desired mechanism and direction of therapeutic intervention requires careful study. Although targeting host-pathogen interactions is a challenging therapeutic approach, there are considerable upside benefits with respect to overcoming pathogen-mediated drug resistance and the capability of treating multiple, co-infecting pathogens. Our study suggests several potential human-host proteins that could be targets of future therapeutics as well as some possible drug candidates for further investigations of repurposing against respiratory virus infections.",

A p-value for each of the 658 pathway maps in the MetaBase were generated for each comparison group using a hypergeometric test [99]. In order for a pathway to be considered enriched, each comparison group must contain pathways that have a p-value <0.01 and occur in >5% of the total studies. The enriched pathway list was ranked by its viral frequency, which is defined by the number of viruses represented by at least one comparison group, and then by the sum of Normalized Viral Expression or NVE for each enriched pathway. The NVE for each pathway was calculated using the number of comparisons containing significant pathways within a virus type relative to the number of comparisons within that virus type. For example, if one out of four FLU comparisons for pathway A were significant, the NVE for FLU would be 1/4. Ranking the pathways in this fashion resulted in a clearer determination of pathways shared across multiple viruses, irrespective of time, strain type, or number of comparison groups.",
