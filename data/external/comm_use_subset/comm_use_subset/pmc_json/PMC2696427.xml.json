However, infectious diseases represent the biggest obstacle to successful development of this business. Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) infection alternatively known as duck virus enteritis (DVE), or duck plague (DP) [2], is one of the most widespread and devastating diseases of waterfowls in the family Anatidae and has severally affected the waterfowl industry since the early 1900s because relatively high mortality could be observed and a wide host range including domestic [3] and wild ducks [4,5], geese and swans of all species as well as other birds like coots are susceptible. Furthermore, serious carcass condemnations and decreased egg production were also observed in affected waterfowls. Like other herpesvirus-induced diseases, AHV-1 infection has latent form and the virus can be persistently shed by birds that recover from the disease [6]. This complicates the control of the disease, particularly under small-holder farming conditions prevalent in China.",

Fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) technique has eliminated the need of sample post-amplification handling required by the conventional PCR assay and has paved the way towards fully automated detection systems now that they usually display very high sensitivity and broad dynamic capacity after optimization [10-12]. Since virus load and proliferation dynamics serve as indispensable indicators of virus-host interaction, antiviral evaluation, active/latent infection [13-15] and guidance for therapeutic intervention, FQ-PCR is therefore of paramount importance by its exquisite virus detection and monitoring ability [16].",

(2) The TaqMan MGB probe contains a quencher dye that does not emit fluorescence within the detectable wavelength range and results in greater accuracy in the measurement.

Titration of infectious virus in cell cultures is usually achieved by the end-point dilution method in cell monolayer. Since titration of the virus load is labor-consuming and requires about 5 days for evaluation of virus-induced CPE, distinguishing between virus-induced CPE and non-specific cell alterations may be difficult, the established real-time PCR assay will be particularly suitable in these studies. In addition, an even more important factor is that the virus from tissues of infected birds is usually not readily adapted to cell culture system during the initial several rounds of propagations [21].",

However, the conventional PCR assays are not sufficient in a variety of clinical situations. They frequently encountered problems including the risk of cross-contamination (leading to false positives) and poor quality of extracts (leading to false negatives). Moreover, the lack of fluorogenic probes in the assay results in relative lower specificity since the amplification and detection of specific PCR products are determined solely by the amplification primers. In this paper, the development of a TaqMan MGB-based real-time PCR by using fluorogenic labels and sensitive signal detection system for detection and quantitation of AHV-1 is described. The optimized FQ-PCR detection system presented in this paper has been designed to address these issues and make it even more applicable for routine diagnostic use with several advantages over conventional PCR.",

This improvement eliminates spectral overlaps with fluorescence emitted by the reporter dye, and results in greater accuracy in the measurement of reporter-specific signals.",

In addition, FQ-PCR reaction and detection is all done in a closed-tube system, the need for post-amplification manipulation is removed since the detection of the PCR products occurs online during real-time PCR amplification, hence greatly reducing the risk of cross-contamination and false positive results. The optimization of the AHV-1 FQ-PCR assay was focused on the concentration of primers and probe and Mg2+. When all these different practical refinements are combined, the final result is a molecular diagnostic method that is not only rapid and reliable, but one that is also easy to perform and applicable to use for testing large numbers of samples since the FQ-PCR presented the benefits of increased speed due to reduced cycle time and remove of post-amplification process, offering considerable labor savings and allowing higher throughput analysis than conventional PCR assays and thus is favorable for the transition of this method from research to routine use in laboratories. This method was preliminarily mentioned in a short report [26] but related details of primers and probe sequence, specificity test, sensitivity test, reproducibility analysis, dynamic range and internal control were unavailable.
