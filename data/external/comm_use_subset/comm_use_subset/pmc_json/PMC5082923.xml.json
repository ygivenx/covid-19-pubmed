However, data regarding the causative microorganisms are still limited. In previous studies, viruses were isolated in 8\u201323% of community-based cases, not frequently enough to conclude that viruses are the main causal agents for acute bronchitis [6]. Macfarlane et al. identified viruses in only 19% of patients, while typical and atypical bacteria were identified in 25.9% and 23.7% of patients, respectively [7]. In other studies, bacteria were detected in sputum samples in 45% of acute bronchitis patients [8, 9]. In addition, several authors suggested that some patients with acute bronchitis had mixed infections involving both viruses and bacteria. However, the exact prevalence and clinical characteristics of mixed infections have not been well studied [10]. Moreover, it is not clear which subgroup of patients with acute bronchitis could benefit from antibiotic treatments. Recent big data from the UK show that antibiotics substantially reduce the risk of pneumonia after acute bronchitis, particularly in elderly people in whom the risk is highest [11].",

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis, and therefore, a wrong diagnosis is possible. Coughing symptom may have almost all respiratory illnesses as a differential diagnosis. However, symptoms such as sputum production, after carefully discriminating from postnasal drip, could also lead to a diagnosis of lower respiratory inflammation. Patients with typical upper respiratory infection (URI) and symptoms of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) during the epidemic period were excluded by participating physicians. We tried to rule out URI by conducting detailed medical interviews, throat examination, and by auscultation. Typically, URI was defined as an infection affecting patients presenting with key symptoms such as sore throat, and nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction, runny nose) with cough. ILI was defined as an abrupt onset of fever with non-productive cough or sore throat [12]. The period of the influenza epidemic was determined by means of a national respiratory virus surveillance system which was broadcast weekly [13]. In some cases, chest radiographs were done at the investigating physician\u2019s discretion, in order to rule out pneumonia. Other exclusion criteria were: 1) history of antibiotic treatment < 7 days before the visit, 2) exacerbation of chronic lung disease within 6 months, 3) active lesion on the chest or paranasal sinus radiographs (when available), 4) immunocompromised status, and 5) confirmed alternative cause for the cough (e.g., drugs [newly started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors], pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or gastro-esophageal reflux). Stable chronic lung disease patients were not excluded.",

First, patients included in such studies were inhomogeneous, and a considerable proportion of them may have had only upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). It is more appropriate to evaluate antibiotic effects in a fully differentiated group of bacterial etiologies. Second, the use of the term \u2018bacterial infection\u2019 in the lower respiratory tract does not necessarily imply that there is a requirement for antibiotics. Many of these infections can be cured without antibiotics [28]. Third, even if bacterial infections were treated using antibiotics, subjective symptoms, such as post-infectious cough or upper-airway cough syndrome, might persist [29]. Interestingly, in a randomized controlled trial of patients with URIs, antibiotics were clinically beneficial for a subgroup whose nasopharyngeal secretions contained respiratory bacteria [30]. Although the presence of bacterial agents does not always indicate a disease, antibiotic treatments might be beneficial in subgroups of patients with bacterial etiologies. C-reactive protein or procalcitonin levels may eventually provide an objective marker for evaluating the need for antibiotic treatment [31].",

Some previous studies found S. pneumoniae to be the most frequent pathogen [7, 26], while others found H. influenzae more frequently [28, 34]. However, with the detection of pneumococcal antigens in sputum or urine, or PCR on airway secretions, S. pneumoniae is found in 17\u201319% of LRTI cases [7, 26]. Because we only used sputum cultures to detect typical bacteria, the incidence of S. pneumoniae might have been underestimated. Interestingly, S. pneumoniae was isolated in older patients twice as commonly than in younger patients (\u226560 vs. <40 years: 15.0% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.075). Therefore, pneumococcal vaccines may be beneficial in preventing acute bronchitis associated with S. pneumoniae in older patients. Additional studies are warranted.",

Several studies have suggested that rhinovirus can be pathogenic for LRTI, but it is unclear whether rhinovirus triggers secondary bacterial infection [36\u201338]. Also, viral-bacterial mixed infections have induced more severe inflammation and disease than individual infections in CAP cases [35, 39, 40]. Clinical features and outcomes have not been studied in patients with mixed infection acute bronchitis or LRTI without pneumonia, and we found no distinct characteristics of mixed infections.",
