For example, the number of norovirus outbreaks reported increased in 2002. It was not clear, however, whether the higher reported numbers were a sign of more outbreaks or more frequent reporting of outbreaks. Case-reporting bias does not affect molecular data, however. So coalescent analysis of molecular data [3] provided a valuable and largely independent line of evidence that the increase in outbreaks was real. Of course, coalescent analysis will have its own biases, and here we examine those that result from host heterogeneity in contact.",

Researchers call the resulting networks contact networks. Contact-network structure necessarily affects the genealogy of any replicating infectious agent that is spreading through a host population. In this paper, we use the term parasite to refer to all such infectious agents, including bacteria and viruses. The genealogy of these parasites must fit inside the tree of infections that forms as the parasite spreads from host to host, and this tree of infections must fit inside the host population's contact network. While more elaborate elements of contact-network structure may be important, we here focus simply on variation in the number of edges coming out of nodes, which corresponds to heterogeneity in contact rates.",

Researchers performing coalescent analyses have considered contact heterogeneity in a variety of other ways. Hughes et al. [7] linked it to the phylogenetic clustering of sequence isolates. Biek et al. [8] mentioned that it may have contributed to changes in an estimation of R\n0 (the expected number of new cases that a single case produces in a susceptible population). Nakano et al. [9] discussed how iatrogenic transmission may have been an important type of transmission in the spread of hepatitis C. Bennett et al. [10] pointed out that population-size estimates from coalescent analyses are more accurately interpreted as ratios of population size to reproductive variance. But researchers have rarely quantitatively considered how contact heterogeneity might be directly influencing the results of their coalescent analyses. Volz et al. [11] did account for contact heterogeneity in their coalescent model with a saturation parameter, but this application does not provide a general illustration of how contact-network structure can affect genealogies.",

First, we build contact networks with different levels of heterogeneity. Then, we simulate the spread of parasites through the networks, generating epidemic dynamics and a genealogy of the parasite with each simulation. Then, we use the BEAST software package [12] to produce Bayesian skyride [13] reconstructions of parasite population dynamics based on the simulated genealogies. We also use the framework of Volz et al. [11] to predict the skyride reconstructions based on the simulated epidemic dynamics. We explain how the contact-network structure affects the epidemic dynamics that, in turn, affect the predicted reconstructions. The close agreement between the predicted skyrides and the skyride reconstructions validates this explanation. We also examine how much of the simulated genealogy the skyride reconstruction requires as input in order to produce a reconstruction that agrees with the theoretical prediction.",

The edges of the network determined the set of possible transmission events; infectious hosts transmitted infection across edges shared with susceptible hosts until the infectious hosts recovered. The number of nodes in the network was kept at 10,000, and the mean degree (degree is the number of edges coming out of a node) was kept at 4. The networks were built to be either regular, meaning that all nodes have the same degree, or with degree distributions sampled from Poisson, exponential, or Pareto distributions. The minimum degree in the Pareto networks was 1. The regular networks served as models with zero heterogeneity, Poisson networks as models with heterogeneity similar to a Poisson process, exponential networks as models with heterogeneity similar to a variety of social networks [14], and Pareto networks (scale-free networks) as models with the extreme levels of heterogeneity that might be found in sexual contact networks [15]. We used the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi algorithm [16] to generate Poisson networks and an edge-shuffling algorithm [17] to generate the regular, exponential, and Pareto networks.",

We drew the time to the next event from an exponential distribution with a rate equal to the sum of the rates of all possible events. We then selected an event with probability proportional to its rate, updated the state of the network accordingly, and drew the time until the next event.

In Figure 3, we see that generation times are at, or quickly reach, a minimum after an epidemic begins and then gradually increase until the epidemic ends. In the regular networks, the decline in the number of susceptible hosts over the course of the epidemic causes this increase to happen. In the other networks, which have hosts of varying degree, infection first moves to the high-degree hosts and then to progressively lower- and lower-degree hosts [26\u201328]. Because the degree of a host determines how much his/her infection increases incidence, this movement of infection from high- to low-degree hosts translates into generation times being at first shorter and then longer in heterogeneous networks relative to regular networks (Figure 3).

Additionally, as is well known by practitioners of phylogenetics, substitution rates set fundamental limits on the amount of phylogenetic information that sequences may contain.

The panels labeled \u201cTime to coalescence\u201d in Figure 3 show that this additional information is most likely to be needed early in the epidemic and when there is a large amount of variance in the contact network. It is then perhaps fortunate that contact-tracing methods are practiced by many health departments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [41, 42], which are thought to have higher contact heterogeneity than airborne diseases [15]. However, we probably need more widespread practice of contact tracing for large genealogies to be assembled. A recent survey of physicians in the United States [43] found that less than one-third of physicians routinely screen patients for STDs and many physicians relied on patients to notify health departments and partners, and similar surveys in other countries [42, 44, 45] likewise indicate that contact tracing is not a routine in general medical care of STDs.",

Contact tracing is also practiced for airborne diseases. It has been used to help contain the SARS-coronavirus outbreak [47], smallpox [48], and tuberculosis [49]. Given that contacts for airborne diseases can be quite transient, it seems that, even with the addition of contact-tracing data, we may generally know less about parasite genealogies for airborne diseases compared to STDs. On the upside, our results suggest that the ability to reconstruct early parts of the epidemic is robust to much pruning of the full genealogy (Figure 1). However, this robustness may depend on our sampling scheme. Using discrete-time simulations, Stack et al. [50] found that the difference between reconstructed prevalence and simulated prevalence depended largely on how the samples were distributed over the course of the epidemic. Also, it is unclear how any of our sampling levels might compare to realistic amounts of contact tracing and molecular data for a specific infectious disease.",

Such discordance is likely to occur when there is relatively little time between transmissions. When there is little time for a mutant to become fixed between transmissions, the order in which alleles at loci of a sequence appear in transmitting inocula (or sequence isolates) need not match the order in which the alleles appeared in the within-host population. Measures of within-host viral load and sequence diversity may be informative of the chance of such discordance. If populations tend to be large and diverse, then sequence data may be useless for reconstructing the recent details of chains of infection but still useful in reconstructing deeper branches in the tree. Sequence data from diverse within-host populations could also be useful in parameter estimation for coalescent models (e.g., [51]) that include the within-host dynamics of the parasite. Two properties that parasites may have that would help increase the chance that infection trees and genealogies match are a low level of diversity in transmitting inocula (i.e., a strong bottleneck effect at transmission) and reduction of diversity in an incubation period that precedes all transmission.",

We have survey data about human sexual-contact networks (e.g., [52, 53]) and survey data about networks of close, but not sexual, human contacts [54\u201356]. Researchers have used field data to construct hypothetical contact networks for wildlife and vector-borne diseases (e.g., [57, 58]), and researchers have also used census data to construct hypothetical contact networks for human diseases (e.g., [59, 60]). It seems likely, however, that in the analysis of real sequence data the heterogeneity of the contact network will be at least as uncertain as disease incidence and prevalence. Thus, estimation of contact heterogeneity may be an important goal of the analysis. We note that previous work (e.g., [61]) has also discussed the potential use of sequence data to estimate contact heterogeneity.",
