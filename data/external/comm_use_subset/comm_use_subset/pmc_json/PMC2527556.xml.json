Use of these scores was not, however mandated. Users could choose to skip the score to obtain antibiotic advice alone. Antibiotic allergy reminders were included. If a user had previously registered an allergy for a patient this was presented, otherwise a reminder was given to check with the patient. Detailed information was included about unusual pathogens to consider, the most appropriate choice of empiric antibiotics, the duration of therapy, and the timing of change from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. Users had access to medical literature via the Internet, along with local interpretation of this literature within the CDSS. Users could browse the CDSS content without logging a patient in, so it could be used as an educational tool as well as providing patient specific advice.

In the case of CAP, experienced clinicians would be expected to vary from the guidelines for valid clinical reasons. It is impossible to separate the effect of the computerised decision support system itself, from the effect of the education sessions, which would have increased awareness of the CAP guideline and its recommendations.
