The peplomers have a globular portion connected by a protein stalk to the transmembrane domain [6]. The globular region is formed by the N-terminal S1 region, whereas the stalk corresponds to the membrane-proximal S2 region, which mediates virus fusion to host cells and adopts a helical structure characteristic of class I virus fusion proteins [7]. Determinants of CoV tropism locate at the S1 region [1], [8], which mediates attachment of CoV particles to cell surface molecules, initiating virus entry into cells and infection. There is considerable variability in receptor usage among the CoVs. Most Alphacoronavirus such as TGEV and HCoV-229E use APN [9], [10], whereas the related HCoV-NL63 uses a distinct cell entry receptor, the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]; SARS-CoV also recognizes the ACE2 receptor [12]. SARS and NL63 CoV bind to common regions of the ACE2 protein, although the structures of their receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are quite distinct [11], [13]. MHV uses the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1a [14]; a recent crystal structure showed that the MHV RBD adopts a galectin-like fold [8]. The use of alternative receptors that confer extended tropism has been described for SARS-CoV, MHV and TGEV [1], [8].",

Peptides and inhibitors that target APN showed a link between this protein and tumor growth and invasion [17], [18]. APN is a target for cancer chemotherapies; drugs that bind this protein have been developed to treat tumors, some of which are in clinical trials [19]. As mentioned above, APN is also a major CoV cell entry receptor [1], [9], [10]. CoV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated with N-linked glycosylations in the APN protein [20].",

The RBD adopts a \u03b2-barrel fold, with a distinct protruding tip engaged in pAPN recognition. The structures show how these porcine Alphacoronavirus recognize its cell entry pAPN receptor and how immune neutralization of these CoVs is achieved by antibody targeting of receptor-binding residues in the S protein.

Antibodies clustered at the Aa (1BB1), Ab (1DE7) and Ac (1AF10 and 6AC3) subsites blocked binding of the soluble SA protein to pAPN (Figure 1D). The SA protein therefore includes the pAPN-binding domain of TGEV and epitopes for site A-neutralizing mAb. We applied X-ray crystallography to S protein variants containing the RBD of the related TGEV and PRCV, and have identified how these Alphacoronavirus bind to the cell surface pAPN and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies.",

The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two antibody-RBD complexes, one of which is shown in Figure 2. Residues Pro507 to Val650 of the TGEV S protein, previously identified as the pAPN-binding domain (Figure 1A) [22], were well defined in the crystal structure. They folded in a single domain structure, the RBD of TGEV (Figure 2A). The RBD adopts a \u03b2-barrel fold formed by two \u03b2-sheets with five \u03b2-strands each (scheme in Figure S1A). N- and C-terminal ends are on the same side of the domain (terminal side), which presumably lies close to other S protein domains; at the opposite side, two \u03b2-turns (\u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24) form the tip of the barrel (Figure 2A), where the mAb binds to the RBD.",

Crystals were obtained only with a mixture of a PRCV S protein (S3H) and the pAPN. Using these crystals, we determined the structure of the PRCV RBD-pAPN complex by molecular replacement using previously solved structures of the TGEV RBD shown in Figure 2 (97% sequence identity) and of the pAPN ectodomain (Materials and Methods and Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystals contained two macromolecular RBD-pAPN complexes (Figure 3A). The PRCV RBD adopts a \u03b2-barrel fold like the TGEV RBD (Figure S1). Each pAPN molecule was engaged by the tip of a single PRCV RBD molecule, which bears two exposed aromatic residues (Tyr and Trp) (Figure 3A, in red), and they bound to a membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain (Figure 3A). The RBD N- and C-terminal ends and the remaining CoV S are also distant from the pAPN, and are unlikely to contact the receptor molecule. Based on a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV S [6], the RBD must be also at the viral-membrane distal side of the S and therefore, the receptor binding edge must be accessible for CoV binding to the APN receptor.",

The pAPN ectodomain is composed of four domains (Figure 3A). Domain I (orange) is made of \u03b2-strands, domain II (yellow) adopts a thermolysin-like fold bearing a zinc ion at the catalytic site, domain III (red) is a small \u03b2-barrel domain, and the C-terminal domain IV (green) is composed of alpha-helices (domain boundaries are shown in Figure S2). The pAPN molecule structure is closely related to that of the human endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 [30], [31] (root-mean-square deviation of 2.3 \u00c5 for 791 residues sharing 33% sequence identity, based on DALI server). Domain II bearing the enzyme active site is the most related domain (47% identity), whereas domain IV is the most distinct (22% identity). The zinc ion is coordinated to conserved residues at the pAPN active site in domain II (Figure S2). The active site conformation is similar to that of other aminopeptidases (Figure S3). The pAPN crystallized in complex with the PRCV RBD had an open conformation [30], [31], [32], in which domain IV was \u223c20\u201325 \u00c5 from domains I and II; this creates a central cavity in which the zinc ion at the catalytic site is highly accessible (Figure 3A).",

Deletion of the pAPN Asn736 glycosylation site also abolished TGEV RBD binding to cell surface-expressed pAPN (Figure 4B). Deletion of the homologous glycan in feline APN similarly prevents cell infection by feline, canine and porcine CoVs, all of which share the glycan-binding Tyr residue in the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn (see below), whereas addition of this glycan to human APN is sufficient to render it a TGEV receptor [20].",

Therefore, TGEV, PRCV, CCoV and FCoV must recognize the APN receptor in similar fashion. In contrast, the receptor-binding loops at the tip appear to have a different conformation from TGEV in the HCoV-229E RBD, which also binds to the APN. In this CoV, the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 region has two Cys, as in HCoV-NL63, and lacks the APN-binding Tyr residue in Alphacoronavirus 1, although it preserves the two Gly residues found in the TGEV \u03b2-turn (Figure 6). The \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 loop in HCoV-229E is markedly shorter than in TGEV, but it also has a Trp residue. Sequence identities between the RBD of TGEV and IBV (Gammacoronavirus) or the Bulbul-CoV (tentative Deltacoronavirus) are relatively large (\u223c25%), and similarities are found mostly in \u03b2-strands and at the RBD C-terminal half (Figure 6). These data indicate a conserved RBD fold between Alphacoronavirus and Gamma- or Deltacoronavirus. There is less sequence similarity between the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus RBD regions (\u223c10%), which correlates with notable structural differences between their RBDs [8], [11], [13]. The RBDs of the SARS and MHV Betacoronavirus adopt folds unrelated to the \u03b2-barrel shown for Alphacoronavirus.",

            "text": "Here we show how a group of CoVs attaches to the cell surface APN metalloprotease for entry into host cells, and how some CoV-neutralizing antibodies prevent infection. The RBD-receptor complex structures determined for Alphacoronavirus indicate that the conformation of the receptor binding edge in the envelope S proteins probably determines their receptor-binding specificity. The CoV that bind APN analyzed here have protruding receptor-binding motifs that engage recessed surfaces on the receptor. This mode of receptor recognition is essentially opposite to that reported for CoV binding to the ACE2 receptor, where recessed receptor-binding motifs in the viral RBD cradle exposed surfaces of the ACE2 ectodomain [11], [13]. In the case of pAPN, an N-linked glycan is also engaged in the virus-receptor interaction. The inherent flexibility of this glycan might facilitate the initial contact of the CoV Tyr residue with APN amino acids, and subsequent virus-receptor interactions could lock the bound Tyr between the glycan and an \u03b1-helix (Figure 3B). The glycan N-linked to Asn736 in pAPN is also conserved in canine and feline APN proteins (Figure S2), as are the viral S protein residues that interact with this glycan in the RBD \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and the \u03b25\u2013\u03b26 regions (Figure 6). This unique glycan-virus interaction must thus be conserved among the different CoVs in the species Alphacoronavirus 1, in accordance with the glycan requirement reported for cell infection by CCoV, FCoV, and TGEV/PRCV [20]. The lack of this glycan in human APN (Figure S2) and the absence of the interacting Tyr residue in the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 region of HCoV-229E RBD (Figure 6) imply distinct virus-APN local contacts in humans. As shown for the Alphacoronavirus 1 group, however, HCoV-229E probably has a protruding receptor-binding edge in the envelope S, responsible for its APN-binding specificity.",

Potent TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, such as the 6AC3 mAb [25], target key APN-binding residues in the S (Figure 7), preventing infection. Data from antibody neutralization-resistant TGEV mar mutants nonetheless show that some substitutions can be accommodated in the receptor-binding region of Alphacoronavirus, which confer the ability to escape immune neutralization, while preserving the receptor-binding affinity necessary for cell entry [24], [26]. Our results thus demonstrate that the receptor-binding region in Alphacoronavirus is under selective pressure from the immune system, as described for other viruses [34], [35], [36], [37]. It is tempting to speculate that immune pressure on exposed receptor-binding residues in the CoV S could lead to conformational changes in receptor-binding edges of CoV RBDs. This would result either in changes in the APN-recognition mode observed with HCoV-229E and TGEV, or in conformational changes in the RBD tip that lead to a receptor specificity switch for cell entry, as observed for HCoV-NL63 [11]. Virus use of recessed binding regions, as for HCoV-NL63, is a well-defined strategy for hiding conserved receptor-binding residues from antibodies [34], [36]. Like HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV uses a recessed, although broader ACE2-binding surface, which can accommodate mutations that permit cross-species receptor recognition [13]. It remains to be understood why, despite major changes in the receptor-binding region, all these CoV use metalloproteases as cell entry receptors.",

Knowledge of the structure is leading to research on the mechanism of action of numerous anti-tumor compounds that target mammalian APN [19]; these studies will be fundamental for improving drug specificity. The detailed view of the APN-CoV interaction shown here might also lead to development of small molecules to block CoV infection.

Three cycles of solvent correction, refinement of individual coordinates and atomic displacement parameters combined with TLS were applied in each step of structure refinement with phenix.refine, which was alternated with manual adjustment of the model to the electron density maps.
