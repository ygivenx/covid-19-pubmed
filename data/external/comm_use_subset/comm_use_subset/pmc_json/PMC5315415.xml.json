Zoonotic diseases have the potential to impact society in three main ways: (1) they threaten the health of animals resulting in illness, loss of productivity, and death; (2) they threaten the livelihood of people dependent on livestock as a major source of income; and (3) they cause illness and death in people, which in turn causes additional economic and societal loss.",

Ethiopia is particularly vulnerable to the effect of zoonotic diseases because the economy is largely dependent on agriculture [7], [8] and roughly 80% of households have direct contact with domestic animals, creating an opportunity for infection and spread of disease [2], [9]. Ethiopia also ranks very high in the health burden of zoonotic diseases and in having a large population of poor livestock keepers [10]. Meanwhile, the lack of coordination among human and animal health sectors coupled with inadequate resources for public health systems have been prominent factors that have contributed to weak surveillance systems and less efficient and ineffective response to public health threats in the country. Therefore, having a mutually agreed and prioritized agenda among key sectors is crucial for resource allocation and strengthening zoonotic disease surveillance systems in the country.",

GHSA is an initiative developed by the US government with other international collaborators to address the gaps that exist in many countries in meeting the International Health Regulations and the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) pathway. GHSA has three strategies \u2014 Predict, Respond, and Prevent \u2014 and eleven packages were developed to achieve the strategies [11]. One of these action packages is addressing the burden of zoonotic diseases. Because a large number of zoonotic diseases endemically occur in Ethiopia, a prioritization process was necessary to identify the most critical zoonotic diseases that should be jointly addressed by animal and human health agencies to maximize impact on the health of people and animals in Ethiopia. The present article describes the first semi-quantitative, multi-sectoral process used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia.",

            "text": "Surveillance and diagnoses of zoonotic diseases requires a One Health approach involving human, animal and environmental sector participation. The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool can foster discussion and collaboration between agencies using both qualitative and quantitative methods for analysis of prioritized diseases. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories for the prioritized zoonotic diseases, establishment of joint outbreak response capacity and sharing of surveillance information by animal and human health authorities, and other intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases. Intersectoral engagement to establish control and prevention strategies for prioritized zoonotic diseases of greatest importance will reduce and eliminate unnecessary morbidity and mortality in humans and animals and reduce the economic impact of the diseases at the national and household levels while at the same time creating intersectoral linkages and infrastructure improvements needed to rapidly respond to newly emerging health threats.",
