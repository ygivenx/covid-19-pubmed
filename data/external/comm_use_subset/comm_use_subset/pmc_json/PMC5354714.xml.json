MERS-CoV was identified in humans for the first time in 2012, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [1] and as of June 2015, more than 1,330 cases and 475 associated deaths had been confirmed (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/archive_updates/en) [2]. A single exported case with travel history in the Middle East has resulted in an ongoing outbreak in the Republic of Korea, while MERS-CoV cases have also been detected in Europe, USA, Asia and Africa. Clinical features of MERS-CoV infection vary from asymptomatic cases to severe lower respiratory tract infection, shock, multiorgan failure which may lead to death [3, 4]. The virus can spread from person-to-person [5] although the rate of transmission appears to be low [6, 7], probably due to the low percentage of respiratory epithelial cells which are truly infected by MERS-CoV and the increased number of viral particles which are likely needed to be inhaled to cause infection [8].",

            "text": "Among the major structural components [1, 9], the spike (S) glycoprotein expressed by MERS-CoV (reviewed in [10]) plays an important role in both viral attachment and entry into the target cell [11]. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein contains 1,353 amino acids and appears as a trimer on the viral membrane surface. The precursor S protein can be cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP4) while the subunit S2 consists of a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two hep-tad repeat regions, termed heptad repeats 1 and 2 and mediates membrane fusion [11\u201314]. MERS-CoV infection is mediated by the binding of viral S glycoprotein to its cognate receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) [11, 15]. DPP4 is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein which is widely expressed on non ciliated bronchial epithelium and in macrophages [12, 16]. Determinants of host range and cellular tropism are located in the RBD region of the S glycoprotein while crystal structure modelling have revealed the amino acid residues in DPP4 receptor which are critically implicated in the S glycoprotein-DPP4 binding [12, 17, 18]. DPP4 receptor is present on different cell types that are infected by the virus, including macrophages. Whether interaction of the S glycoprotein with DPP4 alters macrophage responses remains unknown.",

This virus was unable to replicate and provided a unique tool to define the impact of MERS S glycoprotein and its interaction with DPP4 on THP1 cell activation. Our results showed that MERS CoV S glycoprotein suppressed the production of TNFa and IL-6 and augmented the production of IL-10. At the same time it induced the expression of the negative regulator of TLR signaling IRAK-M and the transcriptional repressor PPAR\u03b3.

Lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein carrying the D510A mutation on the S protein that inhibits its association with its receptor DPP4 were also generated to be used as a negative control. Expression of MERS CoV S protein in supernatants was confirmed by western blot (Figure 1A left panel). Supernatants collected from transfected cells were used after normalization to HIV-1 p24 protein, to infect THP-1 cells or primary monocytes in subsequent experiments. To confirm the presence of the virus and its infectivity, infected cells were harvested, lysed and luciferase activity was measured in the protein lysates (Figure 1A, right panel). The significantly increased viral entry of the viral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV expressing wild-type Spike glycoprotein compared to the D510A mutant Spike protein [17] was successfully confirmed.

THP-1 macrophages, as derived following PMA treatment, were infected with lentiviral particles carrying the wild-type (WT S) or the mutant (D510A) MERS-CoV S protein or were mock-infected. Twenty-four hours post infection, cells were stimulated with LPS and the levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were measured. Exposure of THP-1 macrophages to lentiviral particles expressing the MERS CoV S protein resulted in suppression of LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 production (Figure 1C, 1E). The wild-type MERS-CoV S protein also suppressed basal TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production from THP-1 macrophages (Figure 1B, 1D), even though the levels of IL-6 were approaching the detection limit of the assay. We further assessed whether lentiviral particles expressing the MERS-CoV S protein affect macrophage survival and proliferation. We, thus, performed MTT assay in THP1 macrophages infected with letivirus expressing MERS-CoV S glycoprotein for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The results showed that lentiviral particles expressing the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein did not affect macrophage survival and proliferation, even though a small decrease of proliferation was observed in both mutant and WT S glycoprotein-containg particles due to the infection process (Supplementary Figure S2).",

The same group has shown that macrophages can also be infected by MERS-CoV and in this case infection with the virus induces the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IFN\u03b3 and IL-12, thus initiating anti-viral responses [24] and additional evidence showed increased IFN\u03bb, and several chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and IL-8 production from macrophages or dendritic cells, in the absence [27, 28] or presence [24, 29] of viral replication. Our findings showed that the MERS-CoV S protein did not induce the production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 but was rather capable of suppressing their induction by LPS. This suggests that the induction of these factors observed in earlier studies was due to the active replication of the virus observed, since in that case macrophages were infected with an active virus [24]. Indeed, the induction of the negative regulators of macrophage activation IRAK-M and PPAR\u03b3 occurred 24 hours following exposure to MERS-CoV S protein, suggesting that the virus may exert a pro-inflammatory action at the early stages of infection followed by a state of reduced responsiveness to pro-inflammatory stimuli. This effect was also observed in primary human monocytes, where IRAK-M was induced at both mRNA and protein levels while PPAR\u03b3 induction was observed only at the protein level, potentially due to the heterogeneity of PBMCs, which may mask the effect.",

In addition, expression of IFN\u03b3 was not induced in THP-1 macrophages infected with a lentiviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein (data not shown), further supporting that interaction of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein with DPP4 and initiation of DPP4-dependent signals did not trigger anti-viral responses. Our findings demonstrate suppression of TNF\u03b1 production not only upon LPS stimulation but also at basal levels in THP1 macrophages and primary human monocytes, supporting that MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced a mechanism that affects not only TLR signals but also alternative pathways that control cytokine production. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein also induced the expression of IL-10 from LPS-activated macrophages, supporting an additional mechanism for suppressing immune responses. Thus, our findings support that signaling initiated by MERS-CoV S protein through DPP4 renders macrophages hypo-responsive to activation signals, promoting immune suppression in cells where the virus does not actively proliferate. As a result, suppression of macrophage responses allows viral propagation and suppresses the capacity of the host to respond to the same or other opportunistic infections, thus contributing to the increased mortality of MERS-CoV infected patients.",

IRAK-M is an inactive homolog of IRAK kinases and is known to suppress macrophage activation by TLRs thus rendering them hypo-responsive to pro-inflammatory triggers. Expression levels of IRAK-M highlight their responsiveness and are regulated by various factors including lung surfactants as well as TLR ligands and adipokines [33, 34, 36]. In the present report, we demonstrated that the S glycoprotein of MERS CoV induced the expression of IRAK-M in macrophages, providing a potential molecular mechanism of the suppression of cytokine production. Induction of IRAK-M occurred 24 hours following infection suggesting that MERS S glycoprotein only affected late responses of macrophages, which may provide evidence for immunosuppression observed at later stages of infection.",
