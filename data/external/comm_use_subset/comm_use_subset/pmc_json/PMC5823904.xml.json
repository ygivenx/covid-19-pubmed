As a serine protease, DPP4 cleaves dipeptides from oligopeptides and proteins containing proline/alanine in the penultimate position. DPP4 processes neuropeptides, hormones, cytokines and chemokines leading to their biological activation or inactivation. Potential substrates include incretins (glucagon-like peptide-1 and -2, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), bradykinin, Substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1)2\u20134. In addition to the enzymatic activity, DPP4 has binding sites for adenosine deaminase (ADA)5 and different extracellular matrix proteins like collagen and fibronectin6. DPP4 is also known as cell surface antigen CD26 on T-lymphocytes7,8 and as a receptor for Coronaviruses9.",

Current analgesics are at best moderately effective and associated with intolerable side effects. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic interventions for pain relief is one of the chief challenges for medical sciences. It is well established that altered pain sensations such as hyperalgesia (an increased response to noxious stimuli), allodynia (painful response to normally innocuous stimuli) and spontaneous pain are characteristic features of various pain states12. Previously we have demonstrated dramatic reduction of mechanical hyperalgesia following spinal application of DPP4 inhibitors (IPI and vildagliptin) in subacute inflammation and this action was naloxone reversible suggesting an opioid receptor-mediated effect. None of the inhibitors changed the nociceptive threshold in acute nociceptive tail-flick test13. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of DPP4 inhibitors were also showed in chronic inflammatory models in mice14.",

Although inducing/regulating the endogenous opioid machinery would provide a powerful tool to control pain propagation, this possibility has remained largely unexploited. Here, we identify DPP4 in the spinal dorsal horn, show that its expression changes during pathological conditions, and demonstrate that it shapes opioid signalling in a receptor- and treatment-specific manner. Although synaptic DPP4 may have a key role in neuronal mechanisms of pain propagation, we identify glial cells as inducible DPP4-batteries, in this way playing a role in hyperalgesia and opioid signalling.",

Puncta representing DPP4 were embedded in synaptophysin stained elements suggesting close relationship between synaptic and DPP4 activity in many cases (Fig. 3). DPP4-immunopositive dots that appeared on the surface of MAP2 labelled dendrites were always associated with synaptophysin positivity (Fig. 3a) suggesting that dendrites did not express the enzyme but received synapses from DPP4-containing boutons. The enzyme appeared both in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) immunolabelled excitatory (Fig. 3c) and in vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) positive inhibitory axon terminals (Fig. 3d), as well as in CGRP stained primary afferent boutons (Fig. 3b). DPP4 labelling also occurred in GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 2b) and IBA1-stained microglia cells (Fig. 2c). In naive rats, the density of the enzyme staining was the highest in astrocytes and differed significantly from that in other cell types. DPP4 density was also significantly higher in microglia than in neurons (astrocyte: n = 109, median = 18652.86, 25% at 8185.08, 75% at 31208.90; microglia: n = 83, median = 3196.484, 25% at 2338.702, 75% at 5189.73; neuron: n = 96, median = 343.95, 25% at 247.46, 75% at 420.69; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks, Dunn\u2019s method at P < 0.001). During inflammation, DPP4 expression increased significantly in astocytes but not in microglia and neurons. Significant increase in the DPP4 immunoreactivity appeared only in microglia and significant decrease in neurons in the Seltzer model (astrocyte control: n = 109, median = 18652.86, 25% at 8185.08, 75% at 31208.90, inflammation: n = 112, median = 33379.28, 25% at 7651.47, 75% at 43072.64, Seltzer: n = 80, median = 15583.72, 25% at 8802.54, 75% at 22288.04, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks, Dunn\u2019s method at P < 0.001; microglia control: n = 83, median = 3196.48, 25% at 2338.70, 75% at 5189.76, inflammation: n = 86, median = 2996,71, 25% at 2446.60, 75% at 4359.58, Seltzer: n = 67, median = 4926.80, 25% at 3312.32, 75% at 6493.72, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks, Dunn\u2019s method P < 0.001; neuron control: n = 96, median = 343.95, 25% at 247.46, 75% at 420.69, inflamation: n = 64, median = 312.08, 25% at 203.53, 75% at 416.45, Seltzer: n = 64 median = 278.46, 25% at 213.09, 75% at 362.67, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks, Dunn\u2019s method at P < 0.001, in all cases n means the number of the analysed optical sections of neuronal or glial elements).

DPP4 mRNA was detected in cortical areas in adult na\u00efve animals and its level did not change after cerebral ischemia. In contrast, DPP4 immunoreactivity was not found in the same regions in physiological state but its expression appeared in microglia, neurons and astrocytes in different time points during cerebral ischaemia19. We are first to show that transcripts as well as the protein of DPP4 are detectable in the adult mammalian spinal dorsal horn. Similarly to the effects of ischemic injuries in the brain, our q-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis showed that DPP4 mRNA level was not influenced by inflammation or neuropathy in the spinal dorsal horn. The same treatments, however, caused marked changes of DPP4 protein level in this region. Inflamation caused a five-fold increase in DPP4 protein level suggesting a very potent posttranscriptional control of DPP4 expression during quickly developing inflammation and ischemia in neurons and glia. Our understanding of DPP4 molecular regulation is far from being complete. Studies on lymphocytes have demonstrated that while retinoic acid and interferon administration result in an increase of DPP4 transcription, IL12 upregulates only DPP4 translation and TNF\u03b1 merely decreases the cell surface expression of DPP411,20 suggesting a very complex mechanism of the regulation of DPP4 activity.",

In the other hand, touch sensitivity measured by dynamic plantar aesthesiometry (DPA) in CFA-induced chronic inflammatory model showed no changes following intrathecal application of DPP4 inhibitors, although Randall-Selitto test demonstrated the antihyperalgesic effect (unpublished observation).

In this study, we examined the opioid receptors involved by using selective antagonists against MOR, DOR, and KOR and measuring mechanical hyperalgesia in carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. Surprisingly, the antihyperalgesic effect of the IPI exclusively related to MOR, while vildagliptin affected mainly DOR but had also effect on MOR and KOR. It has been demonstrated previously that IPI does not activate MORs directly23. Both IPI and vildagliptin are inhibitors of the DPP4 but IPI with a penultimate proline is also a substrate of the enzyme and its competitive inhibition is a kinetic artefact24. Although both inhibitors target the active site of the enzyme, the extent of inhibition depends on the residual interaction between drug and active site residues. X-ray crystallography analysing the co-crystal structure of different inhibitors with DPP4 demonstrated that the inhibitors, but not the substrates could bind well beyond the S2 subsite to increase their inhibitory activity25. Taking all these together supports that different residual interactions of the two inhibitors can affect the DPP4 activity in different ways.",

A common feature of these opioids is that they can activate each opioid receptor with different potencies. Since both IPI and vildagliptin are very selective DPP4 inhibitors, it is very unlikely that it has inhibitory effect on opioid degrading enzymes. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that glial cells express opioid receptors and can synthesize endogenous opioids27\u201329. These processes are at least partly regulated by inflammatory mediators including IL-1\u03b228. The interaction between the two systems is mutual, since the endogeneous opioids also have effect on the production of inflammatory mediators released by glial cells30.",

Partial ligation of the sciatic nerve is a model of this pain state resulting in mechanical hyperalgesia together with mechanical and cold allodynia38,39. Although the altered pain sensation is a characteristic feature of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain states, very distinct anatomical and molecular mechanisms, as well as signalling pathways could be activated12. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors were also tested in this model. Both IPI and vildagliptin produced a significant decrease in mechanical hyperalgesia, but this effect was not opioid-dependent. Comparing the extent of the antihyperalgesic effect of DPP4 inhibitors in inflammation and neuropathy may suggest that DPP4 inhibitors are more effective in inflammatory conditions then in neuropatic states. However, it must be emphasized that neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia are very difficult to treat and efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors is comparable to the adjuvant analgesic reference drugs used in the clinical practice in doses not causing sedative side-effect and motor incoordination40. Therefore, this moderate, but significant antihyperalgesic action should indeed be considered remarkable.",

Several models of different types of allodynia and hyperalgesia have been proposed with the common feature that the two phenomena based on different mechanisms12,41\u201344. The major issue is whether the specially designed behaviour tests for mechanical allodynia or mechanical hyperalgesia reflects these phenomena or not. In this study, the threshold-decrease determined with the Randall-Selitto test that applies a basically painful pressure stimulus on the rat hind paw is expected to show mechanical hyperalgesia. The touch stimulus applied by the DPA that utilizes a blunt-end metal needle is considered to be non-painful under intact, normal conditions, therefore its threshold-decrease is expected to reflect mechanical allodynia. Since the spinal application of the two inhibitors, resulted in significant changes in the Randall-Selitto test but not in DPA, our data indicate that the two tests measure two different processes. Therefore, we can conclude that DPP4 inhibitors selectively affect hyperalgesia, but not allodynia. Our results indicate the contribution of the DPP4 to the development and maintenance of mechanical hyperalgesia in this model of neuropathy, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The increased expression of the enzyme was most obvious in microglia suggesting the role of this cell type in this process. The contribution of microglia to the development of allodynia in neuropathic condition is intensively studied45\u201347, but its role in the induction and maintanance of hyperalgesia and its relationship to the DPP4 requires further studies.",

The same optimized parameters were used for all types of sections. IBA1-, GFAP- and DPP4-immunolabellings (for glial cells) or DPP4 immunolabelling with fluorescent Nissl staining (neuronal cell bodies) were imaged in different colour channels sequentially. Outlines of microglia and astrocytes were determined automatically by using the AutoThreshold plugin of ImageJ in IBA1 and GFAP image channels, respectively. To exclude non-specific labelling of glial cells and nuclei by the fluorescent Nissl dye, contours of randomly selected neurons (8 neuron/field) were drawn manually. Then integrated density values from DPP4 image channel were measured in previously delineated glial or neuronal profiles to detect changes in protein expression due to different treatments. The density values were subjected to statistical analysis.",
