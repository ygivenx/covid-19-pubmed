These works demonstrated complex interactions between the host and plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses, the largest group among viruses. (+)RNA viruses contain relatively small genomes and greatly depend on the resources of the infected hosts in many steps during the infection process. These viruses recruit numerous host proteins to facilitate their replication and spread [8], [9], [10]. Many host RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in replication of (+)RNA viruses, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and RNA-modifying enzymes [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. In spite of the extensive effort, the actual function of host factors in (+)RNA virus replication is known only for a small number of host factors [8], [10], [15], [16], [17].",

Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expressing p33 and p92pol replication proteins can efficiently replicate a short TBSV-derived replicon (rep)RNA [20], [21]. The tombusviral repRNA plays several functions, including serving as a template for replication and as a platform for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [19], [22], [23]. The viral RNA also participates in RNA recombination [6], [18], [24], which likely plays a major role in virus evolution.",

Although eEF1A has been shown to be part of replicase complexes of several RNA viruses [16], [34], [35], [36], studies on determining its functions in virus replication are hindered by several major difficulties. These include (i) genetic redundancy: yeast has two eEF1A genes (TEF1 and TEF2), whereas animals and plants have 2\u20137 genes and several isoforms of eEF1A. (ii) eEF1A provides essential functions for cell viability and mutations could have pleiotropic effects on protein translation, actin bundling and apoptosis. (iii) eEF1A is a very abundant protein that constitutes 1\u20135% of total cellular proteins, making it difficult to completely remove eEF1A from biochemical assays using cell extracts. (iv) eEF1A is also required for the translation of viral proteins in infected cells, making it difficult to separate its effect on translation versus replication, processes that are interdependent.",

The obtained data support the model that eEF1A plays several roles during TBSV replication, including facilitating the assembly of the viral replicase complex. Moreover, using in vitro replication assays, we demonstrate that eEF1A enhances minus-strand synthesis via stimulating the initiation step of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Since eEF1A is also associated with several other viral replication proteins or binds to viral RNAs, it is possible that the uncovered functions of eEF1A might be utilized by other RNA viruses during their replication as well.",

In this assay, we used yeast strains, in which the two wt eEF1A genes (TEF1/TEF2) were deleted from the chromosome, while the wt or mutated eEF1A was expressed from plasmids. Importantly, a given eEF1A mutant is the only source of eEF1A in the yeast cells used. Using the high-throughput assay, we identified one yeast strain (N21) expressing an eEF1A mutant that supported reduced TBSV repRNA replication, while the other three strains with eEF1A mutants (named C42, C53 and C62) showed increased level of repRNA accumulation (Fig. 1A and S1B\u2013G). Interestingly, the eEF1A mutants supporting increased steady-state level of repRNA accumulation did not increase the relative level of p33 and p92pol replication proteins (Fig. 1A, bottom panel; S1D\u2013E). Thus, these eEF1A mutants likely affect TBSV replication directly. Accordingly, affinity purification of the solubilized tombusvirus replicase complex from yeast cells, followed by in vitro replicase activity assay revealed that the replicase from C42, C53 and C62 mutant eEF1A-expressing yeast strains had \u223c2-fold increased activities when compared with wt eEF1A-expressing yeast strain (Fig. 1B, lanes 1\u20136 versus 7\u20138). The amounts of replication protein p33 and the co-purified eEF1A were comparable in the purified replicase samples (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), indicating that the differences in replicase activities in the mutants are likely due to enhanced replicase functions, and not due to altered proteins levels in the replicase complexes. Testing the ability of C42, C53 and C62 mutant eEF1As to bind to the viral RNA or to the p33 and p92pol replication proteins in vitro (Fig. S2B\u2013C) did not reveal significant differences between the mutants and the WT. This further supports that these eEF1A mutations likely increase the function of the viral replicase without altering the protein and RNA components in the replicase.",

These yeast extracts contained comparable amount of total proteins as well as the amounts of eEF1A, ALP, PGK and Hsp70 (Ssa) yeast proteins were comparable (Fig. 2A). The advantage of the CFE extracts is that they can then be programmed with the TBSV (+)repRNA in the presence of purified recombinant p33 and p92pol obtained from E. coli that leads to the in vitro assembly of the viral replicase, followed by a single cycle of complete TBSV replication, resulting in both (\u2212)-stranded repRNA and (+)-stranded progeny [31], [52]. Therefore, this assay can uncouple the translation of the viral proteins from viral replication, which are interdependent during (+)RNA virus infections.",

The template specificity of the recombinant TCV RdRp with TBSV RNAs is similar to the closely-related tombusvirus replicase obtained from yeast or infected plants [21], [54], [55], [56]. However, the recombinant TCV RdRp preparation lacks co-purified eEF1A, unlike the yeast or plant-derived tombusvirus replicase preparations, facilitating studies on the role of eEF1A on the template activity of a viral RdRp. When we added the highly purified wt eEF1A to the RdRp assay containing TCV RdRp protein and a TBSV derived (+)RNA template, which is used by the TCV RdRp in vitro to produce the complementary (\u2212)RNA product (Fig. 3A, lanes 3\u20134) [55], we observed a \u223c6-fold increase in (\u2212)RNA synthesis by the TCV RdRp (lanes 11\u201312), while, as expected, we did not detect new (+)RNA progeny (not shown).

Pre-incubation of the purified wt eEF1A with the TCV RdRp prior to the RdRp assay led to a \u223c5-fold increase in in vitro (\u2212)RNA synthesis (Fig. 3A, lanes 9\u201310), while pre-incubation of the purified eEF1A with the TBSV (+)RNA template prior to the RdRp assay led only to a \u223c2-fold increase in (\u2212)RNA products (lanes 7\u20138).

DB inhibits the activity of GTP-bound eEF1A during translation by binding to a pocket in eEF1A involved in the interaction with the aminoacylated tRNA and the nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Balpha [59], [60]. GM has been shown to inhibit the actin bundling function, while it does not inhibit protein translation or GTP binding functions of eEF1A [61]. We found that both DB and GM efficiently inhibited TBSV repRNA replication in the in vitro assay with CFE, which contains the endogenous eEF1A (Fig. 4A). Time-course experiments revealed that the inhibition by DB was the most effective when the inhibitor was added at the beginning or during the first 10\u201315 min of the assay (Fig. 4B, lanes 2\u20135), while GM inhibited the cell-free replication of TBSV repRNA when added not only at the beginning, but up to 40 min after the start of the assay (lanes 12\u201317). It is known that the recruitment of the viral RNA and replication proteins as well as the assembly of the viral replicase complex take place during the first 40\u201360 min in the cell-free assay [31]. Since DB could inhibit translation, we also tested the effect of another translation inhibitor, namely cycloheximide, which did not affect TBSV repRNA replication in our assay (Fig. S3). These data suggest that the inhibition by DB and GM is unlikely through decreased translation in the replication assay. Therefore, the above data are consistent with the model that DB and GM interfere with the assembly of the viral replicase complex in the CFE. Also, GM seems to be a more potent inhibitor of TBSV replication than DB.",

In this assay, first, we only provide ATP and GTP in addition to the replication proteins, the (+)repRNA and CFE, which can support the assembly of the replicase, but cannot perform RNA synthesis due to the lack of CTP and UTP [31]. After 1 hr incubation, once the replicase assembly had taken place, we collected the membrane fraction of the CFE by centrifugation and removed the supernatant containing the unbound p33, p92, repRNA as well as the cytosolic fraction of the CFE. Then we added all four rNTPs (including 32P-labeled UTP) to the membrane fraction of the CFE to allow for RNA synthesis by the pre-assembled replicase complex (second step, Fig. 4C) [31]. Interestingly, adding either DB or GM during the first step resulted in robust inhibition of TBSV repRNA synthesis during the second step of the assay (Fig. 4C, lanes 2\u20133 versus 1), whereas providing the same amount of DB and GM at the beginning of the second step did not result in inhibition of repRNA replication (lanes 4\u20136). These data support a model that DB and GM could inhibit the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex, but not the RNA synthesis by the already assembled replicase.

We found that GM strongly interfered with the binding of eEF1A to the viral RNA in an EMSA assay (Fig. 4D, lanes 3\u20136 versus 2), whereas DB did not affect the binding under the assay conditions (lanes 9\u201312). Since DB binds only weakly to eEF1A in solution, but it binds much more effectively to eEF1A in the presence of GTP and the ribosome [62], we also performed in vitro co-purification experiments. First, 35S-labeled eEF1A was produced in an in vitro translation system (containing ribosome and GTP) and, second, biotin-labeled viral (+)repRNA was added. After short incubation in the absence or presence of various amount of DB, we performed affinity-purification of the viral RNA. Phosphoimaging revealed that eEF1A was co-purified with the viral RNA and the amount of protein co-purified with the viral (+)repRNA was inhibited by increasing amount of DB in the assay (Fig. 4E, compare lane 1 with 2\u20135). This demonstrated that DB inhibits the binding of eEF1A to the viral repRNA. Moreover, both DB and GM interfered with the recruitment of the viral template RNA to the membrane of the CFE containing endogenous eEF1A (Fig. 4F, lanes 5\u20138 versus 3\u20134). On the other hand, DB and GM do not seem to affect the interaction between eEF1A and p33 or p92 replication proteins in vitro (Fig. S4B).

Interestingly, it seems that eEF1A stimulates the RdRp activity directly, since pre-incubation of eEF1A and the RdRp prior to the RdRp assay led to the highest level of stimulation of (\u2212)RNA synthesis (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, pre-incubation of eEF1A with the TBSV-derived template RNA led only to \u223c2-fold increase in RNA synthesis in vitro (Fig. 3A). Analyzing the amount of short abortive RdRp products, which are produced through initiation followed quickly by abortive termination [57], in the in vitro assays revealed that eEF1A strongly enhanced the initiation of minus-strand synthesis (Fig. 3B). Although the actual mechanism of stimulation of RdRp activity by eEF1A is currently unknown, we propose that eEF1A might facilitate the proper and efficient binding of the RdRp to the 3\u2032 terminal sequence of the viral RNA prior to initiation of (\u2212)-strand synthesis (Fig. 5). Accordingly, eEF1A was shown to bind to the so-called replication silencer sequence (RSE) in the 3\u2032-UTR, which is required for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [22], [58]. The binding of eEF1A-RdRp complex to the RSE might assist in placing the RdRp over the 3\u2032-terminal promoter sequence, thus facilitating the initiation of (\u2212)RNA synthesis starting from the 3\u2032-terminal cytosine. Similar function of eEF1A in stimulation of (\u2212)RNA synthesis has been proposed for WNV, based on mutations in the viral RNA within the eEF1A binding sequence that reduced the binding affinity of RNA to eEF1A and inhibited (\u2212)RNA synthesis in infected cells [46].",

The assembly of the viral replicase also depends on steps occurring prior to the actual assembly process, such as selection of the viral template RNA and the recruitment of (+)RNA/protein factors to the sites of assembly. Although our current understanding is rather poor about the factors involved and their functions during replicase assembly, rapid progress is being made in this area due to the development of a new cell-free assay based on yeast CFE [30], [31]. The yeast CFE is capable of assembling the tombusvirus replicase complex in vitro in 40\u201360 min in the presence of recombinant p33/p92pol and the viral (+)repRNA [31], allowing for studies on direct roles of various factors. We find that inhibition of eEF1A activity by either DB or GM also inhibited the assembly of the tombusviral replicase complex based on time-course experiments (Fig. 4B) as well as a direct replicase assembly assay (Fig. 4C). On the contrary, the replicase activity was not inhibited by these compounds after the assembly took place (Fig. 4B\u2013C). It is possible that after the formation of the eEF1A-RdRp-repRNA complex DB or GM are not effective in inhibiting the stimulatory effect of eEF1A on the RNA synthesis by the viral RdRp. Additional in vitro experiments with purified tombusvirus replicase preparations confirmed the lack of inhibition of RNA synthesis by DB or GM (Fig. S4A) on pre-assembled virus replicases.",

The LYS2-based plasmid pRS317-Tet-His92, expressing CNV p92 under the control of Tetracycline-regulatable (Tet) promoter was constructed as follows: the Tet promoter sequence was obtained from pCM189-His92/Tet [73] by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, and CNV p92 coding sequences from pGAD-His92 [7] digested with BamHI and PstI, followed by ligation into pRS317 vector treated with EcoRI and PstI. To generate mutations within TEF1 coding sequence by random mutagenesis, we constructed the TRP1-based plasmid pRS314-pTEF1-TEF1, which expressed TEF1 under the control of its native promoter.

The plasmid pool carrying the randomly mutated TEF1 gene was introduced into the yeast cells already transformed with the two virus expression plasmids by in vivo gap repair mechanism via homologous recombination (Fig. S1A) [75]. Briefly, pRS314-pTEF1-TEF1 was digested with enzymes to truncate the TEF1 coding sequence, and then the digested plasmid was recovered. The gapped plasmid (5\u201310 \u00b5g) was transformed together with overlapping PCR (20 \u00b5g) products carrying the TEF1 mutations created by random mutagenic PCR (see above). The transformed yeast cells were selected on SC media lacking uracil, tryptophan, leucine, histidine and lysine. The colonies were further streaked onto SC media plate lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and lysine (SC-TLHK\u2212) with 0.1% (w/v final) 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA) media to select against the URA3-based wild-type TEF1 plasmid (Fig. S1A). This selection was repeated once and the loss of URA3 plasmid was confirmed by the inability of the yeast strains to grow on uracil-minus media. The yeast cells carrying the randomly mutated TEF1 were grown at 29\u00b0C for 24 h in SC-TLHK\u2212 media with 50 \u00b5M CuSO4 to induce virus replication. Total RNA extraction from yeast cells and Northern blotting and Western blotting were done as previously described [7], [25].",

The supernatant containing extra p33, p92pol and repRNA, which were not bound to the membranes in the cell-free extract, was discarded, while the membrane pellet was re-suspended in a standard in vitro replicase assay buffer containing [32P]-UTP and ATP, CTP, and GTP, and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 h [31].",

            "text": "The TBSV viral RNA gets recruited to the membrane from the soluble fraction with the help of TBSV replication proteins and host factors present in the yeast CFE. The in vitro RNA recruitment reaction was performed according to [31], except that 32P-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA were used and rCTP, rUTP, 32P-labeled UTP, and Actinomycin D were omitted from the reaction. As a negative control, a recruitment-deficient repRNA, termed C99-G mutant, was used (Fig. 4F, lane 2) [23]. This mutant RNA is not recognized by p33/p92 replication proteins and it does not replicate in plants, in yeast or in the CFE in vitro [23], [31], [52], [77]. The RNA recruitment assay results in the assembly of the functional viral replicase, when wt repRNA is used, and nonfunctional replicase when the C99-G mutant is used in the assay (J. Pogany and P.D. Nagy, not shown) [31]. Inhibitors DB and GM were added at final concentration of 150 and 100 \u00b5M, respectively. After two hours of incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of reaction buffer was added to the in vitro assay, followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 35,000\u00d7 g for 1h, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml reaction buffer, followed by centrifugation at 35,000\u00d7 g for 10 min. The membrane-bound repRNA was extracted from the pellet by adding 0.1 ml stop buffer and 0.1 ml phenol/chloroform and vortexing, followed by isopropanol/ammonium acetate precipitation [52]. The RNA samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and phophoimaging as described [52].",

The TBSV (+)RNA template was the short 3\u2032 end region (SL1/SL2/SL3), which contain the promoter region (SL1) for initiation and the replication silencer element (within SL3) that down-regulates initiation. The second template was SL1m with a point mutation within the promoter sequence, which is being used more efficiently by the TCV RdRp in vitro. Note that eEF1A has been shown to bind to the replication silencer element. The RdRp assay had two steps: first, the shown components were incubated at room temperature to facilitate their interaction, followed 5 min latter the addition of the shown component and the ribonucleotides to start RNA synthesis. The RdRp activity in samples containing the template RNA and the RdRp were chosen as 100% (lanes 3\u20134). (B) Detection of abortive RdRp products in the in vitro assay. 15% PAGE/UREA gel was used to resolve the 4\u201310 nt long products produced during initiation followed by rapid termination. Note that abortive RNA products are characteristic products for RNA polymerases that initiate de novo (in the absence of a traditional primer).

The replicase activity in the samples containing the DMSO solvent instead of DB or GM was chosen as 100%. (B) Time course analysis was performed in a cell-free TBSV replicase assay as described in Fig. 2. DB (150 \u00b5M) and GM (100 \u00b5M) were added at various time points and the replicase assay was stopped after 3 hours for each treatment, followed by RNA analysis in a denaturing PAGE gel. The replicase activity in the samples containing DMSO added at the 0 time point was chosen as 100%. (C) A step-wise approach was used to separate the possible effect of DB and GM during either the assembly of the TBSV replicase or RNA synthesis steps. In step 1, the purified recombinant TBSV p33, p92pol and (+)repRNA were added to the whole cell extract in the presence of ATP and GTP, which only supports the assembly of the TBSV replicase, but prevents RNA synthesis. This was followed by removal of the extra amount of p33, p92pol and repRNA, which were not bound to the membranes of cell-free extract, and then by the standard replicase assay in a buffer containing 32P-UTP and ATP, CTP and GTP (step \u201cRNA synthesis\u201d). The denaturing PAGE analysis of the 32P-labeled repRNA products obtained is shown. Note that DB (150 \u00b5M) and GM (100 \u00b5M) were added to the assay either at the beginning (prior to replicase assembly) or after the replicase assembly. See further details in panel B. (D) The effect of DB and GM on binding between the purified eEF1A and 32P-labeled template RNA (SL1/SL2/SL3) based on EMSA. The bound and unbound RNAs are pointed at by arrowheads. GM and DB were applied in the following amounts: 0, 5, 50, 250, and 1000 \u00b5M. Note that the amount of unbound RNA in the absence of eEF1A (lane 1) was chosen as 100%. (E) The inhibitory effect of DB on co-purification of eEF1A with the viral repRNA. WT 35S-labeled eEF1A was produced in a translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate, followed by incubation with biotin-labeled DI-72(+) repRNA in the presence of 0, 50, 150, 500 and 1000 \u00b5M DB. Then the repRNA was captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, followed by elution of the co-purified proteins from the beads. SDS-PAGE analysis shows the amount of co-purified 35S-labeled eEF1A. (F) The inhibitory effect of DB and GM on the template recruitment step in vitro. Purified recombinant p33/p92 and 32P-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA (indicated as W, lanes 1 and 3\u20138) or C99-G mutant (+)repRNA (indicated as M, lane 2) were added to a whole cell extract (CFE) in the presence of DMSO (control), 100 \u00b5M GM or 150 \u00b5M DB, followed by centrifugation/washing to remove the 32P-labeled repRNA that is not bound to the membrane.
