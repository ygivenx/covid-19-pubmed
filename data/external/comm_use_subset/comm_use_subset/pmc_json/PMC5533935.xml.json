            "text": "High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) belong to the seven groups of viruses known to date which have been recognized to be consistently associated with various types of human cancer (1). HPV type 16 (HPV16), the most common oncogenic genotype, is an obligatory intracellular virus which has been extensively studied with regard to its entry mechanisms. While multiple possible receptors have been described, the exact infectious uptake of HPV16 into epithelial cells remains controversial (2, 3). The current 2-step entry model highlights the crucial role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment receptor situated within the plasma membrane or the extracellular matrix via engagement of the HPV major capsid protein L1 (4\u201310). In addition, laminin 332 secreted onto the extracellular matrix by keratinocytes has been proposed as a high-affinity initial attachment molecule (11). Binding to HSPGs induces conformational changes in the icosahedral capsid that facilitate proteolytic cleavage of L1 by the secreted serine protease kallikrein 8 (KLK8) (12). Subsequent interactions of the viral particle with the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B lead to the exposure of the N-terminal portion of the minor capsid protein L2 which contains a conserved consensus cleavage site for the host-encoded extracellular proprotein convertase furin (13). Cleavage of L2 by furin was found to be an indispensable step for HPV infection (14, 15). Although it is now accepted that furin cleavage of L2 plays a critical role for endosomal escape at later stages during the infection process rather than being a prerequisite at the early stages of binding and entry, it nevertheless leads to exposure of a cell surface receptor binding site on L1 (16, 17). This, together with the described changes in virion conformation, is postulated to reduce their affinity for HSPGs, thereby facilitating their transfer to and engagement with a secondary non-HSPG entry receptor(s), culminating in virions that are primed for infectious internalization (9, 18, 19). Interestingly, furin-precleaved viral particles were found to bind directly to the secondary receptor(s), thereby bypassing the necessity of HSPG interaction (20). Several secondary, predominantly L1-specific receptors have been proposed that may mediate infectious uptake, such as \u03b16 integrin (21), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) (22), and tetraspanins (23). Moreover, with the identification of the annexin A2 heterotetramer (AIIt), a multifunctional protein involved in diverse cellular processes (24), an L2-specific receptor has been suggested (25) to regulate entry and intracellular trafficking of the virus (26). However, the precise cellular components mediating HPV uptake into permissive cells remain unknown.",

            "text": "While viral attachment to the host cell is rather quick, internalization of HPV was found to be an unusually slow and asynchronous process (27). Despite contradicting observations due to different experimental systems used to study virus entry, it is assumed that the endocytic uptake of HPV is dependent on actin dynamics but is clathrin, caveolin, cholesterol, and dynamin independent, implying a noncanonical internalization pathway related to macropinocytosis (27, 28). After internalization, the virus traffics through the endosomal system, interacting with sorting nexin 17 in the endosome (29, 30) as well as with retromer components (31) and \u03b3-secretase in the trans-Golgi network (32, 33). In order to initiate infection, the viral genome complexed with L2 needs to escape from the endosomal compartment into the cytoplasm and travel to the nucleus via dynein-mediated transport along microtubules (34, 35). Effective translocation from the endosomes into the cytosol is dependent upon prior furin cleavage of L2 at the cell surface (14, 36, 37), demonstrating again the critical role of furin cleavage in HPV entry.",

            "text": "In an attempt to identify novel host molecules that interact with furin-precleaved (FPC) HPV16 particles at the stage of cell entry, we performed biochemical pulldown experiments and found vimentin expressed at the host cell surface to be a potential candidate modulating viral uptake. Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein and the major IF of mesenchymal cells and cells adapted to tissue culture as well as transformed cell lines (38). Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, IFs are a chemically heterogeneous group of structural proteins (39). Besides its traditionally assigned functions in maintaining the mechanical and structural properties of cells, vimentin also acts as a key organizer in the context of intracellular dynamics and architecture, such as cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell signaling (40). Interestingly, several viruses exploit vimentin during different phases of their life cycle, ranging from viral entry to replication, virus assembly, and egress (39). As one of the major components of the cytoskeleton, vimentin is primarily located in the cytoplasm, especially around the plasma membrane. However, vimentin has also been found to be expressed on the cell surface and in the extracellular space in several cell types (40). While the biological functions of surface-expressed vimentin still remain to be elucidated, an increasing number of reports suggest a conserved role for cell surface vimentin as a component of the attachment and uptake complex of several viruses (41\u201348). Also, bacteria interact with surface vimentin to mediate cellular attachment (49), for example, Escherichia coli and group A streptococci (50, 51), while Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected monocytes are recognized by natural killer cells through surface-expressed vimentin (52).",

In an attempt to biochemically pull down cell surface molecules that interact with and potentially mediate uptake of the virus, we established an experimental system that bypasses the initial extracellular attachment steps necessary for conformational changes that ultimately lead to furin cleavage of L2 and viral uptake. We generated furin-precleaved HPV16 pseudovirions which expectedly contain some (although not all [17]) L2 proteins with proteolytically processed N termini (Fig. 1A). Importantly, no copurifications were visible by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, thereby minimizing the possibility of furin targeting other proteins besides the virus capsids (Fig. 1A).",

Moreover, infection of CHO-K1 wild-type cells also resulted in a more robust (approximately 30-fold) increase of infection in the presence of FPC particles, while neutralization with the HPV16-neutralizing antibody H16.V5 (but not with the HPV18-neutralizing antibody H18.J4) abolished infectious uptake independently of furin pretreatment as expected (53) in both cell types (Fig. 1C).

Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel, allowing visual comparison to appropriate controls (Fig. 2B). Candidate protein bands were excised, processed for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis, and identified using the Matrix Science Database (MSDB) and searching the NCBI database. Among the molecules identified, vimentin received the highest protein significance score, 139, and was considered an attractive candidate involved in HPV recognition and binding due to its involvement in the attachment and uptake of several other viruses and bacteria when expressed at the cell surface (41\u201348, 50\u201352). In order to validate the involvement of pgsD677 cell surface vimentin in FPC HPV16-PsV binding, Western blots based on the immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Fig. 2B were performed. Interestingly, when probing with antibodies raised against different vimentin epitopes (i.e., H84 versus V9), we found that the presence of the viral particles led to a slight reduction in the size of the precipitated vimentin protein (Fig. 2C). No such protein was precipitated in the absence of FPC HPV16-PsVs. Unspecific binding of the vimentin V9 antibody to the HPV16-L1 protein (both being of similar size) was excluded in appropriate control experiments (data not shown). As it is possible that the observed different vimentin fragments were artifacts caused by proteolysis during cell isolation (54, 55), we performed pulldown of the viral particles in a cell-free context in the presence or absence of immobilized recombinant human vimentin protein (Fig. 2D). The purity of the vimentin protein was confirmed by silver staining following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E), thereby excluding virus binding to other molecules besides vimentin. These experiments confirmed that HPV16-PsVs directly interacted with vimentin. Interestingly, this interaction was found to be independent of furin pretreatment of the viral particles.",

The expression pattern of surface vimentin agrees with the literature, as only a small percentage of cells presented detectable vimentin at the surface (Fig. 3A), which appeared polarized (punctate) at the cell membrane (44, 56), with a striking localization of vimentin to filopodia near the substrate (Fig. 3E, column 1). Due to the lack of HSPGs on pgsD677 cells, total binding of the viral particles to the cells was relatively low (Fig. 3C); however, individual cells expressing vimentin at the surface showed impressively high binding of the viral particles, with the majority displaying colocalization with vimentin (Fig. 3E, rows b and c). Generally, increased binding to pgsD677 cells was observed for FPC HPV16-PsVs compared to uncleaved particles (Fig. 3C and E, rows b and c), although levels of colocalization with vimentin were comparable: 85.3% (\u00b120.3%) of FPC HPV16-PsVs and 78.7% (\u00b135.1%) of uncleaved particles, respectively, colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin (Table 1). Interestingly, vimentin surface levels slightly increased over time upon infection with the viral particles; however, furin-precleaved and untreated particles had a comparable effects (Fig. 3B). Although initial (30 min) internalization of FPC HPV16-PsVs was increased compared to untreated particles (Fig. 1E), the two virus preparations were internalized to similar extents over a time course of 24 h (Fig. 3D).",

We therefore set out to confirm our initial observations using three cell lines representing physiologically relevant cell culture models: the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and the human immortalized keratinocyte cell lines HaCaT and NIKS, two of the most widely accepted keratinocyte models for studying HPV infection (57). Unlike other immortalized cell lines, NIKS cells retain cell-type-specific growth requirements and differentiation properties, are nontumorigenic, and are virus free (58). Most importantly, NIKS cells were found to support the complete HPV life cycle (59).",

Unlike for pgsD677 cells (Fig. 3C), binding of HPV16-PsVs to HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells was found to be much higher over the entire cell population as observed by flow cytometry, as attachment of the viral particles to HSPGs at the cell surface could occur (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, binding of untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs occurred at comparable extents for the individual cell systems (Fig. 4B), with HeLa > HaCaT > NIKS. This cell line-specific trend was also reflected at the level of luciferase activity being a readout for infectivity (57) (data not shown), with furin treatment largely increasing infection in the individual cell system (Fig. 1C). However, individual vimentin-positive cells showed comparable particle-binding patterns of both untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs when analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C) in the three cell lines.

We therefore altered vimentin expression in HeLa and NIKS cells by either small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or overexpression. Interestingly, reduced vimentin expression upon knockdown by vimentin-specific siRNA (Fig. 5A and B) led to an increase in HPV16-PsV binding and internalization which was independent of prior furin treatment (Fig. 5C and D). Likewise, infection as measured by luciferase activity was significantly increased when vimentin expression was reduced, which was more pronounced when the particles were not pretreated with furin (Fig. 5C and D). Consistent with the observed increase in viral internalization upon vimentin knockdown, increasing the amount of surface vimentin by transient overexpression (Fig. 6A) significantly decreased HPV16-PsV binding and uptake independently of prior furin treatment (Fig. 6B and C). This was also accompanied by significant decreases in luciferase activity in both cell systems (Fig. 6B and C).",

            "text": "Engagement with host cell surface molecules is one of the initial requirements for a successful viral infection; therefore, targeting viral receptors and identifying novel molecules that prevent receptor engagement by the incoming viral particles are promising strategies for the control of several viral infections. In the case of HPV, it has been assumed that the virions are unable to bind to their entry receptor until they have undergone an HSPG-dependent conformational change and subsequent furin cleavage (8). While HSPGs are expressed at the cell surface and are used by HPV as cellular attachment molecules in vitro, it is assumed that the conformational changes of the HPV capsid required for infection occur HSPG dependently on the basement membrane in vivo prior to the transit of the virions to the host cell surface (7). In order to bypass the need for these extracellular steps, we set up an experimental infection system using the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677 together with furin-precleaved HPV16 pseudovirions (FPC HPV16-PsVs). This model allowed us to biochemically pull down cellular surface molecules that the FPC particles directly interacted with, potentially including the still-elusive non-HSPG secondary entry receptor (20). One of the most promising candidate molecules that was precipitated together with FPC HPV16-PsVs was identified as vimentin, which, in addition to its function as a cytoskeletal filament protein, plays important roles in entry of, infection with, and/or replication of several viruses (39). Although vimentin is primarily expressed intracellularly, we and others observed surface expression on a subpopulation of cultured cells displaying a particular punctuate expression pattern (40). Importantly, several viral pathogens, including picornaviruses, mammalian porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), enterovirus 71, Theiler's virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), use vimentin as a component of their cellular attachment and/or receptor machinery (41\u201346, 48, 60).",

Contrary to our expectation, however, the presence of vimentin was not found to aid in viral internalization but rather functioned as an inhibitory molecule. Both preincubation of the viral particles with soluble recombinant vimentin protein and overexpression of vimentin on the cell surface led to a substantial decrease in viral uptake and infection.

We hypothesize that cell surface vimentin binding to viral particles plays a role in modulating the HPV entry process, possibly by interfering with the binding of the viral particle with the (still unknown) viral binding and uptake molecules. Although novel in the context of HPV infection, extracellular vimentin has been shown to be involved in the response to pathogens through interactions with incoming bacteria and soluble factors, thereby contributing to bacterial killing (54). Similar to the dual role of lectins in virus biology\u2014lectins can be membrane associated or soluble and are known to be involved in either immune defense through neutralization and clearance of viral infection or can be exploited as entry molecules to facilitate viral spread (61)\u2014vimentin may also exert dual effects on viral infection. While surface-expressed vimentin plays a role in the attachment and uptake machinery of several viruses as mentioned above (41\u201346, 48, 60), it appears to interfere with crucial steps in the HPV16 pseudovirus infection process at the level of binding and internalization into epithelial cells, possibly by either masking portions of the virus that interact with its receptor or by causing steric hindrance, thereby destabilizing or preventing receptor-virus interaction necessary for successful infection. Interestingly, vimentin is known to be associated with several integrins, such as \u03b16 integrin (62), which has been proposed as a potential HPV receptor (21) and whose function in HPV uptake might be influenced by the presence of vimentin.",

It is possible that some of the entry steps, including the role of vimentin, differ among HPV serotypes (2, 63). The participation of different receptors and/or modulating molecules can therefore account for differences in pathogenic profiles and differences in cell tropism. It is also interesting that HPV16 pseudovirus binding to recombinant vimentin protein as well as internalization by epithelial cells was little influenced by pretreatment of the viral particles with furin. While furin cleavage of L2 is indispensable for successful infection, as demonstrated on HSPG-deficient pgsD677 cells, the fact that untreated particles still enter the cells confirms the current notion that furin cleavage is important for endosomal escape rather than at the early stages of the infectious entry (14, 15). We therefore propose that the interaction between HPV16-PsVs and vimentin is independent of furin cleavage. Moreover, as the observed binding and internalization behavior of HPV16-PsVs did not greatly differ between the HSPG-expressing cell lines used in this study, we hypothesize that surface vimentin may act as a general viral restriction factor rather than a cell-type-specific one.",

Although the prophylactic vaccines that target certain HPV types show great efficacy (64), they are too costly for general use worldwide, they protect against only a limited number of oncogenic genotypes, and there is limited vaccine efficacy in people already infected by HPV. Clearly, there is a need to identify other modalities and alternative cost-effective means for preventing and/or treating HPV infection. With the identification of vimentin as a viral restriction factor preventing HPV16-PsV infection, approaches in drug design based on molecule structure which can eventually be incorporated into microbicides or lubricants to prevent HPV infection are conceivable (65).",
