            "text": "The discovery of Mimivirus 10 years ago brought in the realization that DNA viruses could overlap with the cellular world in terms of genome size and complexity (1). Many additional members of the Mimiviridae family have then been isolated from various environments (2,3). To date there are seven fully sequenced representatives of the mimiviruses sub-family, all infecting Acanthamoeba, including Mimivirus (1), Mamavirus (2), Moumouvirus (4), Terra1-2 (5), Megavirus chilensis (6) and Megavirus Iba (7). More distant relatives, belonging to the Mimiviridae family, but infecting other unicellular eukaryotes, have also been sequenced, including Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV, (8)), Phaeocystis globosa virus (PgV, (9)) and the Organic lake phycodnaviruses (OLPV1-2, (10)). They all share an AT-rich (>70%) linear DNA genome with size up to 1.26 Mb encoding up to 1120 proteins, which include a full replication and transcription apparatus. Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA viruses (NCLDV) (11) comprise the Iridoviridae and the Phycodnaviridae exhibiting mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic replication stages, and exclusively cytoplasmic viruses such as the Poxviridae and the Asfarviridae in addition to the Mimiviridae. Cytoplasmic NCLDV develop a transitory organelle, the virion factory, where all replication processes take place (12\u201315). The simultaneous delivery from the virion of the fully virally-encoded transcription apparatus together with the genomic DNA, allows the immediate transcription of the early expressed viral genes independently from the host machinery (13,16\u201320). As expected, all the Mimiviridae infecting Acanthamoeba (belonging to the mimiviruses sub-family) share the same transcriptional regulatory elements. This includes a highly conserved promoter element (\u2018AAAATTGA\u2019) associated to the early-expressed genes and a more degenerate promoter element associated with the late-expressed genes (18,21). Their genes also present a unique polyadenylation signal that is defined by a hairpin-forming palindromic motif, not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level, instead of the consensus sequence used by eukaryotes and their viruses (6,18,22). This implies that the most distant members of the mimiviruses sub-family, Mimivirus and M. chilensis, despite their significant differences (encoding 50% orthologous proteins that are 50% identical in average), have in common the machinery responsible for the hairpin recognition and polyadenylation. Accordingly, their genomes exhibit a conserved cluster of three genes (Mimivirus R341-R343 and M. chilensis Mg559-561, Supplementary Figure S1A) encoding a remote homologue of the poxviruses polyA polymerase (PAP), a protein of unknown function, and a predicted dsRNA-specific RNAse III, which could be responsible for the 3\u2032-end maturation of the viral transcripts (Supplementary Figure S1C, steps 5 and 6).",

Canonical PAPs have a tripartite structure involving a N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (NT) catalytic domain, corresponding to the palm domain of polymerases, a central domain, corresponding to the finger domain, and a C-terminal domain corresponding to the RNA binding domain (RBD) (23,24). The only known 3D structure of a non-canonical PAP is that of the mitochondrial PAPD1, which is dimeric and possesses a N-terminal RBD domain (25). The only known structure of a viral PAP is that of Vaccinia virus VP55, and is very different from that of cellular PAPs (26). This structure is nevertheless reminiscent of the non-canonical cellular PAP with a N-terminal domain predicted as the RBD and a central domain corresponding to the catalytic subunit containing the NT domain.",

In addition, polyadenylation in poxviruses requires stretches of uridines at specific positions with respect to the 3\u2032-end of the transcripts (26,29). In vitro, the monomeric Vaccinia virus PAP produces polyA tails as short (\u223cpolyA30) as that of asfarvirus mRNAs (16) while their mRNA polyA tails are much longer (\u223cpolyA300) in vivo. This difference in length is due to the processivity factor VP39, which forms a heterodimer with the VP55 PAP (30). Since a homolog of this processivity factor is encoded by M. chilensis genome (Mg18) but is absent from Mimivirus, we determined the crystallographic structure of their PAPs and performed their enzymatic characterization in the presence and absence of the Mg18 protein. We also identified the minimal machinery required to perform the recognition of the hairpin, its cleavage and the mRNA polyadenylation.",

Strikingly, the corresponding genes are both located right next to a conserved gene (Mimivirus R383 and M. chilensis Mg511) predicted to encode a 2\u2032O methyltransferase (MTase) conserved in all members of the mimiviruses sub-family (Supplementary Figure S1B). Both the mRNA capping enzyme and the predicted 2\u2032O MTase are present in the virion proteomes (14,17) and could thus be responsible for the 5\u2032-end mRNA maturation (Supplementary Figure S1C, steps 1\u20133). An unusual cap modification by an additional MTase (L320, conserved in M. chilensis, Mg584) had also been reported for Mimimivirus, which produces a 2,7-dimethylguanosine DMG cap (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 4, (32)).

Two constructs have been produced for the Mimivirus R341 gene, which was first amplified from Mimivirus genomic DNA. It was cloned using the Gateway system (Invitrogen) in the pDEST17 expression plasmid to be expressed with a N-terminal His6-tag (H6+R341). It was also inserted by restriction/ligation in an \u2018in house\u2019 modified pETDuet expression vectors (Novagen) allowing the expression with a N-terminal His6-Tag (H6c+R341). A human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site allows tag removal. We refer to the Mimivirus and Megavirus PAPs after tag removal as H6c-R341 and H6c-Mg561, respectively. The \u0394D1 mutants lacking residues 1\u201343 were generated through site-directed mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were named \u0394D1 H6c+Mg561 (M. chilensis) and \u0394D1 H6c+R341 (Mimivirus), respectively. Expressions were performed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) by overnight induction at 17\u00b0C with 0.2 mM IPTG after OD600 reached 0.8. The cultures were left overnight at 17\u00b0C. Protein extraction from E. coli cells were performed by sonication. The proteins were purified using HisPur Ni-NTA Column (Pierce) washed with Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl buffer, pH 8.5), and then washed with Buffer A containing 25 mM and 50 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole in Buffer A. After cleavage and purification, the H6c-R341 and \u0394D1 H6c-R341 proteins were dialyzed in CHES 10 mM pH 9 and the H6c-Mg561 and \u0394D1 H6c-Mg561 proteins were dialyzed against Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 9, NaCl 100 mM, prior to concentration using a Amicon-Ultracell 30K centrifugal filter device (Millipore).",

The two proteins were able to synthesize long products, apparently proccessively, derived from the RNA and ATP, in the presence of each cation, demonstrating the intrinsic property of Mg561 and R341 to polyadenylate RNA in absence of any specific signal (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 6). This in turn suggested that in vivo the hairpin recognition and processing could require additional proteins (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 5). In contrast to the Vaccinia and ASFV PAPs which stop after the addition of \u223c30 adenylates (16,48), Mg561 and R341 were able to add much longer polyA tails (up to 700 adenylates). The nucleotide specificity of the PAPs was then assayed in the presence of Mn2+ and the 4 NTPs (Figure 2C). As expected, ATP was by far the most efficient nucleotide for homopolymeric tail synthesis. Similar results were obtained when using Mg2+ instead of Mn2+ (data not shown). However, as observed for non-canonical cellular PAPs known as terminal uridyltransferases (TUTase) or polyU polymerases (PUP) (49), Mg561 was also able to add long polyU tails, although with a reduced activity. This property was also reported for Vaccinia VP55 (29). This enzyme requires uridylates 30\u201340 nt upstream the polymerization site to be able to proceed further. As a consequence, the enzyme terminates polyadenylation after 30\u201340 nt and to add long poly(A) tails VP55 needs its processivity factor VP39 (30).",

No association was observed between Mg18 and R341 confirming the specificity of the interaction. To further investigate the role of Mg18, we tested the Mg561-Mg18 complex in our polyadenylation assay (Figure 2A and B). The presence of Mg18 did not increase the length of the polyA tail nor the polyadenylation velocity, showing that the Mimivirus and M. chilensis enzymes were unaffected by the addition of Mg18, in contrast to eukaryotic and other viral PAPs. Therefore, Mg18 and VP39 are not functionally equivalent and the absence of a Mg18 homolog in Mimivirus has no consequence on the polyadenylation process.",

The dimer structure highlights a large tunnel at the interface between the two monomers. The N-terminal domain (D1) encompasses an extended strand followed by a long helix (\u03b11) bent at the P28 residue (Figures 1 and 3). In each monomer, this helix creates a domain swap, and makes contact with the D4 loop located between \u03b113 and \u03b216 and the \u03b17 helix of the D2 domains of the other monomer to form the dimer structure. In the VP55 structure (PDB: 2GA9, (26)), the equivalent helix (\u03b18, Figure 1B) is making contacts with the D4 (\u03b118 and \u03b216) and the D2 (\u03b115) domains of the same molecule. In Mg561, next to the \u03b11 helix, another proline residue (P44) induces a change in orientation of the main chain, making the first helix of the domain D2 (red) almost perpendicular to the \u03b11 helix. We investigated if VP55 could form a related dimer at the high protein concentration found in crystals by scrutinizing the crystallographic structure of the unliganded monomeric VP55 containing two monomers per asymmetric unit (PDB: 3OWG, (51)). Even using the symmetry related molecules, no occurrences of such a dimer was visible. Reciprocally, none of the symmetry related molecules in the Mg561 and the R341 structure reproduce the dimer found in the VP55 structure. To further characterize the molecular determinants of the dimerization of Mg561 and the role of the dimerization on the polyadenylation activity, we made deletion of the Mg561 (\u0394D1 Mg561) and R341 (\u0394D1 R341) N-terminal domains. Gel filtration experiments revealed that the mutants were monomeric and although they still co-purified with RNA, they were inactive (Figure 4), suggesting that the dimeric state and the N-terminal domain were required for the polyadenylation activity.",

The canonical acidic residues D94-E96-D143 are properly positioned and ordered in the crystal structure as evidenced by the 2Fo-Fc electron density maps contoured at 1\u03c3 on the of M. chilensis and Mimivirus PAP active sites (Supplementary Figure S6A). A water molecule replacing the Mg2+ ion usually found in structures in complex with ATP is used to help locate the active sites in the figures (Figures 3 and 5B, Supplementary Figure S4). The helix-turn motif within the \u03b2 sheet presents a 10-residues longer loop relative to the Vaccinia virus PAP structure. This loop stabilizes the \u03b11 helix of the same monomer in an orientation perpendicular to D2. This domain thus appears equivalent to the catalytic domain of VP55 made of an NT domain extended by one helix (Mg561 \u03b15, VP55 \u03b112), two antiparallel strands (\u03b26-\u03b27) and terminated by two parallel helices (Mg561 \u03b16-\u03b17, VP55 \u03b113-\u03b115).

Two of the three catalytic residues (F286, E288, K342) are replaced by non-canonical residues in D3, and an even longer insertion within the helix-turn motif (37 amino-acids) of the NT-like subdomain is present (Supplementary Figure S2). An equivalent of the \u03b15 helix is also missing. Unexpectedly, the Vaccinia virus PAP D3 domain also follows this topology (C\u03b1-rmsd >5 \u00c5 with Mg561 D2 and \u223c2.5 \u00c5 with Mg561 D3, Supplementary Figure S4, Table S2) but with an extra \u03b2 strand (\u03b28) at the N-terminus of the NT-like subdomain replacing the canonical first helix (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2). In the VP55 structure there is a rotation of 179\u00b0 and a translation of 5 \u00c5 between the two subdomains leading to a C\u03b1-rmsd of \u223c2.6 \u00c5 (Supplementary Figure S4, Table S2). The equivalents of the \u03b110 and \u03b112 helices of the NT domain (\u03b13 and \u03b15 in Mg561) are also missing (Figure 1B). This suggests that despite the lack of sequence homology between the two domains, the D3 domain might have originated from an ancestral duplication of the catalytic domain, a duplication that might be a hallmark of the PAPs of all large DNA viruses.

The interaction with the D3 domain is stabilized by a conserved disulfide bridge (C350-C426) connecting the beginning of the \u03b214 strand and the \u03b216 strand in the D4 domain (Figure 1). The two D4 domains delineate what we defined as the entrance of the central tunnel at the interface of the dimer. This domain is the most basic in both sequences (predicted isoelectric points >10). It is worth noticing that the D5 extension unique to the Mimivirus PAP is disordered in the crystal structure and we thus have no clues on its molecular structure or function.",

RNAs could therefore interact with the PAP through the positively charged grooves and reach the catalytic site through the 10 \u00c5 diameter wide central tunnel making the two catalytic sites accessible for a ssRNA molecule. We refer to this side as the entrance side. The enzyme processivity could be explained by the dimeric state of the PAP which positions and stabilizes the RNA molecule. The superimposition of the catalytic domains of Mg561 with the Vaccinia virus ATP-bound VP55 chain from the VP55-VP39 heterodimer structure (PDB 2GA9) showed that the residues involved in ATP binding were structurally conserved and ordered in the crystal structure as evidenced by the 2Fo-Fc electron density maps contoured at 1\u03c3 on the M. chilensis and Mimivirus active sites (Supplementary Figure S6A). As suggested by the electrostatic potential properties of the molecular surface, the superimposition of one monomer of the Mg561 structure with VP55 in complex with ATP and RNA (PDB 3ERC) seems to confirm that both the ATP and the RNA molecule could bind Mg561 in a similar way to VP55 (Figure 5B) and that the RNA molecule could enter through the central tunnel formed by the dimer (Figure 5C). We thus propose that the highly basic D4 domains assume the RNA binding function performed by VP39 in the VP55-VP39 heterodimer (Supplementary Figure S6B). We also observed that a second tunnel, visible on each side of the central tunnel, led directly to the ATP binding site and could therefore be the entry path for ATP toward the active site (Figure 5D). The processivity factor VP39 binds VP55 at this location and the tunnel is absent in the VP55 structures as well as in its complex with VP39 (2GA9 (26), 3OWG (51)). This major difference, where ATP could flow continuously through this tunnel, could also contribute to the processivity of the mimiviruses PAPs. Interestingly, positively charged residues are lining the central tunnel and are provided by \u03b11A (R24-K32-R35) and \u03b17B (R189-K192-R196) for one side of the tunnel and \u03b11B and \u03b17A for the other (Supplementary Figure S6C). These charged residues are mostly conserved in the mimiviruses sequences (Supplementary Figure S2). They could generate an outlet for the inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) produced during the polymerization reaction, again contributing to the PAPs processivity.",

All transcripts were polyadenylated at their 3\u2032-extremities when using Mg561, R341, or the bacterial PAP used as a control, confirming that other proteins were required for the recognition and processing of the hairpin. The Mimivirus and M. chilensis PAPs belong to a conserved gene cluster predicted to also encode a protein with tandem RNAse III-like domains (R343 in Mimivirus and Mg559 in M. chilensis). Interestingly, the structure of the eukaryotic enzyme Rnt1p, which has a single RNase III domain, in complex with an RNA hairpin (PDB: 4OOG (53)) reveals that Rnt1p recognizes its hairpin substrate as a homodimer, allowing the excision of the hairpin structure. In the Mimivirus and M. chilensis RNAse III-like sequences, the residues involved in the dimer formation, as well as the ones responsible for the dsRNA binding, are conserved and both dsRNA binding domains have predicted isoelectric points > 10 as expected for nucleic acids binding domains. The catalytic as well as the metal binding residues are perfectly conserved in the N-terminal RNAse domain, while the residues involved in metal coordination are not conserved in the second RNAse domain. This suggested that the mimiviruses RNase III-like enzyme, as a momomer with two RNase III-like domains, can recognize the hairpin in the same way than the homodimeric Rnt1p, but is unable to excise it. Instead, it could perform a nick within the hairpin, allowing polyadenylation by the viral PAP inside the hairpin. To validate this hypothesis, we produced the Mimivirus R343 RNAse III-like protein and addressed its enzymatic activity in vitro on a RNA corresponding to the 3\u2032-end of the of the Mimivirus R418 transcripts (Figure 6). Our results showed that R343 was able to cleave this RNA and generate two cleavage products inside the canonical hairpin in a metal-dependent manner. In the presence of Mg2+, a major product of 34nt and a minor one of 51nt were observed while only that of 51nt was observed in the presence of Mn2+. Interestingly, the major product observed in the presence of Mg2+ corresponded to the polyadenylation site previously identified in vivo for this transcript (22), suggesting that Mg2+ was preferentially used by R343 in cell. More importantly, this demonstrated that R343 is the enzyme responsible for the canonical hairpin recognition and its specific cleavage (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 5). The presence of the R341 PAP had no impact on the cleavage. To elucidate if R343 and R341 were sufficient for 3\u2032-end mRNA maturation we incubated sequentially the two enzymes with the Mg592 transcripts and analyzed the polyadenylated products. We also sequenced the corresponding in vivo transcripts extracted from A. castellanii cells infected by M. chilensis. We observed the same polyadenylation site within the hairpin after R343 incubation with Mg2+ or Mn2+ but this site was different from that of the transcripts polyadenylated in vivo (Supplementary Figure S7). This suggested that a third protein could be required to direct the in vivo location of the nick even if we cannot rule out the fact that the Mimivirus and the M. chilensis enzymes could cleave at different sites on the same hairpin and thus the Mg559 protein could produce the same nick in vivo and in vitro on the Mg592 hairpin.",

            "text": "Even though we postulated that a cap specific 2\u2032O MTase is present in the conserved gene cluster encoding the mimiviruses mRNA capping enzyme, we wondered whether the Mg18, like its Vaccinia virus VP39 homologue, could retain the 2\u2032O MTase activity (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 3). Sequence analysis revealed that Mg18 harbors the conserved catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad shared by all known 2\u2032O MTases including that of poxvirus VP39 (33), flavivirus (54), coronavirus (55) and rhabdovirus (56). In the VP39 structure cap recognition is made by the stacking of two aromatic side chains (Y22 and a F180) and hydrogen bonding with two acidic side chains (D182, E233). The first aromatic residue is conserved in the Mg18 sequence (Y59) while the loop bearing the F180 and the D182 residues is 4 amino acids shorter in the Mg18 sequence suggesting that Mg18 may not be as specific for cap residues as VP39 (57). We compared the MTase activities of Mg18, VP39 and the Human N7 MTase (hN7 MTase) on several RNA substrates (Figure 7). First, Mg18 has a much greater activity on the capped GpppAN13 than the uncapped pppAN13, therefore is dependent upon 5\u2032-guanylylation. In contrast to VP39, Mg18 had comparable activity with 7MeGpppAN13 and GpppAN13 and therefore, its activity does not dependent on the cap methylation status. Mg18 is about 10 times less efficient on 2\u2032O-methylated capped RNAs (GpppA2\u2032OMeN13) than on N7-methylated or unmethylated caps (7MeGpppAN13 or GpppAN13), indicating that the methylated residue in GpppA2\u2032OMeN13 is the methylation target. As expected, the addition of Mg561 had no influence on the 5\u2032-GpppA specific Mg18 MTase activity (Supplementary Figure S8). Then we investigated the methylation state of the A. castellanii polyA+ mRNA caps using VP39 and the hN7 MTase. The A. castellanii mRNAs were not methylated by the two MTases, suggesting that their caps were already methylated both at the N7 and at the ribose 2\u2032O positions. To our surprise, Mg18 exhibited a strong MTase activity on the polyadenylated A. castellanii mRNAs (Figure 7), suggesting that Mg18 had a second distinct activity: the expected 5\u2032-GpppA specific 2\u2032O MTase activity, and another cap independent one. To investigate this additional function of Mg18, we assayed Mg18 activity on uncapped homopolymeric poly (A), (U), (C) and (G) substrates. We found an even stronger MTase activity of Mg18 on polyadenylates. In the absence of any cap structure, Mg18 is able to methylate the ribose 2\u2032O position of internal nucleotides with a clear specificity for adenylates suggesting it can also methylate the mRNAs polyA tails (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 7).",

The maturation enhances the translation by increasing the mRNAs stability and their affinity for the ribosome. Viruses infecting eukaryotes have evolved their own strategies to favor their genes expression either by hijacking the host machinery or using virally encoded proteins.

They all share a specific signal governing their transcripts polyadenylation, which correlates with a hairpin structure.

These proteins were not only active, but also intrinsically self-processive, generating >700 nucleotides long polyA tails. To elucidate the molecular basis of this processivity we determined the Mimivirus and M. chilensis PAP crystallographic 3D structures, which revealed two topologically identical subdomains with a nucleotidyltransferase fold. A similar topology is still recognizable in the Vaccinia virus PAP structure and appears conserved in other NCLDVs, suggesting that an ancestral duplication was at the origin of the vPAPs. Surprisingly, the Mimivirus and M. chilensis enzymes are homodimeric and their 3D-structures suggested that the dimer stability depended on the N-terminal domain, the deletion of which lead to monomeric and enzymatically inactive proteins although still able to bind RNA. Thus, while other PAPs form heterodimers with processivity factors, the Mimivirus and M. chilensis PAP become processive upon homodimerization. Since the Mimivirus and M. chilensis PAP add polyA tails at the 3\u2032-end of any mRNA, additional proteins are required to recognize the hairpin structure and cleave it prior polyadenylation. We showed that this role is played by the product of the third gene of the PAP gene cluster, which is able both to recognize and cleave the mRNA, within the hairpin. However, the RNase III-like sequences are lacking the elements acting as a ruler in eukaryotic enzymes (53), defining the precise location of the hairpin cleavage. The R343 enzyme cleavage site in vitro is not the same as in vivo suggesting that another factor is required to achieve the highly specific 3\u2032-end processing of viral transcripts. We hypothesize that the second gene of the cluster (R342 and Mg560) encoding a protein made of a N-terminal basic domain and a C-terminal acidic one, could play the role of the ruler through its specific interaction with the RNAse and the RNA. This would need to be addressed experimentally.",

All members of the mimiviruses sub-family encode a mRNA capping enzyme also performing the N7 methylation of the cap (31) and a cap-specific guanine-N2 methyltransferase, forming a 2,7-dimethylguanosine DMG cap which could favor viral protein synthesis (32). The mRNA capping enzyme genes are located next to genes predicted to encode a 2\u2032O methyltransferase and both proteins are loaded in the virions. Homologs of that predicted 2\u2032O MTase are found in all NCLDVs, including CroV (CroV442) -where it is also loaded in the virion (58)-, PgV (9) and OLPV (10). A 2\u2032O MTase activity was also reported in the virions of Asfarviruses (16). Therefore, both proteins from the mRNA capping cluster could be involved in the mRNA 5\u2032-end maturation. In contrast, the poxviruses exhibit an inactive homologue of this 2\u2032O MTase (D12) the function of which is performed by the dual function VP39 protein (59,60). M. chilensis encodes a homologue of the Vaccinia VP39 factor, the Mg18 protein, which retained the 2\u2032O MTase activity and is also able to internally methylate the mRNAs polyA tails (Supplementary Figure S1C, step 7). The polyA tail synthesis and its internal methylation could thus be performed concomitantly through the interaction between M. chilensis PAP and Mg18. To date, the Flaviviruses NS5 MTase is the only enzyme reported to specifically methylate the internal 2\u2032O adenosines of the viral genomic RNA to increase its stability (61). M. chilensis and the other Mimiviridae able to internally methylate their mRNAs could take advantage of this property. Compared to the host mRNA, the viral mRNA longer polyA tails might allow the viruses to further increase their stability by delaying their degradation in the cytoplasm and thus favor their translation over the host's mRNAs. Since the natural host of M. chilensis is not known, the differences in transcripts maturation observed between Mimivirus and M. chilensis could be the signature of their specificity toward their natural hosts.",

            "text": "The use of a hairpin signal for viral mRNA maturation has been reported for the first time in Mimivirus and is universally used by all mimiviruses (18,22). Their genomes are AT-rich which could explain why they use a structural signal for polyadenylation, instead of the \u2018AATAAA\u2019 canonical sequence which can be randomly found all along the genomes. Some other AT-rich DNA viruses such as the poxviruses present conserved polyuridylate sequences at specific positions with respect to the genes 3\u2032 ends, which are used as termination signals. As a result, there is a very large number of distinct polyadenylated 3\u2032-ends consistent with the absence of a highly specific recognition motif (62). In Mimivirus, the few occurrences where the AATAAA canonical signal is used, its location relative to the transcription end is also much less stringent than for the palindrome structure. Hairpin structures-based processes have been documented in the cellular world for RNA maturation. In the prokaryotic Rho-independent transcription termination process (63), the transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a short G-C-rich hairpin followed by a run of polyuridylates, due to the release of the RNA from the DNA template. In eukaryotes, the histones mRNA maturation also involves short hairpin structures but they are not polyadenylated and the hairpin is formed by endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA (64). Non-coding RNA 3\u2032-end maturation also involves hairpin structures (small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, miRNA in eukaryotes, rRNA in prokaryotes) (65). It is a dimeric RNAse III, which is involved in the hairpin recognition and performs the hairpin excision but the resulting products are not polyadenylated.",

Even if some viral enzymes are reminiscent of cellular ones, the mimiviruses overall machinery is markedly different. Overall, the viral machinery appears less complex than the multiprotein machinery needed for cellular RNA maturation. A single protein is required to both cap the mRNA and methylate them in N7. The 3\u2032-end maturation of transcripts also involves a minimal machinery made of two proteins instead of the five required in eukaryotes. The newly discovered Pithovirus sibericum, a 30 000 years old virus revived from permafrost, although not a member of the Mimiviridae, also possesses an AT-rich genome and obeys the hairpin rule for its transcripts maturation (66). Interestingly, it encodes a RNAse III-like protein suggesting it uses a similar transcripts maturation process.",

Different virus families have independently raised different solutions ranging from ribosomes editing, cellular mRNAs degradation, or stabilization of their own messengers (for review see (67)).
