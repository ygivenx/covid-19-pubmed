            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) is a common gastroenteritis infection worldwide, threatening the cattle production and causing substantial economic losses. Group A bovine rotavirus (BRV) is a causative agent of NCD [1]. Rotavirus belongs to the family of Reoviridae and is a non-enveloped virus; its genome is enclosed in three concentric layers and is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which encode six structural proteins (VP1 to 4 and VP6 to 7) and five nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to 5) [2], [3]. According to the antigenic and genetic variations in the VP6 region, rotavirus can be divided into seven groups designated A\u2013G. Group A BRV, the major viral pathogen for NCD can further be differentiated into 23 G- (glycoprotein) and 32 P- (protease sensitive protein) types, based on the VP7 and VP4 antigens, respectively [4]. Sporadic outbreaks of BRV in China have been reported recently [5]. Although the clinical course following rotavirus infection is typically short, virus can be detected in faeces for up to 3 weeks post-infection [6]. Some diagnostic procedures such as viral culture, RT-PCR and serology have been proved to be useful for detection of the pathogens, nevertheless, the World Health Organization recommends the use of enzyme immunoassays for the diagnosis of rotavirus infections [7].",

In this study, we used the BRV as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library to select ligands to this virus. Because the viruses were harvested from the cells, we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background. Additionally, we gradually increased concentration of Tween 20 to improve the specificity of biopanning. The results showed that the titer of the eluted phages was increased gradually (data not shown). After the last panning, twelve phage clones that were able to bind to BRV were identified by ELISA, in contrast, the control phages had a negligible binding ability to this virus (Figure 1).",

It is clearly important to distinguish BRV from other viruses that might cause multiple infection, therefore, the selected phages were analyzed for their specificities in recognizing BRV and a panel of selected viruses. As shown in Figure 2, the three identified phages were capable of recognizing BRV specifically rather than other control viruses (p<0.01); in contrast, the control phage complex from the phage library had a negligible reaction with these viruses used in this study. As amplification of phage is relatively cheap, the specific phages identified in this study may be specific and inexpensive assay reagents for detection of BRV. Further tests are needed to analyze the utility of the phage-mediated ELISA in detection of BRV from clinical samples.",

Furthermore, the correlation between phage\u2013based ELISA and qPCR was evaluated by determining the area under the ROC-curve (AUC). As shown in Figure 4, the ROC-analysis was very high and comparable AUC-values exceeding 0.9 using either the results of YP, HV or HA as one matrix (the ROC-curve of YP, HV and HA was 0.923, 0.914 and 0.921, respectively). As high values close to 1 of the ROC-curve represent a highly accurate test, the phage-mediated ELISA is a rather sensitive diagnostic approach for BRV. The dependency between GE of qPCR and OD extinction values of the established ELISA was analyzed using Spearman's rank test. For the Spearman test, Spearman's rho of YP, HV and HA was 0.710, 0.695 and 0.707, respectively (p<0.01). This result indicates that a stronger correlation between GE in qPCR and OD in phage\u2013based ELISA. In conclusion, in this study, we for the first time identified the potential ligands to BRV; the phages bearing the peptides to BRV had potential as good diagnostic reagents for development of a novel and sensitive phage-mediated ELISA to detect BRV.",
