The HA proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses harbor multiple basic amino acids at their cleavage site and are activated by furin [4]. In contrast, low pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses contain a mono-basic cleavage site in their HA proteins. Several studies showed that multiple secreted proteases can activate human influenza viruses for infection of cell lines (see [5], [6] for examples and [7] for a review). However, the analysis of cultured human respiratory epithelium demonstrated that influenza virus cleavage activation is a cell-associated process and no evidence for a role of secreted proteases was obtained [8]. Subsequently, the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family member TMPRSS2, a membrane associated protease, was shown to activate HA proteins of diverse human influenza viruses in cell culture [9], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, TMPRSS2 was found to be expressed in human respiratory epithelium positive for alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid [13]. However, the role of TMPRSS2 in influenza virus spread and pathogenesis in the infected host has not yet been studied.",

We focused our analysis on viruses of the H1N1 (including the pandemic 2009 influenza virus) and H3N2 subtypes, since viruses of these subtypes are presently circulating in the human population. Our study shows that deletion of Tmprss2 in knock-out mice strongly limits virus spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection. The deletion of Tmprss2 also reduces body weight loss and mortality after H3N2 infection but to a much lower degree than for H1N1 infected mice.",

Non-infected Tmprss2 knock-out mice did not show a phenotype in the absence of infection, as described previously [14] and RT-PCR analysis of kidney tissue confirmed the absence of full length Tmprss2 transcripts. Upon intranasal infection of mice with mouse-adapted PR8M (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 M\u00fcnster variant, [15]), wild type mice lost weight significantly after infection and 50% of infected mice died, whereas Tmprss2 knock-out mice did not exhibit body weight loss and showed no signs of disease (Figs. 1A; Fig. S1). The same results were obtained after infection with a human isolate of the pandemic HA4 (A/Hamburg/4/2009 H1N1) virus (Figure 1B). Also, after infection with a lethal dose of the more virulent PR8F virus isolate (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 Freiburg variant) all wild-type mice died within seven days post infection whereas no knock-out mice showed symptoms of disease (Figure 1C). Similar results were observed for blood oxygen saturation levels which provide a measurement for lung function. Whereas wild type mice exhibited a significant drop in peripheral blood oxygen saturation that peaked at day 8 post infection (p.i.) with PR8M virus, Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mutant mice showed only a very mild change (Figure 2).",

Furthermore, infected wild type mice showed a strong increase in lung infiltrates and also in the number of infected cells whereas in Tmprss2 knock-out mice a much lower number of infiltrating cells and infected cells were observed (Figure 3 K,L and O,P, respectively).

Thus, if the resistance of Tmprss2 knock-out mice to H1N1 infection was indeed due to lack of HA processing, a virus with a multi-basic cleavage site should spread efficiently and cause disease. To investigate this, we infected mice with SC35M (mouse-adapted A/Seal/Massachusetts/1/80, H7N7) influenza virus which contains a multi-basic HA cleavage site. Mortality and body weight loss in infected Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice were not significantly different compared to wild type and Tmprss2+/\u2212 infected mice (Figure 8), suggesting that the presence of a multi-basic cleavage site renders viral spread and pathogenesis independent of TMPRSS2 expression.",

Additionally, expression of TMPRSS2 in this cell culture system allowed the spread of PR8M and HA4 viruses in a trypsin-independent fashion (Figure S3B). In contrast, spread of mouse-adapted SC35M virus, containing a multi-basic cleavage site did not depend on TMPRSS2 expression [10].

Here, we show for the first time that the deletion of a single protease, TMPRSS2, in mice largely abrogates viral spread and protects animals from severe pathology and death after H1N1 and, to a lower extent, H3N2 influenza virus infection.",

However, an initial increase in viral titers was measured from day 1 to day 2 p.i. whereas at later times p.i. viral titers rapidly decreased. This initial increase in viral titers is expected because the virus used for infections had been produced in embryonated chicken eggs. It therefore carries an activated HA allowing it to enter cells and replicate [19], [20]. In addition, it is conceivable that other proteases besides TMPRSS2 may facilitate low levels of H1 cleavage and allow limited viral spread which is rapidly cleared once the antiviral immune responses have been activated. However, the cleavage activation by such alternative enzymes must be very inefficient since viral titers in H1N1 infected Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice were markedly reduced compared to wild type animals and no weight loss was observed.",

However, body weight loss and mortality were significantly reduced in knock-out mice compared to wild type mice in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, viral load was not significantly lower in mutant mice after infection with 2\u00d7103 FFU. The amino acid sequence in the HA loop which is recognized by proteases differs between HA subtypes H1 and H3 (Figure 9). A recent study demonstrated that different proteases, including TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11d (HAT) and even trypsin, cleave HA from different subtypes and variants with varying efficiency [21]. In addition, ST14 (matriptase) has the capability to cleave HA of particular H1 subtype strains but only minimal cleavage was observed for H2 and H3 [22]. Furthermore, KLK5 and 12 (kallikrein related-peptidase 5 and 12) have been described as host proteases that are capable of cleavage activation of viral H1, H2 and H3 HA in vitro\n[23]. Thus, H3N2 appears to be processed to some extent by TMPRSS2, resulting in the reduced pathology in Tmprss2 knock-out mice but also other proteases are able to cleave H3 hemagglutinin in vivo. Finally, it is noteworthy that Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mutant mice were not protected from infection with an H7N7 virus which contains a multi-basic HA cleavage site and can be activated by ubiquitously expressed proteases [4].",

Broad spectrum protease inhibitors have been shown to inhibit influenza virus in cell culture and in vivo\n[24], [25], [26], [27], [28] but unwanted side effects are a major concern. The results reported here suggest that targeting a single protease, TMPRSS2, may be sufficient to achieve a notable therapeutic benefit against H1N1 influenza viruses and possibly other subtypes. Blocking of TMPRSS2 may not be associated with severe unwanted side effects, since Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice are healthy and do not show any phenotypic alterations in the absence of an infection [14]. Furthermore, TMPRSS2 inhibitors might exert activity against diverse respiratory infections. For example, human metapneumovirus [29], the emerging MERS-coronavirus [30], [31] and SARS-coronavirus [32], [33], [34] can also be activated by TMPRSS2 in cell culture and might use this protease to support their spread in the infected host.

The different virulence of PR8M and PR8F virus isolates has been described before [15]. SC35M (H7N7) was originally derived from the seal, adapted to the mouse by serial passages in the mouse lung [35], and the laboratory strain which was used here was generated by reverse genetics using the plasmid rescue system [36]. Virus stocks of PR8 were prepared by infection of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and for HA4 on MDCK cells as described [37]. Mutant Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice were on a mixed C57BL/6J \u2013 129 background [14]. Animals were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions at the animal facility of the HZI in Braunschweig. Heterozygous mutant mice were interbred and wild type, heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice were genotyped by PCR analysis and then used for infections. Genotyping of Tmprss2 alleles was carried out using a three primer strategy (P1 5\u2032TGTGCCCTTGGACAGATGACTC3\u2032, P2 5\u2032GGACTACAGATATGAGGTGTTC3\u2032, P3 5\u2032AGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAG3\u2032) that allows to distinguish between wild type (yielding a 540 bp product) and knock-out (yielding a 400 bp product) alleles, respectively. Expression plasmids encoding human and mouse proteases TMPRSS2 were published earlier [10], [13]. Previously described expression plasmids for PR8M [38] were used as templates for amplification of the respective coding regions using oligonucleotides PR8-HA-5Acc: GGGGGTACCACCATGAAGGCAAACCTACTGGTCCTG, PR8-HA-3Nhe: GGGCGCTAGCTCAGATGCATATTCTGCACTG. The resulting PCR products were inserted into plasmid pCAGGS using the Acc65I and NheI sites. For cloning of HA4 HA protein, expression plasmid kindly provided by Prof. Klenk [39] was used as templates for amplification of the coding region using oligonucleotides swi09-HA-5Eco: GGGAATTCACCATGAAGGCAATACTAGTAGTTCTGC and swi09-HA-3Xho: GGGCTCGAGTTAAATACATATTCTACACTGTAGAG.
