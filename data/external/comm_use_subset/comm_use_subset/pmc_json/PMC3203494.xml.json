To date, this multiple-wave outbreak pattern, which has also been reported during several other pandemic episodes, remains only partially understood. On one hand, there is evidence from the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic that climate variations and school closing and reopening shape the timing of successive epidemic waves [3]. On the other hand, the explicit reports of individuals experiencing reinfections over a short time interval during pandemic seasons are still poorly understood [4\u20137].",

Notably, a large serological survey conducted during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted host heterogeneity in the efficient development of humoral immunity [9]. This report challenges the assumption that influenza infection confers life-long protection against reinfection by the same strain [10]. From a theoretical perspective, it is possible to fit mathematical models in which individuals can be reinfected by the same strain to multiple-wave outbreaks [11,12]. However, these existing models are rather phenomenological and have been endowed with different biological interpretations, ranging from immune escape by antigenic drift to reinfection by immune deficiency [11,12].",

It has been inhabited since the nineteenth century and in 1971, the 284 islanders were living in the single village of the island: Edinburgh of the Seven Seas (figure 1b). Whereas the internal contacts were typical of close-knit village communities, contacts with the outside world were infrequent and mostly owing to fishing vessels that occasionally took passengers to or from the island. These ships were often the cause of introduction of new diseases into the population [14]. Focusing on influenza, several serological analyses between 1955 and 1963 provide important insights into the immune status of the adults among the 284 islanders present in 1971. Following an epidemic of A/H1N1 in 1954 during which most of the islanders were infected, antibodies to older influenza A and B types were detected in islanders over 20 years of age [15]. In 1961, when the volcano erupted, the island was evacuated to Britain and the islanders were given a polyvalent influenza vaccine that contained an A/H2N2 strain and a recent B strain. Serological studies showed a good response to this inoculation [16]. After the population returned to TdC in 1963, no influenza epidemic had been reported. In this context of a small population with a small and homogeneous immune repertoire against influenza virus, an unusual epidemic occurred in 1971, 3 years after the global emergence of the new subtype A/H3N2.",

Three of them developed acute respiratory disease during the 8 day voyage and the other two presented similar symptoms immediately after landing. Various family gatherings welcomed their disembarkation and in the ensuing days, an epidemic started to spread rapidly throughout the whole island population. After three weeks of propagation, while the epidemic was declining, some islanders developed second attacks and a second peak of cases was recorded. The epidemic faded out after this second wave and lasted a total of 59 days (figure 1a). Among the 284 islanders, 273 (96%) experienced at least one attack and 92 (32%, mainly adults) experienced two attacks. Only a few individuals experienced their single attack during the second epidemic wave. Unfortunately, only 312 of the 365 attacks (85%) are known to within a single day of accuracy and constitute the dataset [13]. A precise description of the clinical features of the illness as well as a review of the secondary infections were provided by Mantle & Tyrrell [13]. The authors reported that 85 per cent of the first attacks were moderate or severe, and this proportion decreased to 50 per cent for the second attacks. Serological analyses of 11 infected individuals demonstrated a high level of antibody against A/H3N2, a subtype to which the population had never previously been exposed. Moreover, seroconversion of individuals infected for the first time during either the first or the second epidemic wave attests that the virus was circulating throughout the epidemic. Unfortunately, no virological analysis was conducted to show whether first and second attacks were due to antigenically differing strains of A/H3N2.",

Although this second hypothesis appeared to them as the only possibility, they were unable to determine whether antigenic changes in the virus had occurred, allowing for second infection, or whether some patients did not acquire an efficient immune protection and either suffered a recrudescence of infection or were reinfected by other patients. We expand upon these possibilities as follows:\n\u2014 Although originally dismissed [13], the first biological hypothesis (subsequently referred as the 2 Virus, or 2Vi, hypothesis) assumes that two separate viral agents, with different transmissibility, were introduced at the beginning of the epidemic.\u2014 The Mutation (Mut) hypothesis assumes that a single initiating virus mutated within an infected host during the first epidemic wave, leading to the emergence of a new antigenic variant [8].\u2014 The All-or-Nothing (AoN) hypothesis assumes that following recovery from infection, some hosts did not develop a long-term protective immunity and remained fully susceptible to reinfection by the same strain [9,11].\u2014 The Partially Protective Immunity (PPI) hypothesis assumes that following recovery from infection, all hosts developed a long-term immunity that is not fully protective but reduces the risk of reinfection by the same strain [12].\u2014 The In-Host (InH) hypothesis assumes that following infection some hosts were unable to completely eliminate the viral load and suffered from an intra-host recrudescence of infection [13].\u2014 The Window-of-reinfection (Win) hypothesis assumes that following recovery, long-term protective immunity can take some time before becoming effective [9], resulting in a time window of susceptibility to reinfection by the same strain.An extensively used epidemiological model for influenza dynamics is of susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013removed (SEIR) form [8,11]. After exposure to the virus, susceptible hosts (S) pass through an exposed state (E) of latent infection, become infective (I) and are finally removed (R) from the infectious pool as they simultaneously recover and acquire permanent immunity. However, our immunological hypotheses motivate a more accurate description of the different stages from infection to development of long-term protective immunity. We incorporate several known [8,11,12,17,18] and novel features to the classical SEIR model in order to mechanistically translate the six biological hypotheses into six stochastic state-space models (see figure 2 and electronic supplementary material, text S1, for further details). Particular emphasis is given to ensure that each model combines enough parsimony to enable parameter inference and enough complexity to match unambiguously to a single hypothesis.\n",

We therefore used the stochastic framework of continuous-time Markov chains that naturally allows demographic stochasticity to be taken into account. The Markov chain events and the transition rates used to simulate the six models are provided in electronic supplementary material, text S1.5. Numerical simulations were performed using the exact algorithm provided by Gillespie [19]. Model-predicted incidence is computed by counting the daily number of new hosts entering the infectious class I. Since the dataset reports only 85 per cent of the total number of attacks and in order to take account of possible unreported asymptomatic cases, the observation process must also be modelled. More precisely, after having checked that the data were not overdispersed (electronic supplementary material, text S1.6), we assumed a Poisson process observation whose reporting rate parameter (\u03c1) was also inferred [20].",

Parameter inference and model selection are based on an iterated filtering procedure that converges to the ML parameter estimate (\u03b8ML) for each model to the incidence data [20]. We performed log-likelihood profiles in order to check convergence to the ML and to calculate 95% confidence intervals for parameter estimates. Finally, we used the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) to select the model that best explains the data: AICci = \u22122l(\u03b8ML|Hi) + 2k + 2k(k + 1)/(T \u2212 k \u2212 1), where k is the number of estimated parameters plus initial conditions, T = 59 is the number of observations and l(\u03b8ML|Hi) = log \u2112(\u03b8ML|Hi) is the maximized log likelihood. This correction accounts for the small sample size relative to the number of parameters (T/k < 10). Finally, we decomposed the maximized log likelihood of each model into conditional log likelihoods log P(yt|y1:t\u22121, \u03b8ML, Hi) in order to compare the six models at successive observation times t (see electronic supplementary material, text S2, for further details on the inference framework).",

The rescaled AICc values, presented in figure 3, allow for an immediate ranking of the competing models and show that the Win mechanism best explains the data. Following the rough rule of thumb of Burnham & Anderson [22], the AoN hypothesis also receives substantial support (\u0394AICc \u2264 2). In contrast, the 2Vi and Mut models have considerably less support (\u0394AICc > 7), whereas the InH and PPI models have essentially no support (\u0394AICc \u2273 10). This rule of thumb has proved to be efficient in many practical situations [22,23] and can formally be justified by computing the evidence ratio of each competing model (electronic supplementary material, text S3).

Second, to investigate whether the differences in AICc correspond to visible, practically significant differences in reproducing the characteristic second wave, we performed predictive checks by simulating 105 time series under each ML-fitted model. Comparison of the behaviour of the best model (Win) with each competitor reveals superimposed dynamics with the AoN model and confirms that the dynamics of the four other models are different with respect to the second epidemic wave (figure 4a\u2013e, upper panels). Furthermore, figure 4f shows that the extinction probability increases rapidly at the end of the first wave for the 2Vi, Mut and PPI models, whereas the Win and AoN models appear to be much more robust to stochastic extinctions during the inter-wave period. In the electronic supplementary material, text S4, we supplement a suite of statistical analyses to evaluate and compare the goodness of fit of these predictive simulations to the characteristic second-wave infection dynamics. Overall, these analyses support the view that, out of the models considered, the Win and AoN models explain the observed time series significantly better.\n",

R0 estimates are similar for the Mut, AoN and Win models (around 10), slightly lower for the PPI model, but more than twice as high for the InH model owing to an identifiability issue (electronic supplementary material, text S8). Overall, these high values for R0 are somewhat unusual: R0 is typically estimated around 2 for influenza, although exceptional cases have also been reported in closed populations [27]. We contend that a high value of R0 as well as rapid spread (the first peak was reached after only 6 days) and a high attack rate (96%) can be expected in small, isolated communities [28] without pre-existing immunity [29]. Furthermore, estimates of the effective reproductive number from the TdC incidence time series [30] are in agreement with our estimates of R0 (electronic supplementary material, text S9).",

The innate response is the first to be activated and plays a key role through its ability to control early viral replication and to promote and regulate the virus-specific adaptive immune response [33]. Cytokines are among the most important bridges between the innate and adaptive responses to influenza [35]. The adaptive response itself may be broken into two critical sub-components: (i) the cellular immune response by which antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) eliminate infected cells and thus prevent viral release, and (ii) the humoral immune response by which serum antibodies efficiently neutralize the virus (both of which are promoted by T-cell help [34]). Antibodies can remain detectable for years after infection and prevent reinfection by the same strain as well as by sufficiently cross-reactive variants [36]. Genetic variation in any of these immune components might determine whether or how rapidly an individual develops protective immunity following primary influenza infection (in keeping with the AoN or Win hypotheses, respectively).",

The primary CTL response is detectable in blood after 6\u201314 days whereas the neutralizing antibody response peaks at four to six weeks [38]. Critically, the CTL response is downregulated after viral clearance [37], disappears by day 21 post-infection [38] and is followed by a state of immunological \u2018memory\u2019 with antigen-specific T cells. The memory cells cannot prevent reinfection as well as specific antibodies could, but they can reduce the severity of the disease [37]. Together, these elements support the Win hypothesis: our parameter estimates indicate that the reinfection window occurred 17.8 days (s.d. 6.4 days) post-infection and lasted for 4.8 days (s.d. 4.8 days). This timing of susceptibility is in good agreement with the interval between the completion of CTL contraction and the full development of the neutralizing antibody response.

For example, the amount of virus in the lung determines the multiplicity of infection of innate antigen-presenting cells, which in turn affects their ability to induce subsequent adaptive responses [33]. Additionally, the rate at which immunity to reinfection develops is likely to interact with exposure rates to determine susceptibility. For example, when force of infection is high (as on TdC), many hosts are likely to be re-exposed to virus before their window of susceptibility to reinfection closes. If force of infection is low, then most hosts will have closed that window before re-exposure (electronic supplementary material, text S7).",

We translated these hypotheses unambiguously into six mechanistic stochastic models, and employed a rigorous statistical framework based on ML [20] for parameter inference and model selection. In addition, we performed complementary statistical analyses, based on extensive simulations, to evaluate and compare the goodness of fit of the predictions of our six models. Our findings emphasize that a stochastic formulation is essential to capture demographic stochasticity induced by small populations [24] and/or low-prevalence inter-wave periods. We show that two mechanisms\u2014both invoking host heterogeneity rather than viral heterogeneity\u2014are significantly better supported by the data. Both mechanisms challenge the efficiency of the human immune response following primary influenza infection, indicating that, after a first attack, some individuals with delayed (Win) or deficient (AoN) humoral immune response could be reinfected by the same strain.",

We advocate application of state-of-the-art virological and immunological methods to samples from such cases. Alternatively, both parameter estimates and immunological support for the Win model indicate that successive infections by the same strain spaced over more than four to six weeks can only be explained by the AoN mechanism. We advocate application of our statistical approach to other multiple-wave datasets that occurred on a longer time scale than that of 1971's epidemic on TdC.

            "text": "Finally, our results advocate a better account of host heterogeneity in the analysis of multiple-wave outbreaks. In particular, studies assuming that the immune response always provides a long-term humoral protection should overestimate the amount of immune escape required to sequential influenza variants to cause rapid reinfection [6] and multiple-wave outbreaks [8]. Put another way, our results may have important implications in the current context of influenza post-pandemic. Notably, the AoN mechanism, in addition to antigenic drift and compensatory mutations, would contribute to break population herd immunity by increasing the effective reproduction number of subsequent 2009 H1N1 influenza variants (electronic supplementary material, text S7). If empirically validated, these novel interactions should be included in epidemiological models aimed at pandemic planning and real-time risk prediction for influenza.",

            "text": "Figure 2.: The six models with six different reinfection mechanisms can be retrieved by adding to three common skeletons (in black) the transitions corresponding to the indicated colour. All models have five epidemiological states in common: susceptible (S), exposed (E), clinically ill and infectious (I), temporarily removed from the transmission process (R) and protected in the long-term against reinfection by the same strain (L). To improve biological realism, durations of the states E, I and R are all gamma-distributed (electronic supplementary material, text S1.1). (a) The 2Vi (blue) and Mut (red) models implement a widely used history-based formalism [17,18] with (i,j) \u03b5 {1,2}2 and i \u2260 j. Upper index stands for the infective strain, bottom index for the already-immunized strain, \u03bbi = \u03b2i(Ii + Iji)/N is the force of infection of strain i and both strains are supposed to have the same mean latent, infective and temporary removed periods (electronic supplementary material, text S1.2). Hosts recovered from strain i enter the Li class and become completely protected against reinfection by strain i while remaining susceptible to the other circulating strain j. For the Mut model, the two strains are supposed to have the same transmissibility (\u03b21 = \u03b22, see electronic supplementary material, text S1.2) and to interact through a cross-immunity parameter \u03c3 \u03b5 [0,1] that acts by reducing the susceptibility to the other strain (electronic supplementary material, text S1.3). The dashed red arrow indicates that at time Tmut if I1> 0, one infectious host with the initial strain (i = 1) becomes infectious with the mutated strain (j = 2). (b,c) For the AoN, PPI, InH and Win models, \u03bb = \u03b2I/N is the force of infection of the single strain. In the AoN model (red), we assume that hosts acquire full protection against reinfection with probability \u03b1, otherwise they re-enter the S class. In the PPI model (blue), we assume that all hosts develop long-term immunity that partially reduces the level of susceptibility through a protection factor \u03c3 \u03b5 [0,1]. In the InH model (green), we assume that infected hosts are able to clear the viral load with probability \u03b1, otherwise they suffer from an intra-host reinfection and, after some time, re-enter the I state. In the Win model (c), we assume host heterogeneity in the waiting time for acquisition of a completely protective immunity [9]: if some hosts re-enter the transmission process before protection is effective, they fall into a time window of susceptibility to reinfection (W). We simply assume that all hosts remain in the W state for a duration that is exponentially distributed: this distribution has a positive density in zero, thus enabling some hosts to immediately enter the L class (electronic supplementary material, text S1.4). Parameter descriptions can be found in figure 3. The transition rates to simulate the six stochastic models are provided in electronic supplementary material, text S1.5.",

For each model and associated ML parameter set, the mean predicted incidence (solid line) and corresponding 95% confidence envelope owing to demographic stochasticity and observation error (shaded area) were computed over 105 stochastic simulations by conditioning on occurrence of the second epidemic wave (electronic supplementary material, text S4). Note that the dynamics of the Win and AoN models are superimposed (a). For the Mut model (c), emergence time of the second variant (Tmut) is indicated on the x-axis. (a\u2013e, lower panels) Quantitative comparison of the conditional log likelihoods for each observation time t: CLLt = log(P(yt|y1:t\u22121, \u03b8ML, Hi ), where y1:T is the daily incidence dataset and \u03b8ML is the ML parameter set of a given model Hi. Absolute differences (|\u0394CCLt|, blue and red bars, left axis) allow quantitative identification of the parts of the time series where the Win model is better than the competing model Hi (Win > Hi). Similarly, evolution of the absolute cumulative differences (|\u2211i=1t \u0394CCLi|, black line, right axis) indicates that the Win model performs always better than the competing model, at least after the second epidemic wave has begun.
