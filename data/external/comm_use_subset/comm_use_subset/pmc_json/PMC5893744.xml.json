ND is listed by the World Health Organization for Animals (OIE) as a vitally important pathogen for avian species and products, in which NDV detection in a specific geographical location often leads to trade restrictions and embargoes (1). NDV was previously synonymous with avian paramyxovirus type 1 (2); however, due to changes in taxonomy is now referred to as avian avulavirus (3). NDV is an enveloped virus containing a single-stranded, negative-sense, non-segmented RNA genome that is approximately 15,000 nucleotides in length. Six structural proteins are encoded, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein, phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M) protein, fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, large (L) protein, and two non-structural V and W proteins (2). Strains of NDV are grouped into virulent (velogenic), intermediate (mesogenic), and non-virulent or low virulent (lentogenic) on the basis of the clinical signs seen in infected chickens (2).",

M1 macrophages play a vital role in virus clearance and host immune responses, but excess inflammation is harmful to tissues and organs (22). By contrast, M2 cells contribute a major role in protecting tissues and organs. The M1/M2 responses from virus infection must be balanced by inhibitory and regulatory effector mechanisms to protect bystander cell, tissue and organ damage from the effects of excess inflammation, preserve oxygenation, and promote host tissue and organ repair after viral clearance (22\u201325). As their mammalian counterpart, plasticity also is a hallmark of chicken macrophages, and in response to microenvironment signals, including microbial infection and pathogenesis of infectious diseases (26\u201336), these cells undergo different forms of polarized activation, the extremes of which may called pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages and anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages.",

Recognition of viral nucleic acids triggers the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) that induce macrophages into an antiviral state and activate immunoregulatory functions in nearby cells. A subset of pattern recognition receptors includes toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induces intracellular signals responsible for the activation of genes that encode for pro-/anti- (M1-/M2-like) inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, anti-microbial peptides, and anti-apoptotic factors (28, 37, 39). There is a total of 13 known TLRs in mammals (TLR1\u201313), with each TLR recognizing and responding to different pathogen components (40). In birds, a total of 10 TLRs have been identified and include two isoforms each of TLR1 and TLR2, which detect triacylated, and diacylated lipopeptides. TLR3, 4, 5, and 7 detect dsRNA, LPS, flagellin, and ssRNA, respectively. TLR15 has been shown to recognize yeast proteases while TLR21, a functional homolog of mammalian TLR9, detects dsDNA (41). TLR3, 7, and 21 are located in the cytoplasm, while TLR1, 2, 4, 5, and 15 are located on the cell surface (42). Previous data demonstrated that chicken origin TLR7 can exert specific abilities against viral and bacterial infectious diseases of birds, such as avian influenza (37) and Salmonella (43).",

Although most reliable markers for mammalian macro-phage polarized activation are not available for chicken macrophages, chicken macrophages are similar to their mammalian counterparts since they have the capacity to change their pheno-type in response to the microenvironmental signals (35, 48). However, whether NDV has the capacity to change chicken macrophage phenotype during viral infection mainly depends on the virulence and genotypes of virus. The specifics of this phenomenon and underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear.",

Subsequent to infection, viral genome load and genes of target expression levels in the cells were detected by qPCR, as well as the virus titer in the supernatants was measured using a micro-HA method. For viral infection efficiency detection, HD11 cells were planted into a 6-well cell culture plate containing sterile coverslips at a viable cell density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per cell for 8 h.

While no differences in replication kinetics were observed between the two lentogenic NDV strains from 24 to 72 hpi, NDV strain LaSota presented a reduced ability to replicate in chicken macrophages (HD11) at 4 and 12 hpi, as evidenced by lower viral genomic RNA loads, when compared with the lentogenic NDV strain F55 (Figure 2A). In contrast with two lentogenic viruses, virulent NDV strain NA-1 presented a marked decrease in the viral RNA amount in macrophages by 12 hpi (Figure 2A), followed by a sharp increase from 24 hpi to a peak at 72 hpi, as evidenced by significant differences in replication kinetics between the virulent strain and lentogenic strains (Figure 2).

However, the expression pattern of these M1- and M2-like associated genes was found to be different between cells infected with the two lentogenic viruses. Specifically, M1-like associated gene IL-1\u03b2 was significantly increased in cells after class II strain LaSota infection, whereas M2-like associated gene IL-10 was only upregulated in class I strain F55-infected cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore, a higher concentration of nitrite in the supernatant was only found in virulent strain NA-1-infected cells (Figure 3B). Therefore, virulent NDV infection can polarize chicken macrophages into the M1-/M2-like mixed phenotype, but the lentogenic viruses induced much more moderate polarized activation status according to their genotypes: lentogenic class II NDV infection induces a mild M1-like phenotype and lentogenic class I NDV infection causes a mild M2-like phenotype.",

As depicted in Figure 6A, loxoribine pretreatment induced a significant increase in M1-like gene (iNOS, except IL-1\u03b2) and M2-like genes (IL-10 and PPAR-\u03b3) in two lentogenic NDV-infected and -uninfected cells compared to the respective untreated cells. By contrast, loxoribine pretreatment resulted in a sharp decline in both M1- and M2-like genes in virulent NDV-infected cells compared to the respective untreated cells (Figure 6A), as evidenced by the concentration of nitrite in the supernatants (Figure 6B). Next, we determined that loxoribine pretreatment whether resulted in a sharp decrease in the growth of the virulent strain rather than the two lentogenic strains through inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. As expected, after pretreatment of HD11 cells with 1 mM loxoribine for 6 h, the expression levels of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) were significantly decreased in cells infected with virulent virus rather than two lentogenic viruses (Figure 7A). Finally, we evaluated the cell injury caused by different genotypes NDV infection by LDH assay. As depicted in Figure 7B, pretreatment with 1 mM loxoribine for 6 h significantly decreased the virulent NDV strain NA-1 induced cell damage. Taken together, TLR7-mediated macrophage polarized activation inhibits virulent NDV replication and restores virulent virus-induced macrophage polarized activation and cell damage.",

However, recent findings demonstrated that macrophages could be a double-edged sword in virus clearance and pathology: they not only help fight against virus infection, but may also contribute to virus production and dissemination during viral infections (26, 64). In mammal models, a number of viruses have been found target macrophages and impair the function of these cells (65\u201367). By contrast, limited information is known about the interaction between chicken viruses and chicken macrophages. For example, previous studies showed that macrophages may be acting as a main target cell for some avian viruses infection and dissemination from the respiratory tract to nearby tissues and organs, which are necessary for continuation of the virus growth cycle (27, 68\u201370). Although macrophages are considered to be one of the main target cells for NDV infection and growth in vivo (59), very little is known about the ability of NDV to infect macrophage and the mechanisms of consequent macrophage responses to virus infections. The cell culture results in the present work indicated that chicken macrophages support the replication and growth of NDV strains of varying virulence and genotypes, and the results are in agreement with previous studies (59, 71\u201373).",

However, the underlying mechanisms of virulent and lentogenic NDV strains infection as well as host responses to infections of different virulence and genotypes of NDV are still largely unknown. Although all NDV strains can infect and replicate in macrophages, it remains unclear how productive infection of macrophage by different virulence and genotypes NDV strains is impaired. In this study, we selected three different virulence and genotypes of NDV (including class II virulent genotype VII strain NA-1, class II lentogenic strain genotype III strain LaSota, and class I lentogenic genotype I strain F55), processed a preliminary experiment, and found that MOI 2 was ideal for all three NDV strains used, and no cytopathic effect to cells when treated with virulent strain NA-1 during the early stage of infection (from 4 to 12 hpi).",

Results indicated that all three NDV strains had similar replication and growth rate during the early stage of infection (from 4 to 12 hpi). However, virulent NDV replication and growth rate was shown to increase sharply from 24 hpi to a peak at 72 hpi compared to two lentogenic viruses (Figure 2), and this growth was associated with a strong upregulation of both pro-inflammatory M1-like markers/cytokines and anti-inflammatory M2-like markers/cytokines in chicken macrophages (Figure 3). Therefore, such M1-/M2-like mixed macrophages polarized activation may contribute to virulent NDV replication and growth sharply during the later stage of infection. Although two lentogenic strains did not elicit stronger M1-like or M2-like markers/cytokines production, the expression pattern of these M1- and M2-like associated genes was found to be different between cells infected with the two lentogenic viruses. In details, class I lentogenic F55 induces a mild M2-like macrophage polarized activation and class II lentogenic LaSota induces a mild M1-like macrophage polarized activation (Figure 3A).",
