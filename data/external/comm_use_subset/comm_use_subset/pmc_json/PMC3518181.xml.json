Several factors have been put forward as potential drivers of the spatio-temporal dynamics of influenza pandemics, including population contact rates, travel patterns, climatic conditions, and geography. Recent studies of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic have quantified the role of demographic factors, school cycles and social distancing measures (e.g., school closure) on disease transmission\n[1-5], but their effect combined with climatic factors is less clear\n[6,7]. In particular, experimental studies indicate that aerosol transmission of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza is sensitive to temperature and humidity levels\n[8]. Moreover, the timing and intensity of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic waves varied substantially across regions of the world\n[1,2,9-14], suggesting a potential link with local meteorological conditions. Further, the occurrence of recrudescent waves of pandemic activity in the South-Eastern US in winter 2010 was associated with low humidity levels\n[15].",

Timing of pandemic activity coincided with the typical influenza winter season in this region which spans the months of May-September. Few studies have characterized A/H1N1 transmission dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere\n[2,5,20], and no study has explored variation in disease transmission at a small spatial scale in this region. Here we characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of the 2009 influenza pandemic across Chile, a country which combines an extended latitudinal range with a solid epidemiological surveillance system. In this work, we assessed the relative contribution of environmental conditions, demographic factors, contact rates, and international travel patterns on pandemic A/H1N1 transmission, by modeling a large dataset of weekly hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection in the 15 administrative regions of Chile.",

All regions experienced a single peak of pandemic activity. We analyzed the association between the dates of pandemic onset and peak timing with population size, latitude of population centres, climatic factors averaged during the exponential growth phase by geographic region and international inflow of air traffic and arrivals at seaports in May 2009 using univariate Spearman correlations. Finally, we built a multivariate linear regression model with all predictor variables to disentangle the factors explaining geographical variation in pandemic onset and peak timing across Chilean regions.

In the early stages of an epidemic, the epidemic grows exponentially, as the effect of increasing incidence on the depletion of the susceptible population remains small\n[39-41]. The exponential growth rate, r, can be estimated from the exponential growth phase of the pandemic, using a Poisson maximum likelihood method as explained in the Additional file\n2: Supplement.

To assess the potential impact of school vacation on pandemic transmission, we evaluated trends of A/H1N1-positive SARI hospitalizations among students and non-student popualtions. At the national scale, the ratio of student to non-student cases decreased significantly by 76% during the 15-day winter vacation period relative to the preceding 15-day period (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.001). Given the asynchrony in pandemic activity across Chile, the school vacation period coincided with different phases of the pandemic in different regions. In the northern area, the pandemic peaked at about the same time as the start of the winter vacation period. In contrast, pandemic activity in the central and southern regions had substantially declined when the winter vacation period began (Figure\n5). Accordingly, the change in age distribution of cases associated with the winter vacation period was most pronounced in the North (220% reduction in the student to non-student ratio; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.02), intermediate in the central geographic area (75% reduction, Wilcoxon test, P = 0.03), and non-existent in the Southern area (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.2).",

We found that the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza in Chile was characterized by a South to North gradient of increasingly late peak activity and decreasing disease transmissibility. Geographical variation in pandemic peak timing was associated with differences in latitude and climatic conditions, with latitude, maximum temperature and specific humidity accounting for 69-80% of the variability. Our findings could have important public health implications.

We used data on all SARI hospitalizations as well as a subset of hospitalizations that were laboratory-confirmed for A/H1N1 infections, representing all public and private hospitals in Chile. Testing rates for A/H1N1 influenza remained at 35% throughout the pandemic and were comparable to those of other countries\n[1]. Moreover, national respiratory virus surveillance for influenza-like-illness demonstrated that A/H1N1 predominated among other respiratory viruses in 96% of individuals aged 5 years and over\n[47]. In contrast, RSV co-circulated with A/H1N1 influenza among children < 5 years, although influenza remained the dominant virus in this age group\n[18,47]. Because a total of 365 (5.7%) of the SARI hospital records were missing the date of symptoms onset, we used the date of notification for 197 of these records for which the date of notification was available. Differences in reporting across regions cannot be ruled out, although there was no evidence of weaker reporting rates in less populous regions. On the contrary, regions with lower population sizes reported more SARI hospitalizations proportionally than larger regions in Chile. We note that our estimates of the reproduction number were derived using simple methodology relying on the initial growth rate of the pandemic across geographic areas of Chile\n[41,67]. More detailed epidemiological data providing information on the number of imported cases could have allowed the use of more refined estimation methods, but were not available to us (see e.g.,\n[68,69]).",

The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001). These two findings suggest that meteorological conditions may have modulated the transmissibility of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza in Chile. Our results could have significant public health implications for pandemic influenza control. Specifically, intensified surveillance strategies in southern regions could lead to early detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes. Furthermore, the spatial differences in the timing of local pandemic influenza in our study demonstrate the advantages of using high-resolution data to detect heterogeneous pandemic patterns. More studies are needed to determine whether these findings may be generalized to seasonal influenza epidemics and may be integrated in pandemic preparedness scenarios.",
