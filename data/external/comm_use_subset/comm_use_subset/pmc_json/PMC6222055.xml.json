            "text": "Global maternal and infant mortality remains unacceptably high in the 21st century. Despite a 44% reduction since 1990, the global maternal mortality ratio was estimated to be 216 (207 to 249) per 100,000 live births in 2015, with 303,000 (291,000 to 349,000) maternal deaths (830 per day), mostly associated with pregnancy and childbirth complications, 99% occurring in the developing world (1). Similarly, 4.9 million children under 5 years of age died in 2015 (nearly 16,000 every day), with neonatal mortality accounting for approximately 45% of all deaths (2). The World Health Organization has therefore included in their 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets the goal to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to <70 per 100,000 live births and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, aiming for all countries to reduce neonatal mortality to \u226412 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to \u226425 per 1,000 live births (2). To achieve these targets, interventions addressing the prominent causes of mortality in these target groups are required. Expansion, enhancement, and integration of maternal and early life immunization, key public health interventions, have the potential to address some of these goals (3). Pregnant women and infants have a high risk of exposure to infectious disease, and vaccines administered during pregnancy and/or early life offer the potential to protect, depending on the vaccine, mothers against infection-related morbidity and mortality and infants against infection-related morbidity, neonatal death, stillbirth, and preterm birth. The feasibility of maternal immunization is supported by the success of the longstanding Maternal Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) program. Given the growing number of vaccines recommended for use during pregnancy (i.e., influenza and pertussis), and of new maternal vaccines in development (i.e., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] and group B streptococcus [GBS]), it is critical to understand the challenges and opportunities to implement maternal immunization in areas where vulnerable populations would benefit the most, including low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), leveraging existing antenatal care (ANC) programs. In 2015, experts at a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)-convened meeting on maternal immunization in resource-limited settings agreed that maternal immunization must be integrated within the ANC platform (4). This approach is supported by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), who have advised the World Health Organization (WHO) to generate generalizable data on the best ways to integrate maternal immunization into routine antenatal care in low-resource settings. Several global projects are addressing this mandate and identifying opportunities and challenges for the introduction of new vaccines for maternal immunization: the Maternal Influenza Immunization project, which provides guidelines for the implementation of influenza vaccination in pregnant women in LMIC, and the Maternal Immunization in Antenatal Care Situational Analysis (MIACSA), which aims to evaluate tetanus maternal vaccine delivery via existing ANC programs and identify opportunities and challenges for the introduction of new vaccines for maternal immunization (5). Vaccines specifically being developed for maternal immunization include a vaccine against GBS, the leading etiologic agent of neonatal sepsis and neonatal meningitis plus substantial maternal morbidity/mortality during pregnancy and postpartum, and an RSV vaccine in order to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality caused by RSV in young infants. Similarly, PATH\u2019s Advancing Maternal Immunization (AMI) collaboration, in collaboration with WHO, evaluates RSV implementation as a maternal vaccine, particularly in LMIC (https://sites.path.org/cvia/our-disease-targets/respiratory-syncytial-virus/advancing-maternal-immunization-ami/).",

In response, WHO developed a GBS Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) guideline and a Vaccine Development Technology Roadmap to focus on activities leading to development, testing, licensure, and global availability of GBS vaccines. These documents are available at http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/ppc_groupb_strepvaccines/en/. In April 2016, SAGE acknowledged the high importance of RSV vaccine development to prevent pediatric morbidity and mortality. Since then, an RSV vaccine has been advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in pregnant women. To further inform vaccine development, licensure, and prequalification, WHO has developed guidance on RSV vaccine efficacy trial design (prevention of acute disease) with focus on LMIC, an RSV vaccine technology roadmap, and an RSV vaccine Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) document to guide vaccine development and evaluation. These can be found at http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/ppc_rsv_vaccines/en/.

The overarching focus of the conference was to identify the path forward to achieve integration of maternal and early life immunization strategies for the successful implementation of vaccines in antenatal care and the harmonization of vaccination and maternal and neonatal health care programs to impact maternal and infant mortality worldwide. Nearly 300 participants attended the two-and-a-half-day meeting that included 16 invited expert presentations, 25 oral presentations from submitted abstracts, 30 poster presentations, and 2 expert panel discussions. The meeting sessions were organized to begin on day 1 with the general topic of immunology, including understanding antibodies and their transfer from mother to infant, neonatal immunization, and heterologous immunity. The second day was dedicated to providing updates on vaccines under development for maternal and neonatal immunization, addressing also safety, awareness, and perception issues. Finally, the third day focused on implementation aspects of maternal and neonatal immunization worldwide and future directions, including new and future targets of maternal and neonatal immunization.",

            "text": "(i) Antibodies and their transfer. As an introduction to the development of new vaccines, Margaret Ackerman (Dartmouth College, USA) discussed how vaccine design can be informed by systems serology, an approach she pursues in collaboration with Galit Alter (Ragon Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA). Using HIV infection and HIV vaccines as examples, Dr. Ackerman illustrated how machine-learning tools can be employed to learn the principles of an effective antibody (Ab) response in human subjects. Specificity and neutralizing activity of antibodies (Abs) are dependent on their Fab (fragment antigen binding) domain, whereas the Fc (fragment crystallizing) domain mediates effector functions through their interactions with innate immune cells and complement. The importance of these interactions is illustrated by the reduced efficacy of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies with mutations preventing their interaction with Fc receptors (6). The effector functions that can be mediated by IgG Fc domain are diversified by the different IgG subclasses and by posttranslational modifications primarily involving glycosylation. The importance of Fc glycosylation is illustrated by the impact of maternal antiplatelet IgG fucosylation on the severity of fetal thrombocytopenia. To gain insight into the rules governing vaccine efficacy, Ab responses to two HIV vaccine formulations based on the same antigens (VAX003 versus Rv144) were compared. A large range of features was assessed to broadly characterize Abs and identify correlates of protection. Structural Ab features could be linked to receptor binding and functional properties, and these could be correlated with vaccine efficacy. These observations support the notion that systems serology could inform vaccine design for diverse populations, including pregnant women and infants.",

            "text": "Dana Wolf (Hadassah University Hospital, Israel) discussed how congenital infections provide insight in placental biology and transfer of maternal immunity. The placenta plays a central role in maternal tolerance of the fetus and actively transports maternal IgG via the neonatal Fc receptor expressed by syncytiotrophoblasts. The placenta is also an innate immune barrier against pathogens. Syncytiotrophoblasts are known to be resistant to infection with multiple pathogens. It is thought that fetal infection may involve the transplacental transport of complexes formed by pathogens and maternal antibodies. On the other hand, infection of the decidua, forming the maternal component of the placenta, is likely to be the initiation of pathogen transmission to the fetus. Dr Wolf presented the development of ex vivo models of infection of decidua cultures allowing the characterization of pathogen spread and innate immune responses. These models demonstrated that cytomegalovirus (CMV) spreads from cell to cell whereas Zika virus (ZIKV) spreads via the extracellular space. Gene expression analyses revealed that CMV and ZIKV induce distinct placental responses that may underlie distinct mechanisms of viral control and tissue damage. In-depth analysis of gene expression indicated that the intrinsic cellular restriction factor APOBEC3A (A3A) may be an important innate mechanism of CMV control at the placental level (7). This work should help the development of interventions protecting placental functions and preventing pathogen transmission following maternal infections.",

Different maternal antibody kinetics but similar half-lives were noted in young infants in both countries (concentrations at birth were lower in infants in Vietnam than in infants in Belgium). Future research will assess the impact of the timing of maternal vaccination at different stages of gestation on antibody concentrations in infants at birth, to further refine these models. Mustapha Jaiteh (Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia [MRCG], at the London School of Tropical Medicine [LSHTM]) presented preliminary results suggesting an impact of maternal vaccination with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the presence of vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in colostrum and a potential mechanism underlying neonatal protection via maternal immunization through breast milk antibodies.",

Immune ontogeny in early life shapes innate and adaptive responses and is influenced by maternal cofactors (9). Immune plasticity is required to integrate genetic and environmental factors and to adapt to the ex utero environment. Immune components central to vaccine responses, including antigen-presenting cells, B cells, and T cells, function differently at birth than later in life. Maternal cofactors influencing immune ontogeny and immune responses in early life include chronic maternal infections, nutrition, and the microbiome and the levels and specificity of maternally acquired antibodies. Vaccines currently given at birth provide strong evidence that protective immunity can be induced by vaccination and can also inform on the potential of neonates to develop specific immune responses and on the impact of cofactors. Studies of BCG immunization have demonstrated that Th1 responses can be induced at birth and that BCG vaccination can have heterologous effects on the response to other vaccines and on overall infant mortality (8, 10). Studies of hepatitis B and oral polio immunization at birth indicated that priming of memory B cells can be achieved in early life, allowing the option to immunize infants at birth. An ideal vaccine to be administered to neonates would induce rapid immune response even in the presence of MatAbs and would have an optimal safety profile (11).",

The majority of deaths due to whooping cough occur in the first two months of life. Pertussis vaccination in early life has resulted in variable outcomes. Historical studies suggested that immune tolerance may result from neonatal pertussis immunization with whole-cell vaccines. More recent studies showed that acellular pertussis vaccination at birth increases the response to the second dose of vaccine at 2 months of life (a priming role). Some studies showed reduced responses to vaccines concomitantly administered with the second pertussis vaccine dose. Another limitation of pertussis immunization at birth may be the induction of Th2-polarized cellular immune responses. Neonatal pertussis immunization may be indicated in babies born to mothers who have low Ab levels, reduced response to pertussis vaccine, or reduced transfer of MatAbs. From a public health point of view, the feasibility of such indications can be questioned. Several studies of neonatal Hib immunization showed good safety and priming of booster responses with polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria CRM 197 protein (PRP-CRM) and PRP-tetanus protein (PRP-T) vaccines but reduced booster responses to a PRP-outer membrane protein (PRP-OMP) vaccine. Studies of neonatal immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine showed good safety and early induction of Abs, but their impact on invasive disease or carriage has not yet been demonstrated.",

The presence of MatAbs results in interference with active infant immunization. These data are useful for modeling the impact of programs that utilize a combination of maternal and infant vaccination strategies. Ofer Levy (Precision Vaccines Program, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA) presented preliminary in vitro studies employing human whole-blood assays raising the possibility that BCG formulation heterogeneity may contribute to variability in clinical benefit, including \u201coff-target\u201d heterologous protection, highlighting the need to further standardize and compare different BCG vaccines to optimize benefit. Data presented by Ed Clarke (MRCG at LSHTM, The Gambia) showed that vaccine-specific memory B cell responses to pneumococcus antigens can be detected in mothers and infants after maternal immunization with 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Gaelle Noel (University of Maryland School of Medicine, USA) presented data demonstrating that breast milk enhances the intestinal mucosal barrier in a pediatric human enteroid model. John Ojal\u2019s (KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Program) data indicated that naturally acquired MatAbs against pneumococcal proteins protect infants from carriage whereas vaccine-induced antipolysaccharide Abs may require concentrations higher than those induced by natural immunity to be effective (13).",

            "text": "(iii) Heterologous immunity. Mihai Netea (Radboud University, The Netherlands) reviewed the concept of innate immune memory and heterologous effects of vaccines. He highlighted that upon introduction of BCG vaccine in Sweden in 1927 to 1931, infant mortality dropped from 11% to 4% in a manner that could not be accounted for solely by prevention of tuberculosis. Subsequently, randomized studies of low-birth-weight newborns in Guinea Bissau demonstrated that newborns who received BCG at birth versus at 2 months had an \u223c50% reduction of mortality. Several investigators have hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying such rapid BCG effects may relate to innate immunity. From an evolutionary perspective, it may not seem logical that vertebrates, representing only 5% of all known organisms, would rely on only adaptive responses for immunological memory. Moreover, broad systemic acquired resistance to pathogens is well described in plants and can be transmitted to the next generations via epigenetic mechanisms. Such innate memory also exists in mammals but has been less well studied. For example, in mice lacking T and B lymphocytes, myeloid cells provide protection following vaccination with Candida. This protection also involves epigenetic mechanisms. Key histone modifications increasing access to chromatin are detected in primed monocytes, and blocking these modifications inhibits cell priming. These epigenetic modifications are related to metabolic changes, including changes in the Krebs cycle, also demonstrable in human adults following BCG vaccination. Their relevance for antimicrobial defense is supported by recent data indicating decreased viral replication in subjects who received BCG before yellow fever vaccination (14). Overall, it is evident that innate immune responses can change in an adaptive manner after infection or vaccination.",

Selena Alonso (Barcelona Institute for Global Health, Spain) discussed the impact of maternal infections on infant responses to vaccines. She presented results of a study conducted in Mozambique indicating altered immune responses to vaccine antigens (Hib, rotavirus, pertussis, and diphtheria) in infants born to mothers infected with HIV or malaria. Unexpectedly, intrapartum prophylaxis with mefloquine had a negative impact on vaccine responses. Jishnu Das (Ragon Institute, USA) described a study conducted in Belgium and showing that HIV-exposed uninfected infants are at higher risk of hospitalization for infection of various etiologies than unexposed infants. Risk of hospitalization was related to time at initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the pregnant women and was predicted by immune alterations measured at birth. The risk for hospitalization was 4-fold higher when mothers initiated therapy during pregnancy but not significantly increased when treatment was started before pregnancy (16).",

Fiona Culley (Imperial College London, United Kingdom) reminded the audience that RSV is the leading single cause of hospitalization of infants worldwide and a significant cause of global deaths, especially in LMIC. As adults can be repeatedly infected with the same RSV strain, natural immunity may be only partially effective. Natural serum Ab is associated with protection, although nasal RSV-specific IgA may provide better correlation. The best evidence of protection comes from the success of monoclonal antibody (MAb) to F protein. On the other hand, the age profile of RSV disease supports an association between susceptibility and levels of MatAb. One modeling study showed that for every doubling of Ab by a vaccine, severe disease may be reduced by 30% and protection prolonged for an additional 50 days. Maternal immunization is an attractive option, and a number of vaccine candidates are under development and evaluation (15, 17). Factors that are important to consider for candidate vaccines include how much Ab is generated in the mother, the variability of the response, the best gestational age to vaccinate, the protection of the mother, the placental transfer of Ab, the impact of breast feeding, the persistence of the presence of passively acquired Abs, the possible interference with infant response to natural infection, and the potential effect of delaying the age of infection to later in childhood. Additional strategies to be considered include cocooning, the use of pediatric RSV vaccines, and of extended-half-life MAb formulations.",

Previous estimates show the virtual absence of GBS in Southeast Asia. This observation contrasts with the substantial maternal colonization rates in that setting. Underdetection of invasive infections may be due to the fact that 90% of early-onset disease occurs on day 1 of life and the bulk of disease and attributable infant mortality will be unrecognized if cases die at home or are not investigated adequately in health care facilities due to resource constraints. Even in high-income countries with effective use of intrapartum antibiotics, there remains a residual burden of early-onset disease, and intrapartum prophylaxis has had no impact on late-onset disease. Since the historical observation that lower levels of anticapsular Ab are correlated with invasive disease, work to define a threshold associated with protection has progressed but has been limited by the use of different and unstandardized assays. Recent studies of conjugate vaccines have demonstrated safety and immunogenicity with good persistence of Abs in vaccinated mothers, with variation by preexisting natural immunity, comorbidities, and ethnicity. Good placental transfer and Ab persistence in infants have also been observed, but long-term persistence of MatAb may be less important for GBS than for other infections such as RSV because the highest burden of GBS mortality is in the first week of life, and coverage for the first 3 months of life through maternal vaccination is sufficient to address both early- and late-onset disease. HIV infection is an important risk factor for infant GBS disease, and lower responses to candidate GBS vaccines have been seen in HIV-infected than in uninfected women. Dr. Madhi referred to two recent WHO publications describing the pathway for development and preferred product characteristics for GBS vaccines (20, 21).",

Evidence is robust that maternal immunization with acellular pertussis vaccines is safe and effective in protecting neonates and young infants from disease. This is in line with the increasing body of evidence supporting safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of Tdap in pregnancy (23, 24). Studies evaluating the optimal timing of vaccination during pregnancy indicate that vaccination in the second or early third trimester might result in higher neonatal Ab concentrations (25, 26). The impact of MatAbs modifying the infant immune responses, however, is one of the remaining challenges of Tdap vaccination in pregnancy research (27\u201329).

She highlighted that the collection of safety data in clinical trials and routinely following implementation would present different challenges. Paper-based, patient-held immunization records currently in use in these countries do not have fields for recoding of essential data, including vaccine lot number, manufacturer, volume, and site of immunization. A lack of reliable electricity supply and computer/tablet hardware availability in many LMIC limits electronic data capturing. In a clinical setting in South Africa, creative solutions such as the use of different sizes of local coins to allow evaluators to consistently measure the size of local vaccine reactions have been utilized. In the majority of LMIC, pregnancy records are maintained on paper cards, which are taken home by the mother postdelivery. No system for the central storage of antenatal data is in place, hampering assessment of background rates of maternal, fetal, and newborn adverse events and making retrospective studies nearly impossible. A number of steps that could be taken to enhance safety reporting in LMIC were described to ensure that the future introduction of vaccines where they are most needed will not be delayed.",

He highlighted the gap in implementation research, the need to optimize delivery strategies for vaccines in pregnancy, and the importance placed on supporting such research as highlighted by WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in 2015. The progress, challenges, and opportunities for maternal influenza immunization as identified by each of the WHO Regions were then described. While in the African region (AFRO) competing infectious disease priorities were of significant concern, low population uptake in the European region (EURO) was a particular challenge. Currently, the Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO) is reported as the region making the strongest progress overall. Dr. Lambach described the framework for introducing a new maternal vaccine into a country program starting from the decision by policy makers and moving through the role of those undertaking the implementation in planning the introduction, undertaking training and ensuring effective communication, and subsequently monitoring and evaluating the program. Finally, the \u201cWHO Maternal Influenza Introduction Implementation Manual\u201d was fittingly launched on the day of the meeting (12 September 2017) and was recommended to the audience as a source for Extended Program on Immunizations (EPI) managers and other interested parties planning such introductions (5).

An ideal schedule was considered to offer the best opportunity to provide optimal protection with the minimum of risk. It was highlighted that the 6-, 10-, and 14-week primary immunization schedule had been adopted to maximize vaccine coverage in early infancy as rapidly as possible and had been highly effective at preventing disease. However, in reality most infants receive their vaccines at an average of 2.5, 4.5, and 8 months of age. The many factors affecting an infant\u2019s response to their primary series were listed, and Dr. Asturias reviewed a number of the key publications demonstrating the effects of MatAbs, including breast milk Abs, on infant vaccine immunogenicity (32\u201339). He also highlighted the growing appreciation of the role of the microbiota in infant immunity (40, 41). He concluded that true integration of maternal and infant immunization schedules might involve a delay in the administration of those vaccine antigens against which the infant was effectively protected by MatAbs until such Abs had waned sufficiently. This would also provide greater opportunities for the later booster vaccinations required for long-term protection and, in many cases, indirect protection in the population.",

Over 90% vaccine effectiveness has been demonstrated consistently since introduction (23). In the United Kingdom, infant mortality from pertussis has substantially decreased since the introduction of maternal Tdap vaccination, with no cases of death reported to date in infants born to correctly vaccinated mothers (43).

In a mouse model of maternal antibody (MatAb) transfer and challenge study, Dr. Ndungo demonstrated that Shigella antigen-specific IgG and functional Abs can be transferred to pups via placenta and milk of immune mothers, that maternal vaccination (systemic IgG) protects infant mice against mucosal infection, and that protection persists beyond weaning.

Ajoke Sobanjo-ter Meulen (BMGF, USA) emphasized that globally, the neonatal mortality rate is declining more slowly than the childhood mortality rate. She also noted growing numbers of facility-based births, especially in India, with significant implications for health care-associated neonatal infections. She showed data from the Delhi Neonatal Infection Study (DeNIS) collaboration from 3 hospitals in Delhi with high antimicrobial resistance rates among neonatal pathogens, especially Gram-negative bacteria (45). Countries with the highest mortality rates also demonstrate higher sepsis death rates as well as higher prematurity and intrapartum stillbirth rates. These outcomes may reflect underlying infection, and evidence to support this hypothesis exists from the CHAMPS study (https://champshealth.org). A recent review has now estimated the burden of global deaths due to sepsis with antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms (46). Maternal vaccines (especially RSV and GBS) have the potential to reduce AMR by reducing the empirical use of antibiotics. Regarding GBS strains, she mentioned rising rates of resistance to second-line antibiotics such as macrolides and tetracycline. She noted the large number of women in high-income countries who are receiving antibiotics in labor in order to prevent (early-onset) GBS disease. Thus, effective vaccines could potentially reduce the numbers of infections, reduce the need for antibiotics, reduce the emergence of resistant strains, and improve prevention of resistant strains. Theoretically, a vaccine could be used to target determinants of antibiotic resistance, and vaccines against important Gram-negative pathogens are already on the horizon (47). The development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) at birth is also part of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation strategy, whereas prophylactic MAbs could be given to infants determined to be at risk. MAbs may reduce the need for or the duration of antibiotics. This approach could potentially be combined with maternal immunization against the pathogens discussed above.",
