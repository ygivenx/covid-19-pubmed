However, these assays are highly dependent on previous knowledge of the virus, and thus are ineffective in identifying new pathogens and are less effective in identifying novel variants of a known pathogen4. Mainly, these methods rely on knowledge about the viral sequence at hand, and hence relevant nucleic acid probes (primers) are used. Accordingly, rare viruses that are not commonly examined in the laboratory, will not be detected using these conventional methods.",

Use of NGS eliminates the need for prior knowledge of virus genomic sequences and provides advantages over traditional methods such as PCR amplification or microarray hybridization, that are dependent on target-specific primers3. To date, NGS has been instrumental in the discovery of novel viruses and characterization of viral communities. NGS was used to discover a new arenavirus5, a new ebola virus6 and zika virus7. NGS is also applied for the characterization of viruses in the environment8,9, in animals10 and in humans11,12. Here, we describe a new NGS-based method designed to identify viruses in a pool of clinical samples.",

However, a higher percentage of patients still suffered from a respiratory infection of unknown etiology, with clinical symptoms compatible with viral infection (Fig. 1). We therefore set out to develop a general and robust approach to identify the unknown viruses responsible for ILS. Three possibilities were considered: (1) The cause of the ILS is an unknown virus or a known virus not yet associated with respiratory illnesses; (2) the cause of the ILS is a virus not commonly tested in the laboratory; (3) the cause of the ILS is a known virus that causes respiratory infection that cannot be identified in the routine RT PCR tests due to variability.",

The remaining 288 samples (Fig. 2), were then assayed by qRT-PCR for: rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 3, bocavirus and coronaviruses; 234 samples were found to be positive (Fig. 2). In the next step, the remaining 54 samples and 8 positive control samples (2 influenza A, 2 influenza B, 2 RSV and 2 adenovirus) were treated with OmniCleave, which destroys free DNA and RNA, leaving the viral genome unaffected, as it is protected by a capsid. qRT-PCR of all samples for the cellular gene RNaseP was performed. Following treatment, the control virus amount remained unchanged, while RNaseP levels were reduced (resulting in higher cycle threshold (Ct) Fig. 3). The treatment efficiency threshold was set at Ct RNaseP > 35. We selected Ct > 35 since this indicates low levels of human genome that will not interfere with the viral identification. A level of Ct > 35 is equivalent to less than one copy of human DNA. The Ct of all control viruses, but two, was above 35. In one influenza B sample the Ct was 34.01 and in one adenovirus sample the Ct was 34.81. For the mixed sequencing we took one sample of each control virus.",

The vast majority of contigs mapped to a bacterial or a phage source.

Streptococcus pneumoniae was not detected in our samples (Fig. 5). These results imply that at least in one patient (sample 15) the ILS symptoms may have been a result of bacterial infection by Staphylococcus aureus. It is quite possible that there are more bacterial strains that cause ILS symptoms in our samples that were not detected.",

We did this to maximize library quality and the probability for viral detection. The sequencing results for the RNA viruses sample revealed three additional viruses that were not detected in the first sequencing. Those viruses are parainfluenza 4 virus and influenza C virus that cause ILS symptoms and rotavirus A which causes diarrhoeal disease. Parainfluenza 4 and influenza C were identified by RT-PCR in two clinical samples (parainfluenza 4 in patient number 49 and influenza C in patient 30).

Such infections impose a heavy economic burden, due to loss of working days, and they can be life-threatening. Thus, it is critical to monitor such infections from an early stage. However, occasionally the virus responsible for the infection cannot be identified. For example, we show here, that at the start of our screen, no common respiratory virus could be identified in 54 out of 300 (18%) samples collected from patients with ILS. Furthermore, new methods are needed to rapidly detect viruses present in a pool of samples to enable rapid treatment of the population in case of pandemics. Here, we presented a new NGS-based method to identify the viruses present in these samples.",

The original clinical diagnosis of our samples was infection with a viral agent, based on their symptoms. Nevertheless, our method also detected a sample that was most likely infected with a bacterial agent rather than a viral one. Interestingly, TTV was identified in many samples. TTV is the first human virus identified to have a circular negative-stranded DNA genome37. Its genome is approximately 3.8k nucleotides (nt) long38. TTV frequently circulates in many geographic regions24,38,39. Although this virus has a very high prevalence in the general population, neither its interaction with its hosts nor its direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Nevertheless, a significant correlation between TTV loads and airflow limitation within the peripheral airways, as well as between severity of bronchiectasis and decrease of lung function, has been observed40. Thus, it is possible that TTV was the cause of the ILS. Further studies will be necessary to confirm that TTV is indeed responsible for the ILS and to understand why TTV is present in some individuals (even in the healthy) but not in others.",
