In addition, the emergency room resident physicians (ERRPs) are at risk of falling ill from exposure to MERS patients and the possibility of spreading the illness to their family members, which could affect their overall effectiveness and willingness to work during a MERS outbreak. Therefore, their anxiety and fears must be taken seriously and strategies should be incorporated to manage them. The MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia was a very good opportunity to explore these concerns. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored ERRPs' perceptions and attitude toward MERS or the psychological impact of MERS on ERRPs in hospitals. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the perceptions, attitude, and psychological impact of MERS on ERRPs.",

As MERS was a new outbreak that began in Saudi Arabia, to our knowledge, this was the first study to address the impact of a MERS outbreak among ERRPs. The findings of our study showed that the majority of ERRPs believed that their work put them at risk of infection and they were afraid of contracting MERS. The majority of the ERRPs felt that their job would expose their families, parents, and close friends to risk of infection. A small pilot study conducted in a single center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in which the majority of respondents were nurses from the Philippines, did address the emotions and coping strategies of the healthcare workers who faced a MERS-CoV outbreak. It was found that the main sentiments centered upon fear for personal safety and the well-being of colleagues and family. Their fear was alleviated by positive attitudes in the workplace, clinical improvement of infected colleagues, and stoppage of disease transmission among healthcare workers after adopting strict protective measures. The most important emotion that drove them to continue working was their ethical and professional obligation toward their profession [8].",
