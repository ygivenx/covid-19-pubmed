It causes a major burden of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children under 5yrs of age with an estimated 3,000,000 hospital episodes annually in all countries [1]. The vast majority of this burden occurs in low income countries [1]. The age distribution of childhood severe disease is highly skewed towards young infants (<6m), with around 50% of all RSV associated hospitalisations in this age group, attributed to small airway blockage through inflammation and sloughing of infected epithelial cells [2]. Early vaccine development, focused on this vulnerable group resulted in disaster when a formalin-inactivated preparation administered to na\u00efve children led to exacerbated pneumonia and mortality upon natural RSV challenge [3]. Over the subsequent five decades, vaccination research for young infants has centred on live attenuated virus candidates (e.g. [4, 5]), but progress has been compromised by the presence of maternally derived antibodies (MAb), immunological immaturity, vaccine intolerance [3], and the legacy of uncertainty from the early vaccine failure.",

At the same time, there is recognition of the need to consider other groups to vaccinate to reduce the burden of infant disease. Older children aged 6 to 24 months are one of these groups\u2014they have the advantage of a more mature immune system, lower levels of interfering maternal antibody and greater tolerance [7]. Live attenuated virus vaccines (LAV) administered intranasally to seronegative children of this age have been shown to be both immunogenic and well tolerated e.g. [4, 5]. Importantly they are also shown not to predispose the child to enhanced disease following wild type exposure, and, although the trials are small in size, indicated protective efficacy [8]. There is an active clinical trial program for LAV candidates for the prevention of RSV associated lower respiratory tract infection in young children [6, 9, 10].",

There are clear direct benefits to be gained from vaccinating older children since a significant proportion of RSV severe disease occurs beyond the first 6 months of life [11]. However, the main emphasis remains the prevention of disease in early infancy, which would have to accrue from indirect protection (often called herd immunity). Manufacturers and funding agencies would be encouraged if it were to be shown that vaccinating older infants offered an additional indirect protection to the young infant. To what extent older age group vaccination will confer herd immunity to the vulnerable young infant is unclear [12, 13]. This forms the subject of this paper.",

            "text": "Analysis of a cohort study in Kenya has demonstrated that the severe risk in young children is principally associated with age at infection, not their lack of experience of infection [14]. Studies of transmission in households have shown that at least half of transmission to infants is due to infection introduced to the household by their older siblings [15, 16]. Both of these results support the idea that immunisation of older children against RSV could be used to reduce disease in infants by delaying primary infection until they are older. Vaccination provides both direct protection to those who are successfully immunized with the vaccine and indirect protection for those who are not immunized by decreasing the number of the infectious individuals. Therefore, the impact of immunisation of children on infection and disease in infants is largely determined by the rate at which infection is transferred between different risk or age groups [17\u201319]. Consequently, we explore two different, data-based formulations of the age-related contact matrix, and also perform a parameter sensitivity analysis.",

We estimate the duration and distribution of protection by inclusion of a variable number of stages, p, within the M class, all of which confer full protection. After maternal immunity has waned, individuals enter a fully susceptible class (S\n0) and may experience primary infection I\n0. After each infection, there is a period of transient solid immunity (P\n0,P\n1,P\n2) before individuals become partially susceptible (S\n1,S\n2) reflecting that multiple infection episodes within epidemics are rare [20, 21]. Previously infected individuals have reduced susceptibility to infection [22], reduced duration of infection [23, 24] and reduced infectivity of infection on infection. The incidence of disease (D) is related to age and episode while hospitalisation (H) is related to age. The rates, with respect to both time and age at which individuals flow from one epidemiological state to another are described in the system of ODE shown in Eqn A in S1 File. The infectiousness of second and subsequent re-infections is parameterized relative to primary infected class. The per capita rate of infection experienced by individuals in age class a at time t is given by \u03bb\na(t). As the transmission of RSV is seasonal, we included a cosine function, fitting both the amplitude (i.e. strength of seasonality) and phase (i.e. timing). Table 1 gives a description of the parameters and their estimated values. The initial conditions for the state variables for each age class were taken to be the pre-vaccination numbers found by running the model for a period of 50 years to its stable limit cycle. This ensures that the transient population and infection dynamics effects are minimized during model fitting and vaccination. The set of ODE\u2019s was solved numerically in Matlab\u00ae [25] based on an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order (4,5) using an adaptive time step.",

First, we use contact data that arise from diary data collected for a random sample of individuals who reside within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) [28, 29] (Fig 2A). Second, we estimate a synthetic contact matrix (Fig 2B) by weighted combination of three component matrices: a background homogeneous matrix, a matrix of contacts derived from household structure and a matrix of contacts derived from school attendance (Fig A in S1 File). The household occupancy data used for this synthetic matrix also arise from the registers of the KHDSS. Assuming that the WAIFW matrix is represented by \u03b2\nij, and the contact matrix by \u03c7\nij, then we link the two by assuming that the self-reported age-specific number of social contacts are proportional to the age-specific number of potentially infectious contacts [30], i.e \u03b2\nij = q\u03c7\nij where q is a disease specific infectivity parameter that we estimate by fitting the model to age-specific hospitalisation data.",

Surveillance started in 2002 on all children <5 years admitted in KDH with clinical symptoms of pneumonia, either severe or very severe. Nasal specimens were collected as soon as possible after admission by nasal washing and screening for RSV antigen was undertaken using an Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). The data used are the temporal and age-specific hospitalizations from Oct 2004 to Dec 2010. For more details on the study and the data, please refer to Nokes et al [11]. The risks of disease following infection are taken from a longitudinal cohort study of RSV infection in Kilifi, Kenya [14], and given in Table A in S1 File. The age-specific risk of hospitalization was estimated by fitting the static model (model with force of infection that is age-specific but constant in time) to hospitalization data. The initial vector was estimated from longitudinal data of RSV infections [12]. Once estimated from the static model, the risk of hospitalization remains fixed for fitting the dynamic model.",

The negative log-likelihood was used as the objective function of fmincon, which is a minimization routine in the computational software Matlab\u00ae [25]. To calculate the 95% confidence interval of the fitted parameters, we compute the central finite difference approximation to the Hessian of the log-likelihood estimates given the observed data to generate an asymptotic covariance matrix, and use a normal approximation [31]. To generate the bootstrapped confidence interval of the hospitalization data, we generated subsets, by both time and age, of data from the original set by sampling with replacement. The 95% confidence interval was taken as the region between the 97.5th and the 2.5th percentiles.

On the other hand, the synthetic model does not predict a change in the pattern except that the epidemic peaks are reduced. Fig 4B shows that the total vaccine effect (solid lines) is much greater than the direct effect alone (dashed lines)\u2013the difference is the indirect effect of protection of younger infants from infection. Fig 4C and 4D show the age-specific force of infection at equilibrium for the dairy and the synthetic models respectively. The solid lines shows pre-vaccination force of infection and the dashed lines show the force of infection with vaccination at 6 months at 70% coverage. It is clear from the figure that individuals aged between 2 and 20 years of age dominate the force of infection for the synthetic model. This can be attributed to the high number of contacts occurring within and between those age groups in the household. Immunisation is expected to change the average age at infection and this is shown in Fig 4E. This figure shows the change in the average age at primary (solid lines) and secondary (dashed lines) infections with a vaccine given at 6 months and for different vaccination coverages. The average age at primary infection increases from about 2 to 9 years (at 100% coverage) for the diary model (blue solid line) while the synthetic model predicts a relatively small increase, 2 to 2.5 years (red solid line).",

The outcome of fitting the model with different mixing assumptions gives results that are indistinguishable in terms of model fit and broadly consistent results in terms of the impact of immunisation. However, the results differ in a number of respects. First, there is a narrower range for the optimum age for the synthetic matrix, and the predicted impact is generally lower. Second, the two matrices are associated with very different underlying seasonal patterns of transmission. In fact the seasonal forcing that explains the observed epidemic pattern of RSV depends heavily on the details of the WAIFW. This is to be expected, and something worth exploring in more detail. If children are the \u201ccore group\u201d for RSV as they are for measles [36], then presumably contact patterns are seasonally forced by the school year pattern, which is known, and would provide indirect information on the WAIFW matrix. Because the fitted dynamics of infection vary considerably depending on the WAIFW structure, but the optimum age window is unchanged, we suggest that this result will hold for most other epidemiological settings. Consideration of the impact of demographics and mixing in other settings remain to be explored.",

However, the dynamic patterns predicted for the mixing matrices are different. The WAIFW matrix derived from contact diaries predicts an initial dramatic decline in cases as virus circulation is almost stopped for the first few epidemic seasons. As with other infections, this results in a build-up of susceptibles and a subsequent rebound of epidemics [35]. Although virus circulation returns in older age groups, the immunisation programme prevents a return to pre-vaccination levels of disease. The WAIFW matrix derived synthetically allows virus transmission to be maintained and precludes a rebound effect. Given that viral circulation is not predicted to be greatly curtailed, there is very little possibility of adverse consequences of immunisation, for example caused by increased susceptibility in adults.",

Using the diary matrix, the model is essentially a susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR) framework in which primary cases drive the transmission and re-infections are \u201cfollowers\u201d, i.e. if the primary cases are reduced, then circulation is suppressed. Vaccination results in a dramatically increased average age at first infection (Fig 4E), effectively reducing the risk of infants becoming infected during the most susceptible ages. Using the synthetic matrix, reinfections are more important sources of transmission, so that transmission continues in the face of vaccination. Contact patterns are dominated by children (compare Fig 4C and 4D), so the indirect protection comes from preventing the young infecting the very young, i.e. it is more dependent on the exact contact pattern between the youngest age groups. Vaccination is predicted to delay, rather than prevent, primary infection, so that the increase in average age at primary infection is relatively small, but has a large impact. The estimate of viral transmissibility (as measured by the basic reproduction number) using the diary approach is below that using the synthetic matrix, and the two models (same structure, different parameters) fall either side of the re-infection threshold [37, 38]. For the diary matrix, RSV is unable to persist on secondary and tertiary infections alone, whereas the synthetic matrix model does not require primary infections to persist. Note the relative infectiousness of the different stages is fixed, but the overall infectiousness is estimated given the different mixing structures. This yields very different estimates for the basic reproduction numbers for the two models, even though they fit the data equally well prior to vaccination.",

Our focus has been on the impact of vaccination, but we have also demonstrated that the prediction of infection dynamics and consequent impact of immune responses to infection depends critically on the mixing assumptions. Recent results have also demonstrated the importance of demographic processes (especially birth rate) [39], and environmental (atmospheric) conditions [40] in determining RSV transmission dynamics. Recent individual-based models including explicit household and school-based transmission comes to a similar conclusion to our own [41]. Similarly, the impact of vaccination has been shown to be beneficial in much simpler models (e.g. [42]). Clearly, the impact of vaccination needs to be assessed in a wide variety of models including these and other processes such as viral genetics [34], but no model has yet suggested that immunisation against RSV would not be beneficial.",
