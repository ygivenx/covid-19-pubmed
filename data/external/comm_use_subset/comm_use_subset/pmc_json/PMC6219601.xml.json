Depending on the host and virus virulence, MDV can cause more than 90% morbidity and mortality in susceptible chickens1. Chickens become infected by MDV following inhalation of infected dust via the respiratory route. MDV primarily infects macrophages, B and T cells and it mainly transforms CD4+ T cells although other T cell subtypes are susceptible to transformation2,3. Generally, MDV life cycle can be divided into the cytolytic phase (2\u20137 days post-infection - dpi), latent phase (7\u201310 dpi), late cytolytic phase, and transformation phase2. Lysis of lymphocytes and activation of TGF-beta + regulatory T cells are a few mechanisms among others which induce immunosuppression during MDV infection4. Furthermore, transformed T cells proliferate form lymphoma which can lead to immunosuppression and clinical and pathological signs of disease. In the course of infection, MDV replicates in feather follicular epithelium and sheds into the environment throughout the lifespan of an infected chicken.",

Because of the inability of vaccines to control MDV transmission, it is believed that vaccines have prompted the emergence of virulent strains of MDV5. Herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) is one of the MD vaccines which is extensively used worldwide either alone or in combination with other MD vaccine6. HVT can be administered in ovo at embryonic day 18 (ED18) to provide protection against MDV in young chicks. However, protection offered by HVT is inadequate especially against very virulent and very virulent plus pathotypes of MDV7. Moreover, this vaccine will not be protective against emerging highly virulent strains of MDV in the future. Therefore, it would be of interest to determine whether efficacy of HVT can be enhanced by addition of immune stimulants.",

            "text": "Innate and adaptive defense mechanisms are necessary to control MDV infection in chickens. In young chicks, it is likely that in ovo administered vaccines initially confer protection mainly via innate immune system cells including Natural Killer (NK) like cells and macrophages rather than adaptive immune responses8\u201311. In general, the activation of innate responses orchestrates the induction of adaptive responses which in turn require several days to provide protective immunity against an infection. However, this is not well understood in regard to MD vaccination. In general, the immune system in young chicks undergoes maturation and becomes functionally mature around 1\u20132 weeks of age. Therefore, the induction of adaptive immune responses might be limited in the early stage of life and immediately after hatching. It has been reported that chicken T cells exhibit poor responsiveness to mitogen stimulation and are functionally immature during the first 2 weeks of age12. In addition, although it has been shown that chickens start to mount antibody-mediated immune responses at 1 week of age, they usually display higher levels of antibody production when they are immunized around 2 weeks of age13,14. There is a paucity of information on how MD vaccine modulates innate responses in young chickens. The constitutive expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-18 that is measurable from ED12 and higher expression of these cytokines by day 7 post-hatch15 indicates that innate responses may be functional prior to hatching. As a result, these responses can be exploited to accelerate the maturation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Increased IFN-\u03b3 expression observed with in ovo HVT vaccination in chickens16 as well as increased NK like activity observed with HVT vaccination at hatch and post-hatch17,18 revealed that innate responses can be elevated to significant level with appropriate immune modulations19. In addition, it has recently been reported that in ovo administration of HVT vaccine accelerates the maturation of the immune system by activation and expansion of T cells at hatch20.",

In addition, TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and CpG-ODN, the ligand for TLR21 have been shown to stimulate innate responses mainly via the induction of interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)1-\u03b2 and, which may lead to a reduction in MD progression in chickens27. Prolonged availability of TLR-Ls in a controlled-release fashion which can be achieved by encapsulation in poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles has been shown to induce innate responses in vitro, in ovo and in vivo19,28.

Since a reduction of MDV load in feathers was observed in the current study, further investigation of MDV transmission pattern in the environment especially in the dust and between chickens will answer whether this reduction interrupts the spread of MDV.

Hence, organ weight indices were recorded to evaluate the changes occurring in BF and spleen following different treatments and MDV challenge in chickens. Administration of either ECpG and HVT or HVT alone possibly inhibited the initial cytolysis of B cells in BF as indicated by the BF:BW ratios similar to those of the control group. The observed abrogation of bursal atrophy is similar to the previous reports33,34. HVT administration with or without ECpG might have resolved the physiological changes which occurred in spleen at the initial stage of MDV infection since there was no difference in the ratios of spleen:BW between the chickens in HVT-administered group and uninfected group at 21 dpi. However, further investigation is needed to test this possibility.",

Previous study indicated that involvement of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in preventing DNA and virion synthesis in the case of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection35. Since MDV and HSV belong to the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, we can speculate that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 may have similar functions for preventing the replication of MDV in infected cells. Another study also revealed that TLR-Ls induced IFN-\u03b2 expression provide protection against HSV2 infection36. These lines of evidence and our findings support the role played by IFN-\u03b2 induced by ECpG and HVT in immunity against MD in chickens. IFN-\u03b3 possibly exerts anti-viral effects on MDV-infected cells directly or indirectly via activation of macrophages37. Significant upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 at 4 dpi in BF in some treatment groups compared to G6 indicates initial anti-viral effects which might have contributed to the subsequent reduction of tumors in chickens. Overall, the expression profile of IFN-\u03b3 in spleen and BF shows the association of IFN-\u03b3 with immunity to MDV infection. This is in agreement with previous studies showing the importance of IFN-\u03b3 in HVT conferred immunity in chickens38,39.",

It has been suggested that IL-10 curtails T helper (Th)1 immune responses, which are critical for protection, by deviating responses towards Th2 responses40. This could also be the case for MDV infection as an association between IL-10 expression and the disease was reported41,42. IL-10 affects dendritic cell (DC) maturation by inhibition of costimulatory molecules, DC induced T cell activation, antigen-specific T cell proliferation and function43,44; and it promotes the expansion of inducible T regulatory cells45. Notably, the experimental groups in the current study that exhibited significant reduction in tumor incidence displayed lower expression of IL-10 in spleen at 21 dpi. In addition, chickens that had tumors, expressed elevated levels of IL-10 in spleen and BF compared to those chickens that did not have tumors in each treatment group (data not shown). A similar pattern of IL-10 expression was recorded in previous studies in a different context, for example when chickens were vaccinated with bivalent or Rispens-CVI988 vaccine followed by MDV infection30,41. Therefore, previous reports were further confirmed and extended in the current study as the suppression of IL-10 was inversely associated with protection.",

It has been noted previously that expression of IL-18 diminished in MD resistant lines of chickens46 compared to that of susceptible lines and also in vaccine protected chickens compared to unvaccinated-infected controls39,41. Similar observations were confirmed in the current study as indicated by the association between decreased expression of IL-18 and protection against MDV as shown by the reduction of tumor incidence and MDV load in feathers. Moreover, IL-18 supports the metastasis of melanoma cells via elevated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)47. Therefore, it is probable that decreased expression of IL-18 in the current study may have abrogated the expression of VCAM-1, which possibly contributed to the reduction of tumor incidence.",
