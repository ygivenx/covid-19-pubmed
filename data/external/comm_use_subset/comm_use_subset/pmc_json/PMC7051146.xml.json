For example, HIV is featured by extensive genetic diversity due to its high replication rate and error-prone reverse transcriptase [3], and influenza viruses have types A to D where type A can be further divided into 18 distinct hemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes [4]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two glycoproteins of the influenza virus membrane that both recognize sialic acids; while HAs bind to sialic acids on carbohydrate side chains of cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids during the initiation of virus infection, NAs remove sialic acids from infected cell surfaces to allow the release of newly generated viruses to infect more cells [5]. These viral surface glycoproteins undergo antigenic drift that allows for evasion from preexisting humoral immunity [6]. It is therefore of the guiding importance to decipher the primary cellular changes that occur during virus infection with the hope of establishing universal therapeutic strategies targeting viral diseases. The target could be, for example, a panel of pivotal cell signaling players, each controlling one/multiple primary cell process(es) that affect(s) virus replication and having alternatives to maintain normal cell functionalities, or a region where multiple signaling pathways overlap in part of the larger global network.",

In mammals, the unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13), FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), and ATG101 are recruited either on cellular membranes at the ER-mitochondrial junction [16] or at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment [17] during the initiation phase in a manner strictly regulated by nutrient conditions through mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) [18]. The phagophore is produced by sequential recruitment of autophagy factors and membranes, which facilitates the formation of the curved double-membrane sheet that detaches from the membrane where it originates from. The class III phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) complex contains VPS34, Beclin 1 (ATG6), VPS15, ATG14L or UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein), where the regulatory subunits Beclin 1, VPS15, and ATG14L mediate phagophore membrane expansion during the elongation process. The class III PI3K complex is activated by Beclin 1 dissociation, resulting in the recruitment of PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) that promote the conjugation of lipid molecules [19]. Finally, the class III PI3K complex II which consists of VPS34, VPS15, Beclin 1, and UVRAG is activated to induce the GTPase activity of Rab7 (Ras-associated protein-7) that leads to autophagosome fusion with late lysosomes [20].",

For instance, rotavirus can hijack the membrane trafficking pathway of autophagy to transport its viral proteins to the site for genome replication and viral assembly [24], and the same mechanism may also apply to bluetongue virus (BTV) [25]. Second, autophagosomes provide the scaffold and concentrate nutrients for viral replication, and protect the intermediates from immune detection for, mostly, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Examples include poliovirus [26], HIV [27], dengue virus (DENV) [28] and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [29\n30,]. Third, autophagy provides nutrients for viral replication. For example, lipid droplets from the degradation of cholesterol in autolysosomes are required for HCV assembly [31]; bluetongue viruses induce autophagy to provide a sustainable cellular environment including, e.g. degraded nutrients and acidic condition to avail their replication [32]. Fourth, autophagy machinery facilitates the late stage of viral lifecycle including capsid maturation, envelopment (if applicable), and virus egress. For instance, proper maturation and envelopment of HIV and HBV involves physical interactions between their glycoproteins and autophagy elements such as LC3 [33]; and autophagosomes help the non-lytic egress of non-enveloped polioviruses through fusing double-membraned vesicles and plasma membrane [34]. Fifth, viruses such as influenza A modulate autophagy signaling by inhibiting MHC antigen presentation, which can prevent viruses from immune surveillance and create a favorable environment for viruses to survive [35]. Lastly, many viruses such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) [36], cytomegalovirus (CMV) [37], and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) [38] have developed strategies to suppress autophagy and avoid degradation.",

Some viruses encode viral proteins targeting TP53 given its central roles in growth arrest and apoptosis. While many viral proteins, including adenovirus E1B, the large T antigen of SV40, HBV oncoprotein HBx, IE84 from human CMV, and EBNA5 from EBV, inhibit TP53 activity through direct interactions, E6 of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes rapidly degrades TP53 via ubiquitin-directed pathway [49,50]. Some viruses encode proteins inhibiting the interleukin-1 converting enzyme family of cysteine proteases, which are pro-apoptotic. Examples here include crmA of cowpox virus, IAP and TP35 of baculoviruses [51\n52,]. Many viruses have evolved multiple ways to suppress host apoptosis. Take the influenza A virus for instance, many of its encoding proteins interfere with apoptosis, including neuraminidase that activates BCL2 and the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) that stimulates the PI3K/AKT pathway [53].",

The innate immune response is interconnected with and fed into the scheme of adaptive response via interferons (IFNs), which belong to cytokines and are required for pathogen elimination [69]. Upon viral infection, the molecular patterns of viruses are detected by various cellular sensors including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular helicases such as RIG-I and MDA5, which activate IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) such as IRF3 to induce the expression of a spectrum of IFN-responsive genes. Typical IFN-responsive gene products include, e.g., protein kinase R (PKR), endoribonuclease L (RNase L), promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and cellular restriction factors [71,72].

For example, HIV-1 modifies PAMPs by altering or hiding its nucleic acids in the viral capsid to mimic the cellular proteins, and randomly mutates its RNA genome to evade host immune recognition [73]; mononegavirale masks its RNA structure by adding a cap to obviate 3\u02b9ppp end exposure from RLR recognition and/or minimizes the production of transcript agonists of RIG-I [74]; West Nile virus evades host anti-viral detection via de novo synthesis of 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u02b9 cap of its RNA [75]; flavivirus achieves this by producing the NS5 proteins that perform 2\u02b9-O methylation of internal adenosine of viral RNA in vivo and host ribosomal RNAs in vitro [75]. Second, cellular sensors of immune response such as RIG-I can be targeted by viruses. For instance, HBV produces oncoprotein HBx to prevent the RIG-I induced IFN response and encodes other viral proteins to target adaptor proteins of the RIG-I mediated pathway [76]. Third, viruses inhibit immune response by targeting IFN-regulatory factors such as IRF3. For example, the polymerase of the retrovirus HBV inhibits IRF activation, and rotavirus provides nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) to degrade IRF3 that induces IFN response on viral infection [60]. Lastly, virus uncoating programs allow capsids to navigate the cell and disassemble in consecutive steps to ensure that genomes are released safely and under precise spatio-temporal control for replication to occur without being detected by the immune system [77].",

Viruses have evolved various strategies to block the formation of these complexes (Figure 4). First, some viruses produce proteins to activate CDK inhibitors such as P21 and P27. For instance, human neurotropic polyomaviruses (JCV) produce agnoprotein to cause G2/M arrest through P21 induction [96]; HBV induces G1/S arrest by modulating the expression of cell cycle-related genes including P21 [97]; influenza A virus generates multiple viral proteins to induce G0/G1 arrest by increasing P21 expression or preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation [94]; the P28 protein from murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces G0/G1 arrest by transcriptionally up-regulating P21 [98]; high P27 level was maintained in the G0/G1 blocked cells after measles virus infection [99]; and the 3B protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could lead to G0/G1 arrest by interfering with cell cycle regulatory genes including CDK inhibitors [100]. Second, some viruses inhibit complex formation by interacting with cyclins. For instance, parvovirus B19 NS1 protein prevents cyclin B nuclear export and thus leads to G2/M arrest [101]; HTLV-I encodes a P30 protein which interacts with cyclin E and leads to cell arrest at G1/S phase [102]; influenza A virus induces G0/G1 arrest by inhibiting cyclin production and stability [94]. Third, some viruses may attract cells in certain states via blocking nuclear transportation or accumulation of CDK-cyclin complexes. For instance, the E4 protein of HPV16 could set cells to G2/M arrest by sequestering the CDK1-cyclin B complex in cytoplasm and preventing it from nuclear entry [103]; HSV-1 and HSV-2 arrest cell cycle in the G1 phase by reducing the level of functional CDK2-cyclin E complexes after infection [104].",

The pRb and TP53 pathways are critical in the control of transiting cells from one phase to another. Some viruses produce viral proteins to suppress these signalings to promote cell cycle transition from the G0/G1 phase into the S phase. For example, the E1A proteins of AAV inactivate the pRb checkpoint to allow E2F activating genes involved in nucleotide metabolism and DNA replication to prepare materials needed for DNA synthesis in the S phase, and interact with transcriptional modulators of cell cycle to prevent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by stabilizing TP53 [112].

The ionic interactions between the virion and cell surface glycosphingolipids aid a number of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in their entry, as the adhesion of virions to cell membrane permits them to be recognized by the specific internalization receptors [115]. For instance, the infection of subgroup D viruses of adenoviruses occurs after binding to \u03b1 (2-3)-linked sialic acid (SA), a common carbohydrate component of glycolipids [116], and uses a positive feedback loop between virus uncoating and lipid signaling for efficient membrane penetration [117]. Many RNA viruses and some DNA viruses use lipids such as low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), phospholipids, and gangliosides for entry [118]. For example, glycosphingolipids are indispensable during the entry of parvovirus [119], gangliosides are required for the entry of SV40 [120], LDLR are used by several positive sense RNA viruses including HCV during infection [121]. In addition, viruses such as the double DNA simian virus 40 (SV40) and positive sense RNA echovirus type 1 (EV1) invade cells via caveolin-mediated endocytosis [122]. As caveolins directly bind and concentrate cholesterols and glycol-sphingolipids as well as lipid-modified signaling molecules such as Src-like kinases, eNOS, H-Ras, and heterotrimeric G proteins [123], caveolin-mediated endocytosis during viral invasion considerably enlarges the pool of viruses employing lipids for infection.",

The majority of RNA viruses such as HCV, dengue virus (DENV) and rotavirus replicate in cell cytoplasm, and some of their viral proteins co-opt in lipid signaling to establish peculiar niches for viral RNA replication [124\u2013126]. For instance, cytoplasmic lipid droplets function as a scaffold to assemble non-structural viral proteins and replication complexes for infectious HCV particle production, and as a vesicle to incorporate and export virus particles outside the cells [127]. Interactions between the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III alpha (PI4KIII\u03b1) and the nonstructural viral protein NS5A plays a crucial role in modulating the morphology of viral replication sites in HCV, where NS5A stimulates PI4KIII\u03b1 and PI4KIII\u03b1 affects NS5A phosphorylation status [128]. Poliovirus genome replication requires continuous phospholipid synthesis, suggesting physical interactions between viral replication complexes and these newborn membranes [129]. Lipids are also important components for viral envelopment and play various roles during viral egress (Figure 5) [126]. Assembly and budding of some viruses such as influenza virus are coupled with budozone formation, which are cholesterol/sphingolipid enriched plasma membrane rafts generated for viral egress [130]. High similarities between the lipid composition of Cyprinus Herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) and host lipid rafts reveal the importance of lipid in the envelopment and egress of CyHV-3 [131].

Promoting autophagy while suppressing apoptosis during the early stage of virus infection is common for many viruses. This is because that amphisome formation, nutrient, and energy supply are necessary during virus entry, delivery, and replication, and it is important to maintain a viable host cellular environment before the maturation of viral particles [138].

The consequences of cell cycle alteration can be very diverse including, e.g. maintaining a replicative state, preventing the passage of damaged DNA to daughter cells, initiating DNA damage repair and/or suppressing immune response. Such a process is typically associated with cell survival programs and regulated by pRB and TP53-mediated signalings [144]; Cell cycle arrest may lead to less immune response due to reduced cell production [145]. Lipid metabolic reprogramming avails in almost all stages of virus infection, i.e. from initial entry, till replication and assembly, to progeny egress. Lipid droplet, as an energy source, could be produced via cell survival programs to fuel viral production. Autophagy can regulate lipogenesis through modulating the degradation of triglycerides accumulated in cytosolic lipid droplets. Released fatty acids are imported to mitochondria where they undergo \u03b2-oxidation to produce ATP for viral replication [146]. Apoptosis is typically accompanied with rapid accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, by diverting fatty acids away from oxidation to de novo lipogenesis [147].",

Cell cycle arrest can provoke signals to induce apoptosis, where fatty acids such as butyrate are the pivotal molecules attracting cells in the arrested states [150]. Retroviruses, in particular, set cells to transient cell cycle arrest during its amalgamation into the host genome to activate enzymes necessary for DNA repair, and failed recombination lead to apoptosis [151].

Second, the panel of primary processes driving cell fate reprogramming in a particular infection may be some but not all of the five factors and differ among viruses. Third, underpinning these five identified processes on virus survival and replication does not exclude the probability of other processes contributing to virus replication control. Lastly, the identified 5 processes affecting virus replication correspond to 7 out of the 10 cancer hallmarks [155], i.e. the two cell survival programs could be covered by \u201csustaining proliferative signaling\u201d, \u201cevading growth suppressors\u201d, \u201cresisting cell death\u201d in cancer hallmarks, the immune response program could be matched to \u201cavoiding immune destruction\u201d and \u201ctumor-promoting inflammation\u201d cancer hallmarks, \u201ccell cycle alteration\u201d identified here and the \u201cenabling replicative immortality\u201d cancer hallmark both refer to cell cycle, and \u201clipid metabolic reprogramming\u201d is part of the \u201cderegulating cellular energetics\u201d cancer hallmark.
