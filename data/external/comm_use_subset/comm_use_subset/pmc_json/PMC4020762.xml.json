            "text": "In order to establish long-term infections, HPVs must actively avoid both adaptive and innate immune responses. HPVs prevent adaptive immune detection by several mechanisms in their unique life cycle. First, viral antigen production is limited to terminally differentiated keratinocytes of the mucosal and cutaneous epithelia. These cells are programmed to die of terminal differentiation, thus virus release coincides with limited inflammation and release of danger signals [15]. Additionally, there is no viremic stage of the HPV life cycle, which minimizes the activation of systemic immune responses [16]. Despite eliciting weak adaptive immune responses, the majority of primary HPV infections are cleared, thus suggesting the involvement of additional immune-mediated control mechanisms. Keratinocytes intrinsically express low-levels of interferons (IFNs) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03ba which induce interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression [17], [18]. However, the HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 actively target the IFN regulatory transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-1, respectively, resulting in an overall dampening of ISG responses during infection [19]\u2013[21]. Active subversion of the IFN pathway suggests that the innate immune response, specifically IFN-regulated genes, may interfere with HPV persistence.",

Additionally, two other DNA viruses, HCMV and Ad5, were unaffected by IFITM overexpression. Analysis of the rate of HPV capsid protein degradation in IFITM1 overexpressing primary keratinocytes revealed a delay in proteolytic degradation of virus capsids. Collectively, our results suggest that endosome trafficking, altered by IFITM overexpression, preferentially routes HPV to a more productive infectious pathway. Based on these results, we present the first study detailing the role of IFITMs in the entry of DNA viruses, showing that IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins do not restrict HPV, HCMV, and Ad5 infections. Our results suggest an evolutionarily conserved entry mechanism by these DNA viruses that bypasses the antiviral function of IFITMs that restrict many RNA viruses.",

At 48 h post infection (hpi), infectivity was measured by relative luciferase activity [43]. Although both IFN-\u03b1 and \u2013\u03b2 treatments significantly inhibited HPV16-LucF infection, the reductions seen with IFN-\u03b2 treatment were more robust at lower doses (Fig. 1A). RT-qPCR of selected ISGs (MX1, IFI44, IFIT1, IFITM1, 2, and 3) revealed enhanced expression of mRNAs following IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. S1). This indicates that, although keratinocytes are responsive to IFN-\u03b1 stimulation, IFN-\u03b2 treatment is more effective at reducing infectivity despite sharing a common surface receptor [44]. To exclude the possibility that the observed effect of IFN-\u03b2 on HPV infection might reflect cytotoxicity rather than inhibiting infection, we measured cell viability using a luminescence-based ATP quantification assay in parallel (Promega). No significant effect on keratinocyte viability was observed up to 300 U/ml of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 1B).",

HaCaT cells were treated with increasing doses of IFN-\u03b2 for 24 h, followed by RNA extraction and RT-qPCR to assess IFITM mRNA expression levels. IFITM1, 2 and 3 mRNA expression was increased by IFN-\u03b2 in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1C). It appeared that the magnitude of IFITM1 induction by IFN-\u03b2 treatment was higher than the levels of IFITM2 and IFITM3 induction.

It has been previously reported that S-protein mediated entry of SARS-CoV is broadly restricted by the IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins [25]. Using a SARS-CoV S-protein pseudotyped lentivirus [39] as a positive control, we demonstrate a similar restriction of SARS-CoV infection mediated by IFITM proteins in HeLa cell lines (Fig. 3C).",

Since IFITM2 expression appeared to have no effect on HPV16 infectivity, we focused only on IFITM1 and IFITM3. The levels of target gene knockdown were determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4A). Although IFITM1 and IFITM3 show some sequence homology, no off target effects were noted by shRNA knockdown (Fig. S2). Interestingly, knockdown of IFITM1 or IFITM3 expression had no effect on HPV16-LucF infection (Fig. 4B).

Given the consistent effects of IFITM1 overexpression on HPV16 infection in primary keratinocytes, we determined whether IFITM1 altered the kinetics of HPV16 L1 major capsid protein degradation. HFKs were inoculated with HPV16 virions containing full-length viral genomes for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to allow for virus attachment but not internalization. Internalization was initiated by shifting the cells to 37\u00b0C for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h. At the indicated time points, the cells were trypsinized to remove non-internalized virus, then harvested for HPV16 L1 western blotting. Intriguingly, HFKs overexpressing IFITM1 exhibited delayed L1 degradation compared to the empty vector control, showing reduced accumulation of the 22 and 12 kD degradation products as early as 2 hpi (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we previously reported that the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), delays the degradation of HPV16 L1 capsid proteins during entry in a strikingly similar manner as IFITM1 overexpression [41]. Further, 3-MA also significantly enhanced HPV16 infection in HFKs [41]. As Feeley et al. demonstrated a role for IFITM3 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion during influenza A virus infection [36], our results imply that IFITM1 overexpression may alter cellular compartments in a similar manner that partially protects the HPV capsid from degradation in lysosomes and autolysosomes.",

            "text": "It is well known that innate immune responses are critical for protecting host cells from early establishment of virus infection. Following recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, type I IFN production is induced which triggers localized antiviral activities through various ISGs [48]. Here we report the role of type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, in restricting HPV entry into human keratinocytes. As shown in Figure 1, IFN-\u03b2 significantly inhibited HPV infection at much lower concentrations than IFN-\u03b1, while IFN-\u03b1 efficiently induced ISGs in human keratinocytes. One explanation for these differential effects is that IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 induce different groups of ISGs. Microarray analysis of cells treated with either IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 identified more than 20 candidate genes whose mRNA levels are selectively induced by IFN-\u03b2 but not IFN-\u03b1. These most notably include PKR, ISG-56 (IFIT1), ISG-58 (IFIT5), and HIF-1\u03b1, while the remaining genes lack annotated antiviral activity [49]. An unbiased analysis of genes preferentially induced by IFN-\u03b2 in keratinocytes may be useful in identifying candidate host factors that restrict HPV entry and replication. Alternatively, the differences in HPV infectivity may be due to differences in interruption of cell proliferation triggered after IFN exposure. IFN-\u03b2 exhibits strong anti-proliferative effects on human cancer cells at concentrations far lower than those for IFN-\u03b1 [50]. As we previously revealed that HPV requires host cell mitosis for virus entry [43], disrupting cell proliferation by IFN-\u03b2 may interfere with HPV infection.",

            "text": "IFITM proteins inhibit several RNA viruses that rely on low-pH in late endosomes or lysosomes for virus entry [22], [23]. It is well established that HPV requires these acidified compartments for uncoating and egress from the endosomal pathway [33]\u2013[35], thus IFITMs would serve as an attractive candidate for HPV restriction. Using various epithelial cell lines and primary keratinocytes expressing IFITMs, we show that HPV infection is surprisingly enhanced by IFITM1 and IFITM3 overexpression (Fig. 2). A similar enhancement has been observed with pseudovirions expressing the entry proteins of several arenaviruses and a retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) [24]. Thus, our and previous results [24] suggest that resistant viruses may take advantage of endocytic trafficking altered by overexpression of IFITM. Additionally, we demonstrate that IFITM1, 2 and 3 did not inhibit infection of two other DNA viruses, Ad5 and HCMV, whereas infection of SARS-CoV, a positive control, was broadly restricted (Fig. 3). The low pH of the endocytic pathway is required for adenovirus infection [51], [52]. However, it has been reported that adenovirus egress from endosomes is rapid and likely mediated by penetration in early endosomes but not late endosomes [45], [53]. Entry mechanisms of HCMV vary depending on different virus strains and the host cell types [54]. While HCMV entry into fibroblasts is mediated by pH-independent fusion at the host cell plasma membrane [55], virus entry into epithelial cells requires endocytosis and pH dependent fusion within endosomes [46]. Because we utilized an epithelial cell model (HeLa), HCMV entry might occur along the endocytic pathway, although the exact point of egress has still yet to be determined. Nevertheless, the tested DNA viruses, HPV, HCMV, and Ad5, similarly require endocytosis and low pH for entry into host cells, and are not inhibited by IFITMs. Further comparative studies of larger panels of DNA viruses, with various entry mechanisms, might aid in defining the role of IFITMs during DNA virus infection and clarify the differential routes of endosome trafficking in RNA and DNA virus entry into host cells.",

            "text": "Our results provide the first evidence that IFITMs do not restrict and potentially enhance infection of DNA viruses (Fig. 2). Overexpression of IFITM1 delayed L1 capsid protein degradation in primary keratinocytes (Fig. 5), which may explain an enhancement of virus infection by IFITM1. Further investigations into how viruses bypass IFITM restriction may provide more detailed mechanistic insights into virus trafficking and help clarify productive routes of infectious entry. Taken together, our results suggest that HPV and other DNA viruses may have evolved to avoid IFITM1, 2 and 3 restriction during entry into host cells.",
