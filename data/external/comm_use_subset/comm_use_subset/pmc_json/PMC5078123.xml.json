As of September 27, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1806 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 643 related deaths [4]. The majority (~80 %) of MERS cases occurred in Saudi Arabia [4], where several hospital outbreaks happened [5, 6] with 45 % of all cases taking place within healthcare facilities [7]. The outbreak in the Republic of Korea illustrated the global threat of this disease. It started in May 2015 and resulted from a case with travel history to the Arabian Peninsula [4]. Human-to-human transmission occurred to close contacts [family members, other patients and healthcare workers (HCWs)] and led to 186 cases of MERS-CoV infections with 19 % fatality rate. In our hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh, an outbreak of MERS disease occurred in August to September 2015 [4], led to significant disruption of hospital functions and resulted in 130 MERS cases [8] with 63 patients requiring ICU admission. The outbreak was attributed to crowding, movement of infected but undiagnosed patients and breaches in infection prevention and control practices [4]. Details of the hospital outbreak have been published elsewhere [8].",

The Department also provided coverage to boarding patients in the 15-bed Resuscitation Area in the Emergency Department (ED). The hospital had also an 8-bed Burn ICU. The ICUs were operated as closed units with 24-h, 7-day onsite coverage by board-certified critical care intensivists [9]. Normally, 5 medical teams covered the units during the day with each team consisting of one intensivist consultant, one registrar/fellow and 1\u20133 residents. The nurse-to-patient ratio in all the ICUs was mostly 1:1. One certified respiratory therapist covered a maximum of six ventilated patients. Additionally, the department had a rapid response team, which covered the hospital wards and was activated according to predefined criteria and is covered by a sixth separate team [10].",

For intubated patients, ventilator care was provided by specialized respiratory therapists and included using closed endotracheal suctioning systems which were changed every 72 h or as clinically indicated [12], changing the ventilator circuits in between patients or if they became soiled or damaged [12], and using heat and moisture exchangers which were changed every 7 days or when visibly soiled [12]. Due to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms and prior cases of influenza and MERS infection in the hospital, droplet precautions were applied to all ICU patients since February 2012 [11]. Sporadic cases of MERS cases have been managed in our ICU since February 2013. The characteristics, management and outcomes of the initial MERS cases managed in our unit were described previously [3]. All HCWs were required to undergo fit testing for the N95 respirators (Table 1).\n",

The respiratory samples were routinely obtained by blind deep tracheal aspirate in intubated patients. In the hospital biosafety level 2 laboratory, MERS-CoV screening was performed by real-time reverse-transcription (rRT) PCR on respiratory samples by checking for the upstream E protein genome (Roche Modular Dx Coronavirus) and infection confirmation by detecting the open reading frame 1a genome (MERS-CoV kit from TIB Molbiol) [14]. Laboratory workers were fit-tested and applied N95 respirators while handing respiratory samples. Positive samples were sent to the Saudi Ministry of Health reference laboratory for confirmation.

Among our 63 critically ill MERS patients, the initial MERS-CoV testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs in 29 and deep tracheal aspirates in the rest (n = 34). In the first sample, MERS-CoV was detected in only 6/29 (20.7 %) nasopharyngeal samples and 26/34 (76.5 %) deep tracheal aspirates. After initial negative or equivocal nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 23), a second nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 16 patients (positive in 37.5 %) and deep tracheal aspirate in 5 (positive in 100 %). Our microbiology laboratory extended its working hours and prioritized testing samples coming from the ICU and the rest of the hospital. The number of MERS-CoV tests performed on ICU patients went up from an average of 1.5 before to 5.3 per day during the outbreak with a maximum of 19 tests on September 4, 2015. In patients with suspected MERS and negative rRT-PCR, the test was repeated after 1\u20132 days. There was a general consensus among our intensivists that three negative lower respiratory samples and low clinical pretest probability were needed to exclude MERS-CoV infection.

Its presenting symptoms overlap with those of other severe acute respiratory illnesses and include fever (71 %), cough (68 %), dyspnea (66 %) and diarrhea (32 %) [17], often in older adults with preexisting chronic comorbidities [17, 18]. Common laboratory abnormalities include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes [17]. The initial chest radiographs show minimal abnormality to extensive bilateral infiltrates [17]. Unfortunately, many frontline physicians are unfamiliar with the MERS case definition, probably because cases are sporadic, leading to delayed or even missed diagnosis. Delayed recognition may lead to exposing many other patients, visitors and HCWs to the infection as it was the case in our hospital. MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission is thought to be via respiratory droplets, and contact spread is suspected [19]. In Korea, the delayed diagnosis of an infected traveler to the Arabian Peninsula led to 186 MERS cases and resulted in intra- and inter-hospital transmission [20]. In Saudi Arabia, 45 % of MERS cases were acquired in the healthcare setting with 12 % of all cases being HCWs [7]. Therefore, taking a detailed history, knowing MERS case definitions, standardizing pneumonia workup, obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens [21] and implementing droplet isolation for suspected cases are crucial interventions to break the transmission chain in the healthcare setting.",

During an outbreak, clinical engineering should have expedient plans to convert standard rooms. Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may be a solution [16]. Outbreaks can lead to significant increase in the need for ICU beds, but may simultaneously reduce the available beds. The SARS outbreak in Toronto led to 10-day closures of 35 ICU beds, which represented 38 % of the tertiary-care university medical-surgical ICU beds in Toronto [16]. Hence, hospitals should always have plans to augment ICU bed capacity, such as by transforming general wards. The ability of any hospital to deal with an infectious outbreak is decided by the availability of ICU beds [23].",

MERS-CoV patients requiring ICU admission have higher viral load than other MERS patients [24]. Aerosol-generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation, suctioning and bronchoscopy, add to the exposure and transmission risk [25]. Extended bedside care is needed for MERS patients due to the requirement of organ support such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, continuous renal replacement therapy, prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [2, 3]. In this study, we observed an increase in the nurse-to-patient ratio from 1:1.2 to approximately 1:0.8 during the outbreak. The SARS epidemic was also associated with increases in the nurse-to-patient ratio [26]. Stay in the ICU can last for weeks [3], which we observed. Additionally, MERS-CoV shedding can be prolonged and may last for >30 days [27].",

During the SARS outbreak in Toronto, a survey of HCWs found that >60 % of respondents reported SARS-related concern for their own or their family\u2019s health [29]. Moreover, 29 % of respondents had probable emotional distress [29]. During our outbreak, many ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS. Staff safety should be a primary goal in a hospital infectious outbreak. Pregnant and immunocompromised staff should be redeployed to lower-risk areas [30], which we did. Proper exposure management should be pre-planned, which was determined in our IDEP. N95 respirator fit testing should be performed at hiring of new staff and done for all other staff before any outbreak. Although fit testing was required for all staff, many did not have fit testing done. However, in response to the outbreak, fit testing was performed to all staff and powered air-purifying respirators were provided to those who failed fit testing. Strict infection prevention and control practices should be implemented and audited. This was performed in our units. Repetitive training is recommended [31]. Despite intensive infection prevention practices, 3 of our ICU staff had MERS-CoV infection during the outbreak likely due to suboptimal PPE use while intubating yet undiagnosed patients.",

Although noninvasive ventilation use was discouraged, it was used in 12 patients. The WHO considers noninvasive ventilation an option in selected MERS cases [15]. It should be used as a short trial without delaying intubation if unsuccessful [15]. Moreover, high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula may be another option [15, 34]; however, the associated transmission risk as a result of aerosol generation is unknown. Systematic corticosteroids, ribavirin and interferon were avoided as they have no proven benefit [15, 35]. Our MERS patients had high mortality (63 %). The previously reported mortality of MERS patients who had critical illness ranged from 58 to 84 % [2, 3, 18]. None of our HCWs who developed MERS died, which was gratifying to our staff.",
