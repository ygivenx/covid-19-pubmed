            "text": "It has been noticed since long that the RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a significantly biased nucleotide composition [1]. The A-numbers reach 35.1% and the C-count is particularly low at 18.1% [2]. This A-pressure is rather strong and even influences the amino acid composition of the HIV-1 proteins with a preference for residues that are encoded by A-rich codons [3]. Two evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. First, the biased nucleotide composition may be imposed over evolutionary times by a distinct mutational pattern of the viral polymerase. HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase copies the RNA genome and indeed, at least under some conditions, introduces C-to-U mutations that result in G-to-A changes in the RNA genome [4, 5]. Alternatively, the cellular Apobec enzymes may have edited the HIV-1 RNA genome by G-to-A hypermutagenesis [6\u20138]. A second scenario entertains a functional role for the A-rich RNA genome. For instance, we previously suggested that this A-bias may create a distinctive signature that is recognized by the viral Gag protein during selective packaging of the viral RNA genome amongst a multitude of cellular transcripts [9]. There is some recent support for the latter scenario. The HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag protein was reported to undergo a switch in RNA-binding mode during virion assembly: from recognizing GU-rich sequences as NC monomer to packaging of A-rich sequences by Gag multimers as part of the assembling virion [10, 11]. It was also proposed that the particular nucleotide composition of the invading HIV-1 RNA is critical for reverse transcription [12], that two A-rich domains within the Gag open reading frame direct translation events [13] and that it is detected by the innate immune system in human cells [14, 15]. Analysis of the A-richness is further complicated by other nucleotide pressures, e.g. strong suppression of the CG dinucleotide [16, 17], codon usage bias that is possibly coupled to restriction by the cellular Schlafen 11 protein [18] and a certain bias for codon-pairs [19].",

            "text": "Thus, it seems important to probe the replication capacity and molecular properties of modified HIV-1 variants with an altered A-count of the RNA genome. However, it is quite risky to massively increase or decrease the number of A nucleotides in the HIV-1 RNA genome because of the likelihood that multiple important sequence elements will be affected. For instance, packaging signals in the viral RNA are known to extend into the Gag open reading frame [20] and the HIV-1 genome is riddled with regulatory splice signals [21\u201323]. Here, we present a first conservative attempt to create such A-up/down HIV-1 variants. Several precautions were made to increase the chance of generating replication-competent virus variants. First, only silent codon changes were allowed in order not to change the encoded viral proteome. Second, only a small genome segment of 498 nucleotides was chosen for this round of A up/down mutagenesis, which represents some 5.5% of the complete genomic RNA. Third, we have chosen a relatively \u201crelaxed\u201d part of the HIV-1 genome for mutagenesis, e.g. a domain that does not encode overlapping open reading frames or important regulatory RNA signals, in order to minimize the chances of inducing replication defects. Fourth and likely most important, we implemented a new approach to select functionally neutral base substitutions, a method that we will call phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis (PIM). The resulting viruses were tested in single cycle assays that score the early phase (infectivity) and late phase (virus production) of the HIV-1 replication cycle and virus spread was measured in a transformed T cell line and primary T cells.",

We choose the fragment encoded between the restriction sites Bcl1 (2512) and Bst1107I (3015) in the pLAI molecular clone to facilitate easy cloning. PIM used the sequence of 675 HIV-1 subtype B isolates present in the Los Alamos sequence compendium [33]. All sequences were aligned with the prototype LAI isolate and we scored the number of A, C, U and G nucleotides per position. Insertions and deletions, usually a multiple of 3-nt codons, were ignored. To restrict the mutagenesis to silent codon changes, we focused on 3rd codon positions. We selected natural sequence variation that differs from the LAI sequence for introduction in the LAI genome, but with the following thresholds. The Max variant incorporated all possible changes from a regular LAI residue into A when observed in at least 5 HIV-1 isolates (0.7%). This led to the introduction of 34 A nucleotides (Table 1). As there is more room for A-removal, we decided to make two mutants, the Low and Min variants by removing 42 and 69 A nucleotides, respectively (Table 1). Changes from A to another nucleotide were incorporated when present in at least 5 or 20 of the 675 isolates (0.7\u20133.0%, respectively).\n",

Of the 498-nucleotide encoded by the Bcl1-Bst1107I fragment, the wt LAI clone contains 200 A nucleotides (40.2%), which was raised to 46.9% for Max and reduced to 31.7 and 26.3% for the Low and Min mutants. A bigger shift is obtained for A-removal than A-addition, which is related to two simple facts. First, the wt starting sequence contains very many As that can be removed. Second, A-addition calls for a specific mutation (N-to-A), whereas A-removal can be towards any other nucleotide (U, C or G). As expected, a concomitant decrease (Max) and increase (Low and Min) was apparent for the non-A nucleotides, although with a non-random distribution. For instance, As were replaced in the Min mutant for G (58\u00d7), C (6\u00d7) or U (5\u00d7). In toto, G-to-A and especially A-to-G changes dominate the mutations chosen, which thus reflects the natural mutational bias of HIV-1 isolates. We believe that this trend is dictated by the characteristics of the codon table. There are eight 4-codon groups where the silent third base can be any nucleotide, but there are also five 2-codon groups where the silent third base change concerns a G/A choice. Another reason for the frequent occurrence of A-to-G over A-to-U/C changes is the observation that transitions are much less frequently observed in HIV-1 evolution than transversions [34, 35]. In fact, we realize that more dramatic silent mutations are possible for the two 6-codon groups, e.g. one could change the CGU codon for Arg silently into AGA and create 2 more As (or remove them in the reversed scenario). We did not implement such multiple changes because they were never observed in the pol gene segment of natural virus isolates (results not shown).",

For instance, studies in diverse viral systems reported an impact on the viral fitness by changes in the dinucleotide count, the codon usage or the codon pair bias [15, 19, 36\u201338]. As example, we inspected the occurrence of the CG dinucleotide, which is strongly discriminated against in HIV-1 RNA [39]. CG occurs only once in the wt pol gene fragment, whereas the GC dinucleotide occurs 10\u00d7, underscoring the strong CG discrimination. The single CG was removed in the Max mutant by a C-to-A mutation, but 4 additional CGs were introduced in the Min mutant, all by A-to-G changes. More changes are likely avoided because other virus isolates also exhibit CG-discrimination. As a control, we also looked at the UA dinucleotide that does not have biased count in HIV-1 RNA [39]. The wt pol gene segment encodes 38 UAs, which goes up to 45 in the Max mutant and down to 20 in the Min mutant. Similar changes are expected for the other genome parameters. Although all changes occur in nature, their clustered appearance is unnatural and may impose problems.",

This is reflected in a change in the \u201ceffective number of codons\u201d [40] or ENC value (results not shown). Closer inspection indicated that the expected nt-changes were present, e.g. towards the use of A-ending codons in the Max mutant.

To underscore this scenario, we in fact scored a complete absence of G-ending codons at these three positions in natural virus isolates. The Gly codon group (GGN) favors replacement of the terminal A by C and not by G, which may indicate another local sequence constraint (Fig. 1). \n",

The pyrimidine skew (UC) is not at all affected by the A-introduction/removal. Perhaps surprisingly, the CG and UG skews do show a small up-effect for Max and stronger down-effect for Low and Min. These trends also reveal the preferential exchange of A by G (transition) over C/U (transversion). This leads to preferential G depletion in Max, such that the CG and UG skews move up a bit.

Nevertheless, quite remarkable and opposing movements were observed for the three mutants within the HIV\u2013SIV group in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 6). Low and Min moved gradually away from the LAI ancestor and Min migrated further as expected because of the more severe A-minimization. The high bootstrap value of 100 at the branching of Low and Min was also anticipated because Min builds further on the Low mutant by removing even more As. The Tamura-Nei distance between LAI and Low (0.099) was nearly doubled for the LAI-Min comparison (0.180). However, both mutants are confidently clustered within subtype B (bootstrap value 91 for the subtype B cluster), with LAI as the closest relative. This result is not unexpected as the PIM approach used subtype B sequence variation to design the changes in the LAI prototype strain.",

This result was somewhat unexpected as the PIM approach uses natural subtype B sequences to design the changes. The Tamura-Nei distance for LAI-Max is 0.074, which is in fact less than the distance between LAI and the Low/Min variants. Nevertheless, the A-addition in Max has a larger impact on the positioning in the tree topology. The A-addition in Max does in fact slightly reduce the distance to the SIV cluster (LAI-N is 0.215 and Max-N is 0.176), which is likely due to the fact that A-nucleotides are frequently present at identical positions both in Max and the more distant SIV isolates. We previously reported that a similar A-pressure is apparent in all HIV-1 and SIV strains and subtypes [2].",

For instance, such a phylogenetic approach has been instrumental in the dissection of critical RNA structures that support HIV-1 replication [41\u201343]. We now used the sequence information available for natural HIV-1 isolates in the construction of quite massively altered virus genome segments in which the number of A nucleotides was increased from 40.1 to 46.8% or decreased to 26.4%. It is important to stress that although all PIM-mutations were selected based on their occurrence in natural virus isolates, they usually are present as individual mutations, and certainly not clustered as in the PIM-mutated viruses. We report that the designed virus variants are fully replication-competent, demonstrating the power of this PIM as conservative approach. For instance, although the CG dinucleotide is strongly underrepresented in HIV-1 RNA, we could raise the local CG dinucleotide count in the pol segment from 1 to 5 without imposing a significant replication deficit. Other mutagenesis approaches resulted in a significant loss of HIV-1 replication fitness, although the results are difficult to compare because of differences in target gene and extent of the mutated segment.",

Given these promising results, one could consider a more complete rewiring strategy for the 9 kb genome, although it remains a quite elaborate and costly synthetic biology project. Such a holistic approach clearly remains a high-risk procedure as one has to avoid the mutational inactivation of critical replication signals, e.g. the numerous splicing signals (donors, acceptors, enhancers, silencers) or the introduction of toxic signals (e.g. A-addition will frequently introduce stop codons). PIM therefore seems the ideal strategy because all selected mutations have been repeatedly tested and approved in natural isolates. Of course the combination of PIM-assigned changes that are derived from different viruses may still become deleterious, adding to the high-risk. If replication of such a rewired construct is hampered, it would be important to study the interaction of HIV-1 RNA and DNA with components of the innate immune system. One could also use spontaneous virus evolution to repair and thus identify the mutations that most seriously hamper virus replication [44, 45].",

Nevertheless, such virus variants are fully replication-competent. In other words, we have mapped here the limits of sequence space relative to A-richness in a small pol gene segment that gives rise to a functional HIV-1 genome. We obviously cannot exclude the possibility that the A-count is more critical in other parts of the HIV-1 genome, although A-pressure is intensely present across the genome [2]. This information seems valuable for the design of replication-competent, but attenuated virus variants with numerous mutations that restrict easy reversion to the wt sequence. Such genetically stable hypermutated virus variants could be considered a novel strategy towards a safe live-attenuated vaccine candidate.",

Using PIM we dramatically altered the phylogenetic position of this LAI variant from within the subtype B cluster to a \u201cprimordial\u201d position at the base of the complete M group. However, the Low and Min mutants were in fact equipped with more mutations than Max, but apparently without affecting the core subtype B characteristics. The observation that only the Max mutant lost the subtype B characteristics is intriguing. This differential behavior may hint at what the key determinants are for the subtype-specific signatures. We reason that the key subtype signature is formed by those non-A nucleotides (mostly G) at silent codon positions that fluctuate towards A in other virus isolates as these changes were used to design Max. The driving force behind these decisive changes is likely the striking preponderance of G-to-A changes in HIV-1 evolution [7, 49\u201351]. As a consequence, other characteristics like genetically stable A and non-A positions and non-silent codon alterations seem less critical for the subtype signature. A related phenomenon has been reported previously for the characteristics that underlie differences among viruses from distinct patient risk groups, in particular homosexual men versus drug users [52]. When silent and non-silent codon positions were analyzed separately, it became apparent that the former deliver the decisive HIV-1 genome characteristics. Although surprising, this finding may suggest that selection at the amino acid level is not the primary driving force for the independent evolutionary behavior of the viral genes.",

At the same time, the full replication potential of the mutant viruses indicates the success of the novel PIM strategy, which proposes silent mutations only when the new nucleotide is repeatedly observed in natural virus isolates. Quite surprisingly, a phylogenetic survey indicated that the mutant with a maximal A-count moved its position to a \u201cprimordial\u201d position at the base of all M group HIV-1 subtypes.
