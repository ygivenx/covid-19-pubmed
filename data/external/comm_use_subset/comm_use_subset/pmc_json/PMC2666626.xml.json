To facilitate these, patients must nominate a \"guardian\" \u2013 usually a close family member. The guardian must then accept responsibility for ensuring that the patient takes the right sort of nutritious food, checks medication compliance and makes sure the patient is present for follow-up.

A voluntary guardian system might well be acceptable to United Kingdom patients and have the potential to favourably alter clinical outcome. It is the norm in antenatal and intrapartum care for United Kingdom patients to be accompanied by a \"guardian\" (usually their partner).

The clinical outcome in people with diabetes, arthritis, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) depends on good nutrition, medication compliance and follow-up care according to management guidelines [14]. Again the experience of mentoring suggests that developing and formalizing support for patients may improve outcome. There is research evidence to suggest that clinical outcomes in cancer care can be enhanced if patients are \"mentored\": supported by volunteers or fellow sufferers [15]. This support could be formalized to include a \"guardian\" commitment to provide good nutrition and assist with medication compliance and follow-up appointments.

The situation in Malawi is very different, because of the high and visible presence of infectious diseases affecting the population.

In Malawi, clinical officers make direct and immediate contact with their public health outreach colleagues if they suspect a water source is contaminated or an open case of TB is present in the community.

Many patients are reluctant to turn to mainstream health facilities, such as their own GP, and turn instead to more secretive and less personal forms of care, such as genitourinary medicine clinics. In Malawi, HIV testing is available in Health Ministry clinics and is voluntary, linked with counselling, hence VCT. \"VCT\" has entered the everyday vocabulary of Malawians because clinics display signs and an ongoing poster campaign helps to dispel stigma. Crucially, testing is available on demand with the result available quickly, sometimes on the same day. It is remarkable that a developed, resource-rich health care system such as the United Kingdom's NHS still persists with the archaic practice of keeping patients waiting at least a week to receive a result.

The United Kingdom has recently learnt the painful lesson that increased monetary input does not directly correlate with improved health outcome.
