In Thailand, EEHV infection accounts for an estimated over 80% or more of elephant calf fatalities each year. Eight species of EEHV, including EEHV1A, EEHV1B, and EEHV2-7, have been identified; they are collectively classified as members of the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae, genus Proboscivirus [4]. Although adult elephants also appear susceptible to EEHV, mortality from EEHV-HD has mostly been observed in young animals, especially those 1\u20138 years old [1, 5]. Most elephants that succumbed to EEHV-HD presented clinically with decreased thrombocytes and monocytes in their blood [5\u20139]. The marked reduction of peripheral blood thrombocytes (thrombocytopenia) and monocytes (monocytopenia) can, therefore, provide a prognostic hematological parameter for EEHV-HD cases [1, 5]. While thrombocytopenia in EEHV-HD cases is hypothesized to be a mechanism associated with consumption coagulopathies [5], the pathomechanisms underlying monocytopenia in EEHV-HD cases remain poorly understood.",

During innate immune responses, monocytes/macrophages sense and promote inflammation by producing type 1 interferon and secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, in order to recruit effecter cells to clear pathogens [15\u201317]; while in adaptive immune response, they serve as antigen-presenting cells prime to T lymphocytes [18]. Experimental inoculation of monocytes with dengue virus in vitro increased apoptosis of virus-infected cells and induced production of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [10, 11]. Apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages in dengue virus infection is believed to be an immunological process that inhibits virus replication in infected patients [10, 11]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages in cases of EEHV infection.",

The immunohistochemistry of the tissues was investigated employing a minor modification of the avidin\u2013biotin complex (ABC) method, as described previously [20]. Briefly, the FFPE sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and microwaved for 30 minutes in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Afterward, sections were incubated for 5 minutes with 3%H2O2 in methanol, and then blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Tween-20. Thereafter, they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours with one of two primary antibodies: a mouse monoclonal anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) (1:200; EMD Millipore, CA, USA) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-EEHV gB[6]. After washing three times with PBS, sections were incubated for 45 minutes at RT with either biotinylated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). Section then were washed and incubated with peroxidise coupled ABC (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Antibody binding was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB)-H2O2 for 5 minutes at RT followed by counterstaining with Mayer\u00b4s hemalum. For each antibody, a normal mouse or rabbit serum was used instead of a primary antibody. Slides were observed and photos were taken under a light microscope. Three independent observers scored the immunohistochemically positive cells for Iba-1 and EEHV gB antibodies in selected organs; samples were rated as 0 (no positive cells), 1 (1\u201310% positive cells), 2 (11\u201330% positive cells), 3 (31\u201350% positive cells), or 4 (>50% positive cells).

These results suggested that Iba-1 positive monocytes from blood vessels infiltrated the inflamed tissues of the internal organs, despite the fact that fewer EEHV gB antigens were detected. Therefore, it is possible that the EEHV1A infection and co-infections of EEHV1A and 4 in elephant blood leukocytes or tissues induce expression of chemoattractive mediators that might play a role in the movement of monocytes out of the blood circulation. Hence, immunolabeling of EEHV gB was low, while immunolabeling for Iba-1 was high. On the other hand, despite a clear increase in Iba-1 positive cells in the internal organs of EEHV4-HD calves, the EEHV4 gB immunolabeling positive cells observed in the tissues of EEHV4-HD calves also increased (Fig 3).

Despite some studies observing EEHV genomes and antigens in the monocytes/macrophages of EEHV-HD calves, and postulating that these cells are carriers for virus dissemination [6, 19], the exact roles the monocytes/macrophages play in cases of either acute infection and subsequent fatality or persistent EEHV-infection are unclear. Moreover, it is not known why monocytopenia has been observed in some cases of fatal EEHV-HD infection [5, 6, 9], or in some episodes during persistent EEHV infection [7, 8]. The present study observed for the first time apoptosis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in acute cases of fatal EEHV-HD infection and in persistent EEHV4 infections. Moreover, phagocyted apoptotic cells, together with increased trafficking of blood monocytes to the inflamed tissues, may cause monocytopenia in the cases of acute or persistent EEHV infection in Asian elephants. Furthermore, this study has shown that the virus-laden blood mononuclear cells likely serve as vehicles for disseminating EEHV, rather than as a viral reservoir, during both acute and persistent EEHV infections in Asian elephants.",

            "text": "Originating from the bone marrow progenitor cells, monocytes are trafficked via the blood stream to the peripheral tissues where they differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells, and then play an essential role in immune defense mechanisms [15, 17, 18, 27\u201329]. However, monocytes/macrophages also contribute to bystander tissue destruction during some infections and inflammatory diseases [15, 29]. The magnitude of monocyte/macrophage infiltration in inflamed tissues can, therefore, be used as a marker for determining severity of the lesions [15, 17, 30]. Previous studies have shown that viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), infect monocytes/macrophages and cause their necrosis and apoptosis, both in vivo and in vitro [31\u201334]. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death characterized by decreased nuclear and cellular volume, nuclear fragmentation, and plasma membrane blebbing, leaded to cell fragments called apoptotic bodies; it can be classified into extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [35, 36]. There can be substantial crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, triggered in response to activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which usually result from viral infections [35, 37\u201339]. Monocytes are non-dividing cells with a short half-life that circulate in the blood and make viral replication difficult or almost impossible [40]; as such, apoptosis of peripheral blood monocytes has been suggested to be one of the defense mechanisms against viral infection [41, 42]. In the present study, ultrastructural photomicrographs of EEHV viral particles in peripheral blood monocytes of persistent EEHV4-infected calves and positive signals of TUNEL assay in monocytes of the EEHV-HD calves suggest that EEHV infection of monocytes seems to be non productive and result in apoptosis of the EEHV-infected cells. Non productive infection and apoptosis of the peripheral blood monocytes has been observed in infection with other betaherpesviruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [43, 44]. Infection of peripheral blood monocytes with HCMV leads to induction of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma-1 (Bcl-1), as causes delay of apoptosis in the infected cells [12, 45, 46]. The delay apoptosis of HCMV-infected monocytes allow these cells to bridge the 48\u201372 hours viability gate, so then they can differentiate into mature phenotypes required for HCMV persistence, such as macrophages or dendritic cells [12, 47]. In contrast to the present study, apoptosis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells was predominantly observed in the fatal cases of EEHV1A-HD and EEHV4-HD infections and in a lower extent of persistent EEHV4-infection. Despite these findings may support the hypothesis indicating the functional role of monocytes in inhibiting the viral replication, as seen in the infection of dengue virus, PRRSV and FIPV [10, 11, 33, 34], it remains unknown whether infection of EEHV in monocytes causes delay apoptosis. Moreover, since positive signals of TUNEL assay were also observed in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood monocytes, it is possible that in addition to the apoptotic bodies that seen in EEHV-infected monocytes, apoptotic bodies derived from the EEHV-infected cells may also had phagocytosed by the phagocytic cells, such as monocytes. Then, these cells may serve as carrier for virus dissemination to other organs. However, to define precise pathomechanisms of apoptosis in the EEHV-infected elephant cells, further studies are required.",

TNF-\u03b1 related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF superfamily, has been shown to contribute to the induction of apoptosis in several types of tumor or virus-infected cells [35, 48, 49]. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to enhance vascular hyperpermeability in dengue hemorrhagic fever [27, 50]. This study showed that TNF-\u03b1 mRNA up-regulated in the persistent EEHV4-infected calves suggesting that during EEHV infection, TNF-\u03b1 not only contributed to apoptosis of the EEHV-infected cells, but also enhanced transmigration of leukocytes out of the blood vessels. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that migration of peripheral blood monocytes out of the blood vessels is also associated with the monocytopenia observed in the EEHV-infected elephants. We would like to stress the fact that monocytopenia observed in the EEHV-HD cases was not due to the homing of monocytes/macrophages in the spleen since the Iba-1 immunolabeling positive cells in the spleen was not differed between the EEHV-HD cases and the EEHV-negative controls. Meanwhile, we did not explore the decrease of monocytic production in bone marrow in the present study. Thus, it remains unclear if EEHV infections possess an impact on monocytic production in bone marrow. Though, since studies have suggested that recruitment of monocytes from peripheral blood vessels into tissue parenchyma might provide a pathway for pathogen dissemination, such as observed in the HCMV infection [28, 51], it is likely that while EEHV circulates in the blood stream by infecting monocytes, it gets into the target organs by infecting or transmigrating through vascular endothelia, as shown by viral inclusions in the endothelial cells of some infected tissues.",

Studies have shown that IFN-\u03b3 attenuates viral infections in humans and animal models [52\u201354]. However, despite a previous report that showed that IFN-\u03b3 response in the latent EEHV-infected elephants were largely from the CD4+ T lymphocytes, and were prone to respond to EEHV antigens [55], it remains unclear whether CD4+ T lymphocytes are also targeted by EEHV. The up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in the persistent EEHV4-infected elephant PMBCs that this study observed further demonstrated the important role of type 1 interferon during persistent EEHV infections in Asian elephants.",

Hence, further study may be required to support the hypotheses proposed in the present study. Second, infection of elephant blood monocytes with EEHV could not be investigated using cell cultures, as the virus has yet to be successfully cultivated. Third, using both immunofluorescene and immunohistochemistry, we failed to demonstrate whether T and B lymphocytes were targeted by the EEHV. In summary, the present study hypothesized that dissemination of EEHV through the target organs occurs via virus-laden blood monocytes, and that the dissemination of the virus is inhibited by host defense mechanisms, including apoptosis in the EEHV-infected cells and induction of type 1 interferon. Moreover, apoptosis, together with increased trafficking of blood monocytes to the inflamed tissues, may cause monocytopenia in the cases of acute or persistent EEHV infection in Asian elephants.",
