S. aureus is the most well-known of the species which produce hospital- and community-acquired infections, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus presenting a serious public health threat [1]. S. epidermidis is the sister species of S. aureus which often causes infection in immunocompromised individuals or those following damage to the epithelium. Both of them produce biofilm to protect themselves from host immune system and enhance their resistance to antibiotic chemotherapy [2]. The key component of the biofilm extracellular matrix in Staphylococci is polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) [3], an essential factor in biofilm formation composed of homopolymer of \u03b2-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The production of PIA depends on the expression of the icaADBC operon, and TcaR and IcaR are a weak and a strong negative regulator of transcription of the ica locus, respectively [4].",

The MarR family proteins function as regulators of protein expression and these regulated proteins confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, household disinfectants, organic solvent virulence factors, and oxidative stress agents [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The crystal structures of a number of MarR family proteins have been reported, including MarR from Escherichia coli\n[12], OhrR from Bacillis subtilis\n[13], MexR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[14], MarR from Xanthomonas campestris\n[15], SlyA from Salmonella typhimurium\n[16], AdcR from Streptococcus pneumonia\n[10] and TcaR, which is studied in this work, from S. epidermidis\n[17]. These structures revealed that MarR family proteins are all homodimers. The overall structure of each monomer could be divided into two functional domains, one is the dimerization domain and the other is the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domain. The N and the C-terminal \u03b1-helices (\u03b11, 5, 6) of one monomer interdigitate with those of the other monomer to produce dimerization interaction. In addition, the wHTH DNA binding domain is composed of \u03b12-\u03b13-\u03b14-\u03b2A-W1-\u03b2B which adopts the winged-helix-fold, and the amino acid sequences of this domain are highly conserved.",

            "text": "As the MarR-type proteins can act as positive, negative, or bifunctional regulators, TcaR also acts as a multi-functional regulator. It is not only as a regulatory factor to affect the transcription of icaADBC\n[4], the first regulator reported for cell wall-anchored proteins (SpA and sasF), but also as the regulator of sarS\n[18], [19]. We previously described the 3D structures of TcaR in its apo form and in complex with salicylate as well as several aminoglycoside and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [17]. In this research, comparison of the native TcaR structures and those in complexes indicated that the regulation mechanism involves a large conformational shift in the DNA binding lobe. Several antimicrobial compounds inhibited TcaR\u2013DNA interaction and further induced biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. In the present study, we found that TcaR could interact with ssDNA and the result demonstrated that TcaR shows a stronger preference toward GC-rich ssDNA than to dsDNA by using EMSA, CD, and Biacore experiments. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between TcaR and ssDNA still remains to be elucidated. In order to investigate the regulation mechanism of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR, we applied electron microscopy (EM) technique to reveal TcaR-ssDNA complex. Furthermore, we clarified the role of TcaR-ssDNA interaction by in vitro replication assay and in vivo plaque assay. Taken together, these results provide an in-depth investigation on the multiple functions of TcaR in S. epidermidis.",

We previously identified that TcaR most strongly interacts with IcaR DNA1 (a 33-mer pseudo-palindromic sequence containing consensus sequence TTNNAA) compared with other designed IcaR DNA fragments [17]. However, when using the sense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1S) and the antisense strand of IcaR DNA1 (IcaR DNA1A) (Figure 1A) as controls in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the result demonstrated that TcaR shows a stronger preferences toward ssDNA fragments (IcaR DNA1S and DNA1A) (Figure 1B). To determine the type and length of the TcaR-binding site on ssDNA, a series of GC-rich and AT-rich ssDNA segments were designed (Figure 1A) [20], [21]. Their TcaR binding ability was tested using EMSA. As shown in Figure 1C, TcaR does not significantly interact with 17-mer GC-rich (GC17) and AT-rich (AT17) ssDNA oligomers, but shows strong interaction with 33-mer GC-rich (GC33) and AT-rich (AT33) ssDNA sequences with a preference toward the 33-mer ssDNA sequence with a molar ratio of 1\u22361. Thus, we suggest that TcaR prefers binding to the 33-mer ssDNA.",

These results indicated that the minimal observed ssDNA fragment size to allow TcaR binding ranges between 17 to 25-mer; providing useful information for the design of a DNA fragment with precise length suitable for crystal packing. Up to now, only three MarR family protein complex structures have been reported, and the first one is complexed with dsDNA [13], [16], [22]. The second one is complexed with salicylate [12], [17], [22], [23] and we discovered the third case which is complexed with antibiotics [17]. We have already obtained TcaR-ssDNA crystals and collected X-ray diffraction data to 3.6 \u00c5 resolution at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), beamline BL12B2.

For the competition assay, the IcaR DNA1 probe was preincubated with TcaR (dimer) protein to allow formation of the dsDNA-TcaR complex prior to mixing with increasing amounts of single-stranded GC33 DNA. It has been known that ssDNA products have lower migration velocity compared to its dsDNA counterparts in polyacrylamide electrophoresis [24], [25]. As shown in Figure 1E, ssDNA, as a competitor, interfered the binding of TcaR to the dsDNA, suggesting a binding preference for ssDNA. To further confirm this result, IcaR DNA1 and GC33 ssDNA oligomers were mixed, and their interaction strengths with TcaR were compared using EMSA (Figure 1F). Findings indicated that increasing the concentration of TcaR produces a ssDNA band shift greater than that for dsDNA, confirming a stronger interaction between TcaR and ssDNA. Moreover, to investigate possible pH effect of ssDNA binding activity of TcaR, a series of buffers with increasing pH were tested for their potential interfere in TcaR-ssDNA binding. As shown in Figure 1G, the EMSA results showed that TcaR had a strongest affinity for GC33 at pH 8.0 and the affinity was reduced by decreasing pH. Consequently, the result indicates that the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR is pH-dependent.",

Results indicated that ampicillin also antagonized the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M. This result is consistent with the observation seen in SPR, as discussed below.

Increasing concentrations of TcaR were passed across a flow cell coated with ssDNA GC33 and the binding response was recorded as changes in response units (RU) after subtraction of the binding response for the reference flow cell. Figure 2A shows a representative sensorgram. Analysis of the sensorgram data indicates k\na for the interaction of TcaR with the ssDNA GC33 is 8.8\u00d7105 M\u22121 s\u22121; k\nd for the interaction of TcaR with the ssDNA GC33 is 9.5\u00d710\u22123 s\u22121 (Table 1). To investigate whether TcaR binds to different types and different lengths of DNA molecules, Biacore experiment was used to test the binding of TcaR to DNA fragments of biotin-labeled ssDNA and hairpin DNA duplex (IcaR DNA1). Consistent with previous observations in Fig. 1B, TcaR binds to ssDNA GC33 and ssDNA AT33 with the higher affinity and the association rates of TcaR to IcaR DNA1, and ssDNA GC17, ranging from 4.3\u00d7105 M\u22121 s\u22121 to 1.2\u00d7105 M\u22121 s\u22121, are much lower (shown in Figure 2B). However, when look at a wider range of DNA sizes, TcaR showed no detectable binding ability to ssDNA 8-mer GC8 but the highest binding ability to ssDNA GC99. The association rate with ssDNA GC99 is 36-fold higher than with ssDNA GC33, along with a 20-fold higher off-rate, suggested that cooperative binding of TcaR may contribute significantly in its ssDNA binding activity (Table 1). Interestingly, the association rate of GC33 ssDNA is two-times higher than IcaR DNA1, but the dissociation rate of IcaR DNA1 is the lowest compared to the DNA fragments tested in this study, suggesting different modes of interaction occurs in ssDNA-TcaR and dsDNA-TcaR complex (Figure 2B).",

The result shows that not all MarR family proteins have this ssDNA binding ability, thus pointing to the specific ssDNA-binding feature of TcaR. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that antibiotics appear to antagonize the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR (Figure 1I). Therefore, a measurement for the effect of kanamycin and ampicillin to the GC33 ssDNA binding affinity of TcaR is conducted using surface plasmon resonance to confirm the result. As seen in Figure 2D, the affinity between TcaR and GC33 ssDNA is shown by a decrease in RU values in the presence of antibiotics. This was especially apparent with kanamycin, which yield the lower binding capacity. Taken together, we demonstrate that TcaR shows a higher binding affinity to ssDNA than to dsDNA, and several antibiotics could regulate the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR.",

Because TcaR is known as a MarR family transcription regulator that binds to specific dsDNA sequence with the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domain, the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR may not be involved in transcription. In order to clarify the role of TcaR-viral ssDNA interaction, our approach is to examine it with in vitro replication. We used single-primed M13 replication assay to measure the ability of purified TcaR protein to convert a primed single-strand M13 template to the duplex form in a manner that requires processive DNA synthesis. As seen in Figure 5A, M13-based in vitro DNA replication assay showed that the addition of TcaR protein to the reaction mixture, and incubation for up to 30 min, resulted in almost no DNA replication activity compared to controls. This indicated that TcaR markedly inhibits DNA replication and that the mechanism of inhibition, at least in part, involves interaction with viral ssDNA. These results suggest a possible role for TcaR in bacteriophage resistance.",

            "text": "Since 1980, investigators have developed an increasing number of bacteriophage therapies for the treatment, or prophylaxis, of bacterial infectious diseases [29], [30], [31]. Reports have described that appropriately administered phages can treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, and S. aureus\n[32], [33], [34], [35]. Antibiotic resistance has become a global public health concern; thus investigators are extensively reevaluating phage therapies to fully exploit their antimicrobial potential [36], [37]. However, phages encounter a variety of different antiviral mechanisms during their infection of bacterial cells, such as prevention of phage adsorption and DNA entry, cutting of phage nucleic acids, and abortive infection systems [38]. Most reported antiphage systems have been shown to be relevant to the dsDNA phage, but not ssDNA, ssRNA, or dsRNA phages. To further confirm and clarify the first relationship between the TcaR protein and ssDNA phage resistance, the standard plaque assay was performed in E. coli as a model system since little is known about the ssDNA phage infecting Staphylococci. As seen in Figure 5B, induction of the TcaR protein in E. coli conferred increased host resistance to ssDNA phage (M13 and \u03c6X174) infection. However, a TcaR-expressing strain did not demonstrate reduced sensitivity to dsDNA phage Lambda (\u03bb) infection, suggesting that the phage resistance was caused by TcaR-viral ssDNA complex. The observed biological differences point to a remarkable plasticity of TcaR. These findings, thus, may support a hypothesis that TcaR might interfere with viral ssDNA replication and establish a link between TcaR and ssDNA phage resistance.",

Better understanding of these interactions not only will benefit the understanding of many biological mechanisms but also is expected to provide a concept for designing a new therapy for Streptococci. In this work, we present the first attempt to investigate the TcaR-ssDNA interaction. The information of TcaR-ssDNA binding mode and the minimal binding length that we obtained from EMSA analysis and Biacore will be helpful for us to obtain TcaR-ssDNA complexed structure successfully.

Cells were grown in LB media until the optical density (OD600) reached 0.6. TcaR protein was then induced by adding a final concentration of 0.1 mM IPTG and used in plaque assays as previously described [50], [51]. Plaque assays were performed in triplicate. Plates and top-agar contained LB and above mentioned concentrations of inducers. The sensitivity of the host to phage infection was calculated as the efficiency of plaquing, which is the plaque count ratio of a non-IPTG set to the IPTG set [52]. Error-bars were calculated as one standard deviation.",
