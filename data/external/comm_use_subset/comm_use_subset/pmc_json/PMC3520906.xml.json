They mediate sub-threshold, noninactivating voltage-gated potassium currents that have important roles in controlling membrane excitability [1]. Of the five known isoforms, KCNQ1\u20135, KCNQ1 is the only one predominantly expressed in heart. KCNQ1 is the pore forming subunit, tetrameric KCNQ1 complexes give rise to functional channels. In native cells such as cardiomyocytes, KCNQ1 coassembles with a non-conductive accessory KCNE1 subunit, a small single transmembrane protein encoded by KCNE1 gene. The heteromultimeric KCNQ1/KCNE1 was proposed to mediate a slowly activating current that accelerates the repolarization of action potential in cardiac tissues, also known as IKs [2], [3].",

The severity of LQTs varies from syncope to sudden death. LQTs can be either congenital or acquired. More than 50% congenital LQTs cases and 90% LQTs occurring during exercise are linked to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene. Genetic studies of LQT patients have identified at least 113 KCNQ1 mutations, including missense (86/113), nonsense (6/113), deletion (13/113), frame shift (1/113) and splice (7/113) mutations [7]. Potentiation of the KCNQ1 channel by small molecule activators is thought to be a potential and attractive strategy to treat LQTs.",

However, activators for KCNQ1 are still rare and few are effective on the physiologically relevant KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex [13]. Two known examples include R-L3 and zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) [13], [14]. Both potentiate homomeric KCNQ1 channel but lack sensitivity to the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. To date, only three small molecule activators for the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex have been identified. They are mefenamic acid (MFA), DIDS and phenylboronic acid (PBA). Initially, MFA and DIDS were identified as chloride channel blockers [15]. These compounds strongly potentiate the KCNQ1/KCNE1 but exhibit little effect on homomeric KCNQ1. In contrast, PBA, an aromatic derivative of boronic acids, potentiates both the homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex with millimolar effective concentration [16].",

We found that both the homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex were sensitive to HCP at micromolar concentrations and the effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex is much more potent than that on homomeric KCNQ1.

In the presence of 10 \u03bcM HCP, steady-state outward currents at different depolarizing voltages were greatly potentiated. The potentiation on the KCNQ1 channel mediated by previous reported KCNQ1 activators, such as ZnPy and R-L3, involves a hyperpolarizing shift of V\n1/2. To determine the HCP effects on the homomeric KCNQ1, we examined the G-V curves of the KCNQ1 in the absence and presence of 10 \u03bcM HCP. Before application of HCP, the V\n1/2 value was \u221219.43\u00b11.39 mV (Fig. 3E). After application of HCP, the V\n1/2 value was shifted to \u221249.35\u00b11.93 mV with a left-shifting around 30 mV. Inactivation is a distinctive feature for KCNQ1. The inhibition of inactivation by activators, such as ZnPy, is thought to be a contributing factor for an overall increase of current amplitude [13]. We analyzed the inactivation kinetics at different depolarization steps and found no detectable difference before and after application of HCP (Fig. 3B). Hence, HCP increases overall conductance of the KCNQ1 by left-shifting the G-V curve but not affecting inactivation. In addition, HCP also induced delaying of deactivation in hyperpolarizing voltages (Fig. 3C). In the presence of 10 \u03bcM HCP, time constant of deactivation was slowed from 40.05\u00b17.52 ms to 265.51\u00b123.23 ms (n = 3, p<0.01). The reduction of deactivation rate is consistent with the overall increase of current amplitude or G\nmax.",

We tested HCP effects at \u221210 mV, which is the same potential to elicit the KCNQ1 channel.

We found after application of 1 \u03bcM HCP, the IKs was increased 1.34\u00b10.15 fold (n = 4) at +50 mV measured potential. The G-V curve was left shifted \u22127.13\u00b12.44 mV (n = 4) (Fig. 5A, B & C). The effects of HCP on action potential were further examined. The action potential was elicited on isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes by current injection. Upon application of 1 \u03bcM HCP, the action potential duration (APD) was shortened by 10.24\u00b11.71%. Consistently, the APD90 (action potential duration at 90% repolarization) and APD50 (action potential duration at 50% repolarization) were shortened by 10.58\u00b11.88% and 18.82\u00b13.65%, respectively (n = 7) (Fig. 5E & F). The inhibitory effects can not restore in five minutes after removal of the compound but can be reversed by Choromonal 293B, a blocker of IKs. Choromonal 293B at 10 \u03bcM alone prolonged the APD around 30.04\u00b13.15% (n = 4). After co-application of 10 \u03bcM Choromonal 293B, the action potential duration was restored (n = 4) (Fig. 5E). Accordingly, the effects of 1 \u03bcM HCP on APD was reduced to 5.43\u00b11.54% (n = 4). HCP at 3 \u03bcM effects caused further reduction of action potential duration. The change of APD, APD90 and APD50 were 31.71\u00b17.3, 34.11\u00b18.09 and 37.65\u00b17.36, respectively (n = 9). R-L3, a reported IKs activator which shortens APD effectively, was tested as a positive control [14]. In our system, 1 \u03bcM and 3 \u03bcM R-L3 significantly deceased the APD50 about 9.59\u00b11.29% (n = 3) and 25.30\u00b12.29% (n = 3) (Fig. 5D), which were consistent with the previous study. Thus, these data are consistent with the notion that HCP acts on the native KCNQ channels.",

The common phenotype of these mutants is reduction of IKs current, which are commonly thought to be mediated by the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex [2], [3], as a result of decrease in either channel activity or trafficking efficiency. HCP has exhibited potent effects on both the homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex; we thus hypothesize its ability to rescue the function reduction of these mutants. We selected and expressed four mutants, R190Q, T587M, R243C and R539W, which are located in different regions of KCNQ1. Among these mutants, R243C and R539W exhibited low but consistent currents, while the others did not exhibit detectable currents in CHO cells. R243 is located near the C-terminal end of S4 transmembrane domain, while R539W is located at the C-terminal tail [20], [21]. Mutations R243C and R539W were thought to impair activation gating or to reduce PIP2 binding affinity, respectively. In the current study, both homomeric mutant channels were significantly potentiated by 10 \u03bcM HCP. The potentiation on R243C and R539W were comparable with that on KCNQ1 wild type (Fig. 6 and Table 2). We next tested whether HCP was effective on the mutant/KCNE1 and found that both complexes were also sensitive to 10 \u03bcM HCP. The outward currents of R243C/KCNE1 and R539W/KCNE1 were potentiated by 1.44\u00b10.33 (n = 5) and 2.91\u00b10.89 (n = 5) fold, respectively. The effects of HCP on voltage-dependent activation of the mutant channels were also examined and the results are shown in Table 2. Besides R243C/KCNE1, the G-V curves of all tested mutant channels were left-shifted by 10 \u03bcM HCP.",

Interestingly, potentiation effects of R-L3 on the complex seems dependent on the KCNE1 to KCNQ1 ratio. An increased ratio causes noticeable reduction of R-L3 activity [14]. Alanine scanning revealed that R-L3 may interact with specific residues located in the S5 or S6 transmembrane domains of KCNQ1 subunits [25]. Consistently, our previous study showed that residues critical for the potentiation effects by KCNE1 are clustered together in the S6 region in proximity with the critical residues for ZnPy [13]. Different from R-L3 and ZnPy, HCP potentiates both the homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. Mefenamic acid, DIDS and PBA were reported KCNQ1/KCNE1 activators [15], [16]. Although all three compounds exhibit potent effects on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex, similar to HCP, the phenotypes of the three activators easily differentiate HCP from them. Mefenamic acid or DIDS also cause instantaneous opening of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex [26]. However, mefenamic acid and DIDS effects on the homomeric KCNQ1 are much weaker than HCP. They left-shift the G-V curve and slow deactivation but do not increase overall conductance of homomeric KCNQ1 [15], [27]. Differently, HCP significantly increases the overall conductance of the homomeric KCNQ1 (Fig. 2). PBA potentiates both the KNCQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1. Of interest, PBA exhibits inhibitory effect initially and then gradually potentiation effect on both homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. These again argue that PBA and HCP act via different mechanisms [16]. It is of interest that both PBA and HCP have slow off rate; the effects once reaching steady state were difficult to wash off. Taken together, these results suggest that HCP may represent a novel class of KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator.",

            "text": "Current therapy for LQTs is inadequate. Because the critical role of the current mediated by KCNQ1/KCNE1 in repolarization of cardiac action potential, augmenting KCNQ1/KCNE1 by small molecule may represent an attractive strategy to treat LQTs. Our study found that 1 \u03bcM HCP effectively potentiated native IKs and left-shifted the G-V curve. IKs was activated instantaneously in higher concentrations of HCP, including 3 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM. The effects of HCP on shortening the action potential duration in cardiomyocytes further supports its potential use for development therapeutics for LQTs either as a tool compound or as a lead compound. The slight reduction of the action potential amplitude suggests that HCP may affect other channel(s). Most of LQTs-causing mutations were from KCNQ1 among the identified LQT-associated genes including KCNQ1, HERG,SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 [4], [5], [19]. These mutations cause reduction in the potassium current, thereby leading to prolongation of cardiac repolarization [7], [28], [29]. Many mutations of LQTs are trafficked to the plasma membrane, suggesting no major folding defects, but reduction of activity [7], [29]. Among the tested mutants, R190Q is a novel identified mutation located at the linker of S2-S3. It is thought to affect the activation gating of KCNQ1/KCNE1. R587M is a trafficking deficient mutation located at the C-terminal end. Loss of function of R190Q and R587M is consistent to previous reports [30], [31]. R243C is a missense mutation located in S4, a transmembrane segment implicated in activation gating of potassium channels [20]. The suppressed current of R243C/KCNE1 is consistent with the notion that the mutation prevents normal channel gating. The additional mutant R539W was identified in patients with a dominantly inherited classical long QT (Romano\u2013Ward) syndrome. R539 is located at the C-terminal tail and shows a reduced PIP2 binding affinity [21]. It has been demonstrated that PIP2 is necessary for the function of various ion channels including KCNQ channels [32], [33]. A recent study showed that the PIP2 affinity of R539W/KCNE1 is reduced [34]. Potentiation of both R243C and R539W suggests HCP is capable of restoring loss-of-function caused by various mutations, either with impaired gating (R243C) or reduced PIP2 affinity (R539W). However, the effects of HCP on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 mutant channels are weaker than that on wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. For the wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel, 10 \u03bcM HCP dramatically left shifts the G-V curve around \u221266.05\u00b16.15 mV. In contrast, the left shifting for KCNQ1(R539W)/KCNE1 is only \u221229.35\u00b12.74 mV, and furthermore, in the case of KCNQ1(R243C)/KCNE1, the shifting was negligible. Considering physiological efficiency of an activator of KCNQ channel more relies on its effect on the G-V relationship, the weaker or loss of effects of HCP on the G-V curves of these KCNQ1/KCNE1 mutant channels should be considered as major factors in developing therapeutic for LQTs.",
