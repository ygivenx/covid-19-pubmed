            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) based on artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated inhibition of the target gene has evidenced to be an essential tool for antiviral therapy. The amiRNAs are small RNA molecules that are expressed under the backbone of endogenous cellular miRNAs and act as more efficient inhibitors of cellular genes [1]. The amiRNAs express through RNA polymerase II. Like miRNAs, amiRNAs binds to the targeted mRNA in a sequence-specific manner leading to direct mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Ideally, amiRNA-expressing vectors provide unique benefits in designing antiviral therapy as it is less toxic than regular shRNA vector [2\u20134]. Owing to the specificity and efficiency of gene silencing, it was increasingly investigated whether amiRNAs targeted to the viral genome can control viral replication in infected cells. So far, the amiRNA-mediated antiviral approach has found to be useful for many viruses, including adenoviruses, rabies virus, dengue virus, chikungunya, and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus. In all the cases, it has been shown to be an efficient inhibitor of virus replication with minimal or no cytotoxicity [5\u20138].",

It is estimated that 3 billion people living in 24 countries in the WHO Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions are at risk of Japanese encephalitis (JE) [9]. In India, epidemics of JE reported from many parts of the country, and it is considered a major pediatric problem. Notably, in India, vaccination with an attenuated and genetically stable strain SA-14-14-2 started in 2006. However, the efficacy of the vaccine is reported to be less compared to other countries [10]. According to the National Vector-borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP), JE accounted for 13.7% of total 63,854 acute encephalitis syndrome cases reported during 2010\u20132017 and was associated with a case fatality ratio of 17.3% [9]. Therefore, alternative antiviral strategies are required to control JEV.",

The 3\u2032UTR has been shown to be necessary for viral replication and immune modulation. This region consists of elements that are essential for genome cyclization, resulting in the initiation of RNA synthesis [15]. In addition to the critical role 3\u2032UTR plays on RNA synthesis, the stem-loop structure of 3\u2032UTR is also responsible for the generation of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). This sfRNA helps the virus evade host immune response, thereby affecting viral pathogenesis. Therefore, to inhibit the viral replication, we designed amiRNAs against JEV 3\u2032UTR and tested against cell culture-grown JEV strain. Our results suggested that targeting JEV 3\u2032UTR by specific amiRNAs could be useful to reduce viral replication in the neuronal cells.",

To test the binding efficiency of our cloned amiRNAs with the target sequence, we cotransfected amiRNA clone (1,000 ng) and the JEV3\u2032UTR-luciferase vector (100 ng) in HEK293 cells and measured the luciferase assay after 48 h of transfection. Transfection of amiRNA #1 and amiRNA #2 significantly reduced luciferase expressions, where amiRNA #5 did not have any binding effect on its target sequence and observed similar level luciferase activity as seen in control plasmid (Fig. 3A). We confirmed the results by transfecting amiRNA #1, amiRNA #2, and amiRNA #5 at different concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3B, transfection of 50 ng amiRNA clone reduces luciferase level up to 40% and luciferase level decreased in a dose-dependent manner. However, we did not observe any significant changes in the luciferase level with amiRNA #5. One possibility may be amiRNA #5 miRNA may not be able to express in our experimental condition. We checked GFP expression in amiRNA #5-transfected cells and found dose-dependent expression of GFP, suggesting that amiRNA expressed in the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). When we compared 3\u2032UTR sequence of different JEV strain, we found nucleotide difference at 10720 positions (corresponds to the sixth position of the seed sequence of amiRNA #5) between P20778 Vellore strain and other strains (Fig. 3C). Since we are using Vellore strain for this study, the miRNA sequence may not be able to bind correctly to the 3\u2032UTR region.",

In contrast, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR) display exceptional sequence conservation, as these regions play critical roles in translation and RNA replication initiation [21]. Taking advantage of this fact, we designed our amiRNA sequences from the conserved 3\u2032UTR region. The amiRNA #2 seed sequences are highly conserved against all the virulent strains of different genotypes. We checked the RNAi activity of amiRNAs against Vellore strain (P20778). Due to the conservation nature of the seed sequence across the genotypes, we believe that amiRNA #2 will also be able to inhibit other viral strains of different genotypes efficiently. We did not find the significant inhibitory effect of amiRNA #5 even though the sequence cloned correctly and amiRNA #5 expressed in the cells. This may be because there is nucleotide mismatch between Vellore strain and the rest of the viral strain in the seed sequence region (Fig. 3C). This result further emphasizes the importance of complete seed match sequence, while designing the amiRNAs. Also, we concluded that the antiviral activity of amiRNA #2 was sequence specific as it did not induce an additional ISG response compared to control.",
