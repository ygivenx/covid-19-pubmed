Interleukin (IL)-10, one of the most immunosuppressive cytokines, maintains this balance by dampening aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity [1]\u2013[4]. IL-10 blocks the production of proinflammatory cytokines during the resolution period of infection and consequently reducing the immunopathology caused by these cytokines [3], [5]. IL-10 also alters the function of antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages by limiting expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and the production of chemokines, thereby indirectly inhibiting T cell responses and controlling cellular accumulation [1], [4], [6], [7]. In addition to its immunosuppressive effects, IL-10 can stimulate the proliferation of B cells [1], the proliferation and activation of NK cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [1], [8], as well as promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells [4].",

IL-10 is harmful to the host as it promotes immunosuppression and viral persistence [3], [9], [10]. In these instances, the genetic deletion of IL-10 or the blockade of its receptor augments proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses facilitating more efficacious viral clearance and preventing viral persistence [2], [3], [10]\u2013[13]. While enhanced immune responses and viral eradication achieved in the absence of IL-10 may be desirable outcomes, the absence of IL-10 may promote unwanted immune mediated pathology with or without improved viral elimination depending on the site of infection [12]\u2013[16]. Therefore, in these occasions, IL-10 may be necessary to reduce collateral damage due to inflammatory antiviral responses. These varied outcomes not only imply the central role of IL-10 in regulating the magnitude of immune responses, but also underscore the necessity for detailed studies of how IL-10 regulates immunity to infection for the benefit or detriment of the host.",

            "text": "Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is a cytopathic herpesvirus that replicates at high levels in the spleen and liver [17], [18]. Early acute MCMV infection induces a rapid mobilization of NK cells and monocyte/macrophages into infected liver sites [19], [20]. NK cell cytotoxicity and production of antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 limits MCMV infection in the liver [21], [22]. During late acute infection, between 4 and 7 days following MCMV challenge, CD8+ T cells [23] and to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells [24], [25] accumulate and participate in antiviral responses in the liver. CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and the release of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 are associated with viral elimination from this organ [17], [18], [23], [26]. Collectively, these immune responses are protective; however, they contribute to liver pathology and impaired liver function if inadequately regulated [17], [18], [22], [27], [28]. Many studies have characterized the robust proinflammatory immune responses in the liver during acute MCMV infection. By contrast, the negative regulation of these immune responses has not been extensively addressed.",

The suppression of macrophage and dendritic cell costimulatory properties by IL-10 has been shown to limit CD4+ T cell priming during acute MCMV infection [29]. B cell derived IL-10 diminishes CD8+ T cell activation in lymphoid organs, thereby controlling the magnitude of MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses [30]. Additionally, IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells hinders viral elimination in the salivary glands, consequently promoting persistence of MCMV replication within this organ [31]. Further work has described a role for IL-10 in reducing systemic IFN-\u03b3 production, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses and viral elimination in the spleen during MCMV infection [28]. NK cells have been implicated as sources of IL-10 in MCMV-infected perforin-deficient mice and have been suggested to restrain exaggerated CD8+ T cell responses in this model [32]. Finally, a recent study has demonstrated the impact of IL-10 in the regulation of cytokine responses and inflammation in the liver during MCMV infection, through IL-10 repletion experiments in MCMV-infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice [33]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what endogenous cellular sources of IL-10 modulate inflammatory processes in the liver in normal, wild type mice and what cellular effectors are affected by IL-10 functions in the liver during acute MCMV infection.",

To identify the cells expressing IL-10 on day 4 after MCMV infection, liver leukocytes were prepared from IL-10-(IRES)-GFP-enhanced reporter (tiger) mice infected for 4 days. Furthermore, liver leukocytes from uninfected or day 4 MCMV-infected non-reporter C57BL/6J (WT) mice were included in the analysis to indicate background fluorescence. Analyses show that liver leukocytes from uninfected tiger mice marginally expressed IL-10/GFP, whereas after infection, 10%\u00b11% of the gated leukocytes were IL-10/GFP+ (Fig. 2A). IL-10/GFP+ liver leukocytes were then characterized by their expression of NK1.1 and TCR\u03b2 and delineated as NK cells (NK1.1+ TCR\u03b2\u2212), T cells (NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2+), NK1.1+ T cells (NK1.1+ TCR\u03b2+) and non-NK1.1+ non-TCR\u03b2+ cells (NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2\u2212) (Fig. 2B). On day 4 after infection, we found that higher frequencies of IL-10/GFP+ cells were NK1.1+ TCR\u03b2\u2212 (NK cells), as compared to NK1.1+ TCR\u03b2+, NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2\u2212, and NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2+ cells (NK cells 56%\u00b13% compared to NK1.1+ T cells: 5%\u00b11%, and non-NK non T cells: 12%\u00b11%, and T cells: 27%\u00b12%) (Fig. 2C). These trends were also reflected in the absolute numbers of IL-10/GFP+ cells, with NK cells being the most numerous of the IL-10/GFP+ cells within the day 4 infected liver leukocyte population relative to other examined cell types (Fig. 2D). Further characterization of IL-10/GFP+ NK cells by flow cytometry revealed that IL-10/GFP+ NK cells (defined as NKp46+ CD3\u03b5\u2212) expressed known markers of maturation, DX5/CD49b, CD122, CD11b, KLRG1, and CD43 (Table S1). More than 50% of these cells were Ly49H+, CD69+, and skewed to a CD27+ CD11b+ NK cell phenotype (Table S1). Additionally, characterization of IL-10/GFP+ TCR\u03b2+ cells demonstrated that these T cells were comprised of both CD8+ and CD4+ cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that during acute MCMV infection, several cell types contribute IL-10 in the liver, most of which are mature and activated NK cells.",

Sera were collected and protein levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and CXCL9 were measured using ELISA (Fig. 3, A, C and E). Serum levels of all three cytokines peaked at day 4.

The production of IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9 by WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 liver leukocytes was increased as infection progressed. The levels of IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher on days 4 and 7 post infection in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 liver leukocytes compared to WT (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, while the kinetics of CXCL9 production were similar between WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice on days 4 and 5 post infection, CXCL9 levels produced by IL-10\u2212/\u2212 leukocytes were greater 7 days post infection as compared to levels measured in WT leukocyte conditioned media (Fig. 3F). In contrast, TNF-\u03b1 levels in infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 liver leukocytes were elevated above WT over the course of infection, though these differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these observations indicate that IL-10 clearly suppresses the production of systemic inflammatory cytokines during MCMV infection, while the effects of IL-10 in the liver appear limited to suppression of IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that this cytokine response could be attributed to an augmented presence of inflammatory effector leukocytes in infected IL-10 deficient livers. To assess whether IL-10 deficiency alters the infiltration of these critical immune effectors, total liver leukocyte numbers from uninfected and infected WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice were compared.

The numbers of NKp46+ TCR\u03b2\u2212 NK cells in WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers at 4 days post infection were nearly comparable (Fig. 4B). However, NK cell numbers were higher in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers than in WT livers at 5 and 7 days post infection. Despite differences in the numbers of infiltrating NK cells, NK cells from IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited similar kinetics in accumulation and contraction as those in WT mice. Like NK cells, the numbers of F4/80+ CD11b+ monocyte/macrophages were also increased on day 7 following infection (Fig. 4C) in the absence of IL-10. Furthermore, total numbers of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4D) and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4E, Day 5 only) were elevated in infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers as compared to their WT counterparts 5 and 7 days post MCMV infection. These findings prompted further analysis of the persistence of these cells beyond day 7. By day 9 post infection the numbers of CD8+ T cells found in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers were comparable to WT (Fig. 5D), whereas the numbers of macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells in these same IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers were still higher as compared to day 9 WT livers (Fig. 5, A\u2013C). These observations suggest that IL-10 regulates the persistence of effector cells in the liver following MCMV infection.",

Given the augmented accumulation of CD8+ T cells in infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers noted above, we evaluated whether IL-10 deficiency affected the infiltration of cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells activated by an immunodominant epitope of MCMV, an H-2Db viral peptide derived from the MCMV M45 protein [41]\u2013[43]. The frequencies and total numbers of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 producing CD8+ T cells were determined by intracellular staining for these cytokines after restimulation with this viral peptide. The results shows that the frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ (Fig. 6A) and TNF-\u03b1+ (Fig. 6C) CD8+ T cells on day 5 post infection were comparable between WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited decreased frequencies of both IFN-\u03b3+ (Fig. 6A) and TNF-\u03b1+ (Fig. 6C) CD8+ T cells on day 7 post infection.

Despite these differences on day 5, the numbers of both IFN-\u03b3+ and TNF-\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers from mice infected for 7 days were comparable to those numbers in WT (Fig. 6, B and D).

The formation of inflammatory clusters in the liver after MCMV infection has been correlated with the onset of damage as well as the establishment of antiviral responses at this site [20], [27], [44]. To dissect the consequences of IL-10 deficiency on liver inflammation after infection, we first quantitated the number of inflammatory foci in livers using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained liver sections taken from uninfected and MCMV-infected WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice. We noted no differences in the numbers of inflammatory clusters counted in WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers infected for 4 days (Table 1). However, by days 5 and 7 post infection, there were increased numbers of inflammatory foci observed in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers as compared to WT. By day 9 post infection, the number of foci in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers was nearly comparable to WT. Furthermore, the number of nucleated cells within each focus was greater in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers than in WT livers infected for 5 and 7 days (Table 1), thus, corroborating our previous observations of increased leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 4A).",

Using this approach, we revealed no distinct differences in PAS staining between the livers of uninfected WT (Fig. 7, A and B) and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 (Fig. 7, E and F) mice.

WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited elevated serum ALT on day 4 and 5 after infection, with serum values in the IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice higher than WT on day 5 post infection, though these differences did not attain statistical significance (Table 2). On day 7 after infection, serum ALT levels had declined in both WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice, although the levels in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice remained elevated compared to WT levels (Table 2). Finally, viral titers of infected WT and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers were examined to determine whether the inflated immune responses and resultant immunopathology in infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers coincided with improved viral clearance. Despite the increased immune responses and pathology during infection in the absence of IL-10, viral titers in the IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers remained comparable to those in WT livers at all time points analyzed (Table 3). Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 minimizes immunopathology during acute MCMV infection without affecting viral clearance in the liver.",

Furthermore, they highlight NK cells as major sources of IL-10, though other cells, such as T cells and mononuclear cells also contribute IL-10. The absence of IL-10 during acute infection results in inflated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and accumulation of inflammatory cells in infected livers.

Macrophages and dendritic cells [29], B cells [30] and CD4+ T cells [31], [47] have been shown to produce IL-10 during this infection, though their contributions to IL-10 production in acutely infected livers remain to be examined. Virus-specific CD8+ T cells have been identified as important IL-10 producers during infections of influenza A [48], respiratory syncytial virus [15] and coronavirus [49]. It is possible that MCMV-specific, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells contribute IL-10 in the liver during this infection, although further characterization of IL-10+ T cells at this site is necessary as regulatory subsets of CD4+ T cells [50] and CD8+ T cells [51], [52] have been shown to also generate IL-10 in various contexts. Finally, our study cannot rule out the contributions of specific NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2\u2212 cells, which may include macrophages and dendritic cells, to IL-10 mediated regulation in the liver. Peritoneal and splenic macrophages and dendritic cells produce IL-10 after MCMV infection [29] and it is known that monocyte/macrophages accumulate in the liver during infection [18], [38], [39]. Therefore, further studies are necessary to delineate IL-10+ cells within the NK1.1\u2212 TCR\u03b2\u2212 population and the TCR\u03b2+ population, as these may also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in the liver during infection.",

Consistent with previous observations [28], [33], we found that in the absence of IL-10 there is augmented cellular infiltration of livers and increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9. Though TNF-\u03b1 production is involved in the cytokine response during MCMV infection, we note that TNF-\u03b1 protein levels, though increased systemically in the absence of IL-10, remained unchanged in the liver during acute MCMV infection, corroborating with reported transcript data [33]. Elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9 may partly account for the increased CD8+ T cell accumulation in MCMV-infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers as studies have associated liver production of IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL9 with recruitment of MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells to the liver during MCMV infection [23], [38]. Additionally, the increased cellular accumulation in MCMV-infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 livers may also reflect the broad immunosuppressive impact of IL-10 on cellular activation and proliferation [1]\u2013[5]. IL-10 dampens macrophage proliferation and T cell priming [1], [4], [6], [7], and during acute MCMV infection, IL-10 limits CD8+ T cell numbers in lymphoid organs [28], [30], [32], thereby, perhaps restricting the numbers of cells recruited to the liver.",

Although the cells and cytokines that mediate liver damage in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice have yet to be clearly identified, it has been established that overproduction of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 can promote the development of severe hepatitis during acute MCMV infection [18], [22], [27]. Moreover, excess production of these cytokines by activated monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been associated with MCMV-induced liver disease in immunodeficient mice [22]. It is probable that increased cellular accumulation and the elevated production of inflammatory mediators such as IFN\u03b3 and CXCL9 as well as others not evaluated by this study accounts for the extent of liver disease in observed IL-10 deficient livers. Our findings support the conclusions of recent studies in MCMV infection [33] and other viral infections [16], [48] that demonstrate IL-10 as a key cytokine in limiting immune mediated pathology during viral infection.",

These findings contrasted other studies, which demonstrated IL-10 suppresses MCMV elimination in the spleen [28] and salivary glands [31]. These differences may reflect compartmental differences in viral elimination and in regulation of antiviral immune responses. Lack of improved clearance in IL-10 deficient livers could be attributed to the activity of other immunoregulatory mechanisms such as programmed death-1(PD-1)-PD-L1 (PD ligand-1) or Tim-3-galectin-9, which are known to negatively regulate T cell responses. Interestingly, multiple cell types in the liver express the ligands to these molecules [54]\u2013[57], and PD-1 and Tim-3 have been shown to be upregulated on CD8+ T cells during both acute [58]\u2013[61] and chronic persistent viral infections [10], [61]\u2013[64]. Further work exploring the roles of inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions during acute MCMV infection in the liver in the absence of IL-10 may elucidate mechanisms underlying compartmental differences in viral elimination.",

NK cells are identified as prominent expressers of IL-10, although other cell populations also contribute to IL-10 in the liver during this infection. The absence of IL-10 mediated suppression during MCMV infection results in amplified cellular and cytokine responses that ultimately result in liver injury. In spite of a robust immune response in infected IL-10-deficient livers, viral clearance is not improved. Therefore, our results highlight the role for IL-10 and cellular sources of IL-10 in the protection of the liver from damage due to infection induced inflammatory responses.",
