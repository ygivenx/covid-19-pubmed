            "text": "Aerosols consist of particles in a range of sizes. Traditionally droplets of >5 \u03bcm diameter have been implicated in short range (<1 m) spread, and droplet nuclei of <5 \u03bcm are believed to be responsible for longer range or airborne transmission (>1 m)\n[5]. However, larger-sized particles may be responsible for wider pathogen spread depending on other factors. For example, particles of the same size may travel different distances, depending on the velocity of the jet propelling them\n[6]. These particle dynamics remain undefined in the clinical setting, and the implications are significant from an infection prevention and control perspective. In addition to its effect on dispersion, particle size has implications for the inhaling host. Larger particles (>10 \u03bcm) will be deposited by impaction in the upper respiratory tract and smaller particles (0.003-5 \u03bcm) may penetrate the tracheobronchial and alveolar regions, principally through sedimentation and diffusion\n[7]. By studying the aerosols produced by infected individuals, we hope to precisely characterize how long virus infectivity persists in suspended aerosol droplets of various sizes. Recent work has begun to address this question for bacterial transmission by patients with cystic fibrosis\n[8, 9]. The question of droplet survival duration pertains to droplet size distribution and, on this front, there are discrepancies across the literature which are likely due to the varying measurement methodologies and techniques. Solid impaction with micrometry, a method that is insensitive to smaller droplets, revealed particle sizes from 1 to 2,000 \u03bcm\n[10]. Size distribution analysis using an optical droplet counter\n[11\u201313] is reportedly less accurate for particles >2 \u03bcm\n[14] but is useful in the submicron size range. Other previous techniques to measure size distribution include aerodynamic droplet sizer\n[15, 16], scanning mobility particle spectrometer\n[15], Andersen six-stage cascade impactor\n[17], electrical low pressure impactor\n[18], interferometric Mie imaging\n[19] and laser diffraction\n[13, 20]. Aside from the dependency on initial size, the change in droplet size due to evaporation and condensation is also directly related to their chemical composition\n[21]. Recent findings suggest a tri-modal size distribution during speech or voluntary coughing, with bronchiolar fluid film burst and laryngeal modes both contributing to a distribution peak centred near 1 \u03bcm size and with an oral mode yielding a distribution peak centred near 100 \u03bcm size due to droplets produced between the epiglottis and the lips\n[22].",

            "text": "The viability of airborne pathogens also depends on other factors, including environmental humidity, temperature and the presence of ultraviolet light. The relationship between these factors and infectivity is poorly understood. A recent study using a breathing mannequin and bioaerosol samplers indicated that high relative humidity (RH) was associated with reduced infectivity of influenza virus\n[24]. Earlier studies using small settling chambers, influenza bioaerosols and guinea pigs found inactivation at high RH\n[25\u201328]. Evaporation and particle shrinkage are expected since particles typically enter an environment at lower RH than the respiratory tract\n[14]. The evaporation process is fast; particles of 10 mm diameter or less typically evaporate in less than 0.5 seconds\n[21]. At low RH, droplets evaporate more quickly and remain suspended longer compared to droplets generated under conditions of higher RH, thereby increasing the probability of ensuing inhalation\n[6, 21, 29]. Temperature has also been shown to enhance or interrupt transmission at low (5\u00b0C) or high (30\u00b0C) temperature, respectively, for all values of RH\n[28]. Assessment of data in the literature suggested a relationship between absolute humidity (AH) and influenza survival. When extended to a human population level study, negative local daily deviation of AH from its 31 year mean was found to be associated with the start of influenza outbreaks during the winter\n[30, 31]. Studies on the effect of ultraviolet light irradiation showed avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was inactivated after at least thirty minutes of exposure\n[32], while adenoviruses appeared to be UV-resistant\n[33, 34]. The vaccinia virus was found to be less susceptible to ultraviolet radiation at high RH than at low RH\n[35]. The precise mechanisms through which RH, AH, temperature and UV light exposure affect virus transmission and survival require clarification.",

Although cough droplet sizes have been characterized, more research is needed to examine cough flows from infected individuals. Much is known about airflow rates during coughing\n[37\u201339], including parameters such as Cough Peak Flow Rate (CPFR), Peak Velocity Time (PVT) and Cough Expired Volume (CEV), that is the area under the flow rate versus time curve. A study of 12 female and 13 male subjects showed that the non-dimensional airflow rate (Flow rate/CPFR) versus non-dimensional time (Time/PVT) curve could be defined by two gamma-probability functions based on the medical parameters of CPFR, PVT and CEV that were themselves related to height, weight and gender\n[40]. Also, a sequential cough was found to be a combination of two single coughs, with the first being approximately the same as a single cough, whilst the second was a scaled down version of the first. Visualizations\n[40] showed that the airflow direction did not vary greatly amongst the subjects and, although mouth opening remained constant during a cough, there was a considerable variation of area across the subjects with no correlation to other parameters such as height. Their research examined the bulk parameter of flow rate, whilst earlier studies examined the flow field qualitatively using strobe photography\n[41] or thermal plume imaging by Schlieren\n[42]. More recently, quantitative analysis of shadowgraph images indicated that this technique requires a significant temperature difference (10\u00b0C) between exhaled air and room temperature and that coughs were detectable out to a maximum distance of 0.6 m from the source\n[43]. Quantitative analysis of high-speed video images of a cough were limited to a similar range whilst also requiring the cougher to expel cigarette smoke as a tracer substance\n[44], which is problematic to apply in the study of humans with respiratory illness due to the unacceptable possibility of causing harm to participants. Accurate velocity measurements at greater distances in the far-field of a cough require a different measurement technique and approach.",

Such measurements have revealed a peak cough velocity of 6 to 22 m/s, with an average of 11.2 m/s\n[51], but usually mouth area is merely assumed and not measured\n[50\u201352]. Kwon et al.\n[53] reported average initial cough velocities of 15.2 m/s (males) and 10.6 m/s (females), with the angle of exhaled air being 38\u00b0 (males) and 32\u00b0 (females), although it is doubtful whether this difference in angle is statistically significant. Singh et al.\n[39] found the peak flow rate produced by women to be 60% that of men and Chao et al.\n[19] reported the maximum cough velocity of women to be approximately 77% that of men. On the other hand, VanSciver et al.\n[49] found no significant difference in maximum cough velocity related to sex and weight of the cougher. Furthermore, they noted that, from the fluid dynamic point of view, a cough may be considered as a short-duration transient jet, being notably unlike a very-short-duration jet in which much of the cough would be entrained in a single vortex ring. Their PIV data showed a wide range of maximum cough velocities (1.5 to 28.8 m/s) and that the self-similarity of flow profiles associated with a transient jet was not applicable to coughs, such that it is necessary to develop an envelope of cough profiles rather than attempting to define a \u201ctypical\u201d cough. The measurements by Zhu et al.\n[51] showed that some saliva droplets produced during a cough can travel further than 2 m and (using the Lagrangian equation) that the transport characteristics of expelled saliva droplets change with size. Furthermore, a recent study of patients with cystic fibrosis emitting cough aerosols, which were collected with an Anderson Impactor in a wind tunnel of modest cross-sectional area, reported that viable bacteria can travel 4 m from the patient or remain aloft for up to 45 minutes\n[9]. These findings call into question the \u201c3 feet/1 metre rule\u201d or \u201c6 feet/2 metre rule\u201d, which have been considered to be safe separation distances for preventing droplet transmission\n[54], and motivate further study of virus-laden bioaerosols and the velocity field at extended distances from the source. Indeed, all previous PIV flow measurements have been taken near the mouth, where velocities are highest, rather than far downstream near the limits of possible person-to-person transmission.",

The measured data will also be of use to other researchers who are attempting to develop realistic theoretical\n[55] or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\n[50, 56] models for cough jets/plumes and virus transmission. Such models require reliable modeling of the transport of aerosol droplets and virus particles. In addition, data from human subjects may be used to test simpler models that use the spatial distribution of expiratory aerosols and the viability functions of airborne viruses to estimate exposures to airborne viruses in the indoor environment, where previously such models were based on artificial puff sources, e.g.\n[57]. This introductory review has covered issues such as cough droplet sizes and the influence of environmental parameters, notably temperature and relative humidity, which will be studied as part of the WeCoF project.

Figure \n1 shows a diagrammatic layout of the facility for PIV measurements, with the subject seated outside the chamber. Since the entrainment of ambient air into the cough jet is important to the development of that jet, a solid barrier with only a small opening for the mouth (such as the 5 \u00d7 3 cm hole used by\n[51]) is inappropriate. In the FLUGIE, the opening is pear-shaped such that the participant\u2019s nose and mouth area are unobstructed whilst a cough is directed into the enclosed test chamber. The major vertical axis of the pear-shaped opening is 15 cm high and the base of the opening, where the participant\u2019s chin rests, is 67 cm above the chamber floor. The minor horizontal axis of the pear-shaped opening is 10.5 cm wide. This chamber inlet has a cover, which is only opened when a cough is introduced into the chamber.",

The salient point is to allow sufficient separation between the cough and all solid boundaries, such that the flow does not exhibit any significant deviation from a cough in fully open surroundings. Even though a participant may be coughing at an open bench towards an open fume hood, the distance from the mouth to the fume hood is of interest, as well as whether the fume hood fan is operating and possibly affecting the cough flow. Hence, a chamber of ample size is preferable as a quiescent environment in which a cough flow may be studied without flow disturbances from uncontrolled surroundings. The internal dimensions (1.81 m length, 1.78 m width and 1.81 m height) for FLUGIE were sized for separation distances to be greater than participant mouth diameter by more than an order of magnitude. At the measurement window, the separations decrease to less than an order of magnitude due to the lateral spreading of the cough flow with distance from the mouth, yet remain several times the lateral extent of the cough. The test chamber is raised by 0.25 m above the laboratory floor and mounted upon casters to allow measurement at various streamwise positions.",

The distribution of values of the spatially-averaged maximum velocity magnitude is illustrated in Figure \n5. The average value across all 36 coughs is 0.52 m/s, but with the data from the three poor quality experiments removed, the average across the remaining 27 tests is 0.41 m/s. These values indicate that there is significant air motion during a cough, of the order of 0.5 m/s, at a location as far away as 1 m from the person who is coughing. During the set-up phase for this preliminary study, a single volunteer produced 5 coughs, with a 180-mm-wide PIV field being located at different distances from the mouth for each cough. The participant attempted to produce a series of coughs each of the same strength. Although the quality of the resulting vector field was not sufficient to provide quantitative data, it was possible to identify the arrival of the cough front at each location and, thereby, estimate the velocity of the cough front at the centre of each field of view. The results are shown in Figure \n6, illustrating the rapid decrease in velocity in the near-field of the mouth, as would be expected. At 1 m from the mouth the cough front velocity has a magnitude in agreement with the average of the spatially-averaged maximum velocity magnitude from our preliminary study with 12 healthy participants. Note that the fitted curve is based on an approximation of a linear growth of the cough jet diameter with distance from the mouth.",
