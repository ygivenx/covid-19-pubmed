Primary PTEC and PBEC were isolated from the tracheae and bronchi, respectively, of swine that were shown by multiplex PCR to be negative for porcine respiratory tract pathogens. PTEC and PBEC were cultured under ALI conditions for four weeks. Histological staining of semi-thin sections indicated that both cultures showed the characteristic appearance of a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (Fig. 1A), similar to that obtained by H&E staining of tissue derived from the primary bronchus and trachea of swine (Fig. 1B). Examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the majority of cells contained cilia (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, PTEC and PBEC were shown by fluorescent staining to contain ciliated, mucus-producing cells and basal cells (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that the airway epithelial cells were well-differentiated. There were no major differences in the results obtained with PTEC and PBEC. Therefore, in the following part only results obtained with PBEC are shown.",

Both \u03b12,3-linked (red) and \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids (green) were expressed on the apical surface of PBEC cultures but the \u03b12,6-linkage type was predominant (Fig. 2B). Co-localization of Maackia amurensis agglutinin II (MAA II) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) signals (Fig. 2B, arrows) indicates that some cells expressed sialic acids in both linkage types. When lectins were applied from the basal side, wdPBEC were primarily stained by MAA II and hardly by SNA (Fig. 2C). Strong MAA II staining is found in the same area that is stained by the basal cell marker (compare 2A and 2C) indicating that basal cells mainly contain \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids. The distribution of sialic acids in wdPBEC was analyzed also by co-staining of sialic acids and cilia or mucus markers. Both \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids (green) were detected on ciliated cells (red), while non-ciliated cells predominantly contained \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid (Fig. 2D). Mucin/mucus-producing cells (red) were found to have \u03b12,6-linked but not \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 2D).",

R1 is derived from the pandemic strain A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) and has a binding preference to \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids. R2 differs from R1 by two mutations in the haemagglutinin and prefers binding to \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid12. WdPBEC cultures on filter supports were inoculated by R1 or R2 from the apical surface at an MOI of 0.25. At all time points analysed, the titre of R1 virus released from the apical side of wdPBEC was somewhat higher than that of R2 (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with the abundant presence of the \u03b12,6- linkage type on the apical surface, but it also shows that R2 is able to replicate to substantial titres despite the low amount of \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid detected by MAA staining (Fig. 2B). When IAV was applied from the basal side of wdPBEC, there was no significant difference in the replication kinetics irrespective of the binding preference for \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids (Fig. 3A).",

This defence mechanism is based on the mucins produced by mucus-producing cells and the ciliary activity of specialized epithelial cells that transport the mucus out of the respiratory tract45. To understand the infection of airway epithelial cells, it is necessary to use culture systems that comprise mucus-producing cells and ciliated cells. To this end, we and others studied IAV infection in differentiated ALI cultures of human airway epithelial cells which contain all major cell types present in human airway epithelium in vivo, namely, ciliated cells, secretory cells and basal cells12131415. Here we developed and employed swine ALI (swALI) cultures that can be used to analyze the infection by both human and swine IAV1617. Compared to the human counterpart, swALI cells have the advantage that the source of cells is well-defined and reproducible as far as the age and genetic background of the animals. The growth conditions of swALI cultures were different from those described for human ALI cultures. The difficulty in establishing this system may explain why so far only few reports about differentiated respiratory epithelial cells of swine are available161718. The novel feature in our study is that we analysed events occurring late after infection not addressed in previous analyses with swine or human ALI cultures.",

As influenza virions are released from the apical side of the polarized epithelial cells, spread of infection is expected not to be as efficient as in the case of immortalized cells which are covered by medium.

Another effect of the infection was a significant reduction in the amount of cilia detected on infected airway epithelial cells. The reduction was more pronounced in swIAV-infected cultures compared to cells infected by either of the two human IAV. The difference is consistent with a more efficient infection by swIAV as indicated by the 10-fold increased amount of virus released into the supernatant. The reduced staining of \u03b2-tubulin can be explained by the loss of ciliated cells, probably due to the apoptotic effect of the infection mentioned above. This conclusion is based on the reduced thickness of the epithelial cell layer at late times of infection that was observed in parallel to the loss of cilia staining. The loss of cilia and the reduction in epithelial thickness were also observed in swIAV-infected porcine trachea tissue explants23. The loss of ciliated cells was clearly detected with cultures infected by swIAV. In the case of human IAV, where the foci of infected cells were not as large as those of swIAV-infected ALI cultures, the thickness of the epithelial layer was not significantly reduced. Our results are consistent with data from IAV infections in swine. Airways infected by swIAV have been reported to be lined by flattened epithelial layers24.",

A recent study reported IAV infection interrupts the tight junction formation in an in vitro alveolar culture model comprising immortalized epithelial cells25. In our study, however, the well differentiated tracheal and bronchial epithelia retain their barrier function. The finding of epithelial cells with tight junctions indicates that the lost ciliated cells were replaced by polarized cells that were able to maintain the barrier function of the epithelium. It appears that basal cells had started to differentiate into specialized cells. This process had not yet proceeded to the appearance of ciliated cells and mucus-producing cells, or other non-ciliated cells, but the differentiation had resulted in polarized epithelial cells that were sufficient to maintain the barrier function as indicated by the TEER. The reorganization of the epithelial cells has also been observed in a report, where mice were infected by IAV in vivo26. The intermediate position of the polarized cells is shown by our lectin staining data, which may indicate that the cells are in a differentiation process. Undifferentiated human airway epithelial cells have been shown to contain \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids and the expression of \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids is increasing over time during the differentiation phase27. Whereas \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids are abundantly present on well-differentiated cells, basal cells mainly contained \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids. Both linkage types of sialic acids were detected in polarized cells at late times of infection indicating an increased amount of \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid on the apical surface of the epithelium compared to the uninfected state.",

In this context it is interesting to note that the above mentioned increase of the \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids on the apical surface indicates an increased abundance of receptors for avian influenza viruses.
