The campus area is primarily residential and commercial, without heavy traffic or industrial sources. The inlet of the sampling system was placed 20 m above ground on top of a six-floor building located > 500 m away from major roads. Local emission sources within a 1-km radius include vehicular traffic and fuel combustion for domestic cooking, heating, and construction. A study of the spatial variability of PM2.5 mass and chemical composition in 1999\u20132002 showed only minor differences between a PKU campus site and an urban measurement site located approximately 10 km southeast from the PKU measurement site. The setup of the measurement station is described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Wehner et al. 2004, 2008).",

Sampling was done using a Twin Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (TDMPS; Birmili et al. 1999), consisting of two Hauke-type differential mobility analyzers and two condensation particle counters (models 3010 and 3025; TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) which covered the size range from 3 nm to 800 nm (mobility diameter) and an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS; model 3321; TSI Inc.) which measured particles between 800 nm and 1 \u03bcm (aerodynamic diameter). To combine both measurements, APS data were transformed from aerodynamic diameter to Stokes diameter assuming an effective particle density of 1.7 g/cm3 for the particles > 800 nm, because these particles are dominated by sulfate and crustal material in Beijing (Yao et al. 2003). A low-flow PM10 inlet was used to minimize contamination by large dust particles. The ambient aerosol was dried in a diffusion drier before entering the air-conditioned laboratory to avoid condensation of water in the inlet systems during warm and humid days in summertime. The data were corrected for losses due to diffusion and sedimentation within the inlet line. Size-dependent losses for the TDMPS inlet line were estimated using empirical particle loss corrections (diffusion and gravitation) from Willeke and Baron (1993). Losses of 4-nm and 10-nm particles were estimated to be 35% and approximately 10%, respectively.",

The data acquisition system of the hospital recorded only patients who did not stay longer than 1 day. A standardized form was completed by medically trained study personnel at PKU, School of Public Health, by abstracting the data from the medical records. A database was built on the basis of these files, and respiratory clinical end points were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [World Health Organization (WHO) 1993] for respiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes J00\u2013J99). Total respiratory ERV comprise acute upper respiratory infections (J00\u2013J06), pneumonia (J18), acute bronchitis (J20), other diseases of the upper respiratory tract (J30\u2013J39), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40\u2013J47). In addition, location of permanent residence was recorded for each case; based on this information, only patients from Haidian district were considered for further analysis. Because of an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003, all patients with body temperature > 38\u00b0C were separately treated in the hospital, and these cases were excluded. Assignment of the diagnoses to ICD-10 disease categories were quality-assured by a nosological expert from the Third Hospital, resulting in a good agreement, as the percentage of misclassification was about 4%.",

As further potential confounders, we considered the meteorologic parameters air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. We accounted for time-delayed effects of these variables using arithmetic means for days up to 7 days before the visit. Additional influences of the year, season (December\u2013February, March\u2013May, June\u2013August, September\u2013November), month, day of the month and holiday, represented by categorical variables were investigated as well. The base model was selected according to Akaike\u2019s information criterion (Akaike 1974) and statistical significance of the covariates (p < 0.05). Nonlinear effects were modeled by regression splines with an automatic smoothness selection (Wood 2006). The smoothness of the trend function was manually adjusted based on the absolute value of the sum of the partial autocorrelation function (Touloumi et al. 2006).",

We constrained the lag coefficients in PDL models to follow a third-degree polynomial of the lag number.

NO2 itself has adverse health effects at high concentrations (> 200 \u03bcg/m3) (WHO 2005), but such levels are rare in Beijing. NO2 originates mainly from combustion processes and traffic, which are major sources of air pollution in Beijing (Sun et al. 2004), and NO2 is often correlated with other pollutants. Traffic-related air pollution has been associated with respiratory diseases in several studies (Brunekreef et al. 2009). In our two-pollutant models, associations with NO2 were most consistent. When controlling for NO2, associations with 100\u2013300 nm stayed moderately significant (p < 0.09). A pollutant that exhibits a relatively strong association in a multipollutant model may be acting as a surrogate for an unmeasured or poorly measured pollutant (Peel et al. 2005). In addition, associations with pollutants based on single-pollutant models may be attributable to an association with another pollutant that is correlated with the measured pollutant. Typically, epidemiologic studies (including ours) cannot verify to what extent associations with NO2 are attributable to NO2 itself or to other pollutants correlated with NO2. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that observed associations for NO2 were due to NO2-correlated air pollution.",

Measurements from only one station were used for the particle size distribution data, and we were not able to assess spatial variation in particle number concentrations. Our measurement site may be considered as an urban background station because of its location (20 m height and > 500 m from a major road). Average particle number size distributions at a PKU measurement site and another regional measurement site, located approximately 50 km south of the PKU, were similar (Yue et al. 2009), confirming that our measurement site may be considered as an urban background station. In Beijing, concentrations of fine PM (PM2.5 and PM10) are evenly distributed over the urban area, including the Haidian district (Cheng et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009). In urban areas, differences of absolute particle number concentrations between different measurement sites can be great (Krudysz et al. 2009), with the largest variations in ultrafine (< 100 nm) and coarse (2,500\u201310,000 nm) particles and more homogenous spatial distributions of accumulation mode particles (100\u20132,000 nm) (Monn 2001). The low correlation between NO2\u2014as an urban average, representing traffic exhaust levels and the main source of UFP\u2014and UFP might suggest low correlation between UFP at the measurement site and UFP levels elsewhere in the city. On the other hand, moderate correlations between UFP and NO2 were observed for subgroups, for example, seasons or particle subfractions of UFP. Personal levels of UFP can differ substantially, such as in proximity to traffic (Kaminsky et al. 2009). However, Buzorius et al. (1999), Cyrys et al. (2008), and Puustinen et al. (2007) showed that daily temporal correlations of particle number concentration time series between different monitoring sites are high. The authors concluded that using one carefully chosen monitoring site is a reasonable approach to characterize exposure of particle number concentrations in epidemiologic time-series studies. When associations are estimated by Poisson regression model in time-series studies, Lipfert and Wyzga (1995) argued that exposure misclassification will reduce the precision of effect estimates, resulting in wider CIs, but will not bias estimates. On the other hand, bias away from the null can occur in time-series studies of multiple pollutants, such as this one, when measurement errors of different pollutants are correlated (Zeger et al. 2000).",
