This is a novel virus belonging to genus Beta coronavirus and was first reported in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in September 2012 (1). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) summary and literature update-as of 9 May 2014 in KSA suggested that more than 60% patients including health care workers have acquired infection in hospital setting. Besides, 15% of health care workers tested positive with MERS-CoV severe infection were either admitted to intensive care unit or died. Last update (7 March 2015) by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on MERS reported a total of 938 cases and 402 deaths in KSA, suggesting epicenter of outbreak, with health care workers at highest risk of acquiring infection. Mode of transmission was mainly by close contacts with infected person such as those caring for or living with them. However, virus transmission through a hospital cluster suggested that the mode of spread is through contact and in the form of droplets (2).",

Additionally occurrence of asymptomatic and subclinical MERS-CoV cases in population could pose a huge threat to dental practice by transmitting infections between dentist and patients and the dental team. To ensure safe working environment and to prevent transmission of infection in dental practice CDC developed guidelines, which mainly included standard precaution and transmission based isolation precautions (airborne, droplet and contact precautions). Strict adherences of these guidelines are needed to prevent the potential spread of infection in dental practice.",

List of private hospitals and polyclinics providing dental care in Riyadh city was obtained by using health insurance provider network, and the list of universities providing dental care was obtained by visiting ministry of higher education website of Saudi Arabia. Similarly, list of government armed forces dental care facilities in Riyadh city was also prepared. From among the above mentioned dental care facilities few dental centers were selected randomly by applying lottery method. DHPs including clinical level dental students, interns, dental practitioners and dental auxiliaries working in these facilities were invited to participate in the study. A convenience sampling methodology was utilized to recruit DHPs based on ease of availability during survey period. Trained dental interns approached DHPs in their work place and distributed the questionnaires along with required instructions. Confidentiality of the data was assured to DHPs. All the participants were informed about the purpose and scope of the study and those who agreed to sign the consent form were considered in this study.",

Secondly, pretesting of the questionnaire was carried out by choosing a small sample of DHPs (n=20), who provided their views on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter. Amendments from the participants were considered and incorporated into the questionnaire. After in-depth discussion, questionnaire was finalized by the authors and subsequently a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 50 DHPs by using modified version of the questionnaire to ensuring comprehensibility and reliability.

The knowledge was assessed at three different levels (yes, no, I do not know), and a score of 1 was allocated when the answers to questions were in agreement with the CDC guidelines. Therefore, the score for knowledge ranged between 0 (all wrong answers) to 11 (all correct answers). A cut off level of <7 were set for poor knowledge and \u22657 for good knowledge. Attitude was assessed at three possible levels (very strong, strong and null). The responses very strong and strong were assigned a score of 5 and null response was scored at 1 point. Thus, the aggregate score ranged between 11(all null score) to 55 (all questions responded as strong or very strong). A cut off level of <35 was set for negative attitude and \u226535 for positive attitude.

This discrepancy in the knowledge could be explained by the fact that the present study was conducted during the outbreak of MERS and the referenced studies were carried out in the year 2005 and 2010, since those time lots of advancements have been made in the information-technology in spread of health alerts. There has been increase in the internet access and usage among dental professionals to receive information about infection control (11). Moreover, now a day\u2019s internet is widely available and utilized to gain knowledge on evolving disease by many health care professionals including DHPs (12). Educational materials posted on the website of the ministry of health during the outbreak of MERS CoV could be one of the major sources of knowledge among health professionals including DHPs. Moreover, individualized text messages sent by the relevant professional agencies to their registered health professionals could be the source of this knowledge. In addition, seminar, symposium and research articles could be the source of knowledge about isolation precautions among dental health professionals during the MERS outbreak (4). All above mentioned factors could have played role in increasing knowledge of isolation precautions among DHPs. Even though some knowledge gaps have been identified in the present study such as; distance at which mask should be worn while approaching the patient under droplet precautionary care and wearing mask while entering room of patients with chickenpox or measles requiring further information.",

This high level of correlation could be due to the recent educational campaigns targeted towards MERS prevention programs by relevant authorities in KSA. Thus it can be speculated that continuous exposure of DHPs to the various educational programs which emphasize the importance of implementing CDC guidelines are more likely to use information gathered in their practice (13). Additionally, DHPs with more positive attitudes are motivated to explore more information to increase their understanding of isolation precautions. The reason for such correlation could be described by the theory of Reasoned Action, which states that the individual\u2019s intention to a specific behaviour is a function of their attitude towards that behaviour (14).",
