Human rhinoviruses are generally associated with the common cold and mild upper respiratory infections,3 but can also cause severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts (including lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) or patients with chronic pulmonary diseases.4, 5, 6, 7 Unlike respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses, HRV can cause respiratory illness throughout the year, but peak incidence occurs in early autumn and spring in temperate climates.6\n",

Sixteen of the 20 samples that clustered as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 ML tree segregated as A in the 5\u2032UTR analysis, as did some of the early, well\u2010characterized HRV C strains from New York (EU840952 and DQ875932),23, 26 San Francisco (EF077279 and EF077280),25 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (EF582387)11 and China (GQ223227).15 Twelve of 28 sequences with only UTR sequences also segregated along with the above\u2010mentioned reference C strains, branching in two major subgroups within HRV A. These have been labelled in this study as C/A, clustering with C strains, but grouping as A in the 5\u2032UTR region: these formed 30% of the clinical sequences. Huang et al.15 reported similar clustering of field strains in their study and designated the above C strains (EU840952, DQ875932, EF077279, EF077280, GQ223227 and EF582387) as Ca, a subspecies of HRV C that clustered differently to HRV A, HRV B and HRV C in the UTR. They further showed that HRV Ca subspecies were formed from interspecies recombination in the 5\u2032UTR region. Similar inconsistent clustering of field strains as compared to VP4/VP2 was also reported in the 3D polymerase\u2010coding region as well as 5\u2032UTR region.30 Three discordant branching events were seen in our analyses. MS07\u201018 (identity to A65) in one branch and MS06\u20103 along with HRV A12 in another branch segregated as A in the VP4/VP2 analysis, but localized within the Ca subspecies in the 5\u2032UTR analysis.

It is also difficult to compare the findings when different groups have used different genes. The 5\u2032UTR, VP4/VP2 and VP1 coding regions have been previously used to characterize genotypes. Kiang et al.14 compared both the 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 sequences of reference strains and clinical isolates (samples that showed CPE in W1\u201038 cells and/or human foetal diploid lung cells) and demonstrated that the 5\u2032UTR was discriminatory and was able identify the isolate as a single prototype strain. VP4/VP2 and VP1 regions are more variable than the conserved 5\u2032UTR, hence the difficulty in designing universal diagnostic primers.33 McIntyre et al.34 found that while branching orders of VP1, VP4/VP2 and 3D pol trees were identical, greater than 60% of C variants in their study showed recombination with A sequences in the 5\u2032UTR. They were able to map two recombination hot spots in the 5\u2032UTR region. The amplification of the VP1 coding region is rather difficult, requiring culture isolates and multiple sets of primers.26, 34 The clustering of HRV C as C and C/A when 5\u2032UTR region was included in the analysis (Figs 1 and 3) in our study may suggest that they are true C species that showed recombination with A in the 5\u2032UTR.",

Using only cell culture isolates rather than clinical samples to study the variation in phylogenetic relationship among field isolates may not be entirely accurate as cell lines generally favour the selection of certain virus strains, failing to detect other fastidious strains.
