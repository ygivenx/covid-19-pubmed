Despite the proven usefulness of peak VO2, achieving quality and consistency of data in children remains a challenge. Peak VO2 is developmentally divergent, varying with age, maturity and sex, and is highly correlated with body size and composition [10, 11]. It has been convention to scale peak VO2 by simply dividing absolute peak VO2 (mL. min-1) by body mass (ratio scaling). This however, results in a different pattern of development in peak VO2 in comparison to absolute peak VO2, with absolute peak VO2 in boys increasing with age, but ratio-scaled peak VO2 remaining unchanged [12]. Similarly in girls, increases in absolute peak VO2 are noted with increasing age until a levelling off in puberty, but ratio-scaled peak VO2 declines with age [12].",

Theoretically, physiological variables should be scaled for size using the general allometric equation to derive the appropriate size power function (y/xb) and thereby providing a more appropriate interpretation of size-related (xb) changes in physiologic function (y) [14]. The development of peak VO2 has been described using allometric scaling (log-linear analysis of covariance with body mass as the covariate) in Caucasian children and adolescents, and the same developmental pattern as absolute peak VO2 has been noted with age i.e., peak VO2 increases in boys with age, whereas in girls it increases until about 14 years of age when a leveling off is observed [15]. In a recent study, z score equations targeted to remove the effect of body size for peak VO2 in a group of healthy children in Canada has also been presented [16].",

At this point the speed was held constant and the gradient increased by 1% every minute until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate was monitored continuously during the test. Participants wore a comfortably fitted facemask (Hans Rudolph paediatric large size, 8950 series) and breath-by breath gas samples were collected and analyzed throughout the test using the Medgraphics CPX/DTM metabolic cart (Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN), calibrated prior to each test. Peak VO2 was determined when two of the following three conditions were reached: 1) a respiratory exchange ratio (RER)>1.0, 2) heart rate within 5% of age predicted maximum, 3) the participant was exhausted and refused to carry on despite strong verbal encouragement [22].",

A log-linear regression model was constructed using log (peak VO2) as the dependent and log (body weight) as independent variables. The interaction effects of age and sex were tested and found to significantly modulate the association between body mass and peak VO2, justifying the need for sex and age specific exponents. Therefore, allometric scaling was done separately for 4 different subgroups: (1) younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males; (2) older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) males; (3) younger females (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) and (4) older females (aged from 12 to 16.99 years). Outliers were identified using the least median of squares eliminator and removed from analyses [26]. Regression diagnostics were performed to ensure the models were appropriate [27]. Shapiro-Wilks normality test was used to evaluate the normality of the residuals. Homoscedasticity was assessed by plotting the standardized residuals against the standardized predicted value. The resulting beta coefficients were used as the allometric exponents. Peak VO2 can then be allometrically scaled using the equation:\nallometricallyscaledpeakVO2=unscaledpeakVO2bodymassexponent",

The linear (x), second-order (x2) and third-order (x3) effects of age, height and weight were tested and the resulting regression equations were used to predict peak VO2. Subjects with the resulting standardised predicted VO2 greater than 3 or less than -3 were considered as outliers and were excluded. As the variance of the residual values varied with body size and the variations are different between sexes and age groups, age- and sex-specific models were established to predict the standard deviation with body size using the method suggested by Altman [28]. First, linear regression was used to examine the association between the absolute value of the residual values and body size. Since the residual values were normally distributed, the absolute values of the residual values had a half-normal distribution. The mean of a half-normal distribution is \u221a(2/\u03c0). The SD of the residuals can be estimated as the product of the mean of the absolute residuals and \u221a(\u03c0/2). It follows that the predicted values from the regression of the absolute residuals on body size multiplied by \u221a(\u03c0/2) would be the estimates of SD of the signed residual, and hence of peak VO2. As a result, two regression models were developed for each sex and age group, one for the prediction of peak VO2 and the other for the prediction of SD. Z scores were calculated using the following formula:\nZscore=unscaledpeakVO2-predictedpeakVO2predictedSD",
