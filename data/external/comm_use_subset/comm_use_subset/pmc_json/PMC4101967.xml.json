The PRRS clinical signs include respiratory disorders, abortion in pregnant sows, and variable mortality in piglets. PRRS was first identified in the USA in 1987 and subsequently in Europe. The causative agent of the disease is the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the Arteriviridae family in the order Nidovirales [3]. According to the genetic differences, PRRSV is grouped into two genotypes: European (Type 1) and North American (Type 2), represented by Lelystad virus (LV) and VR-2332 strains, respectively.",

Interferons are major components of inmate immunity and have diverse biological functions including antiviral activity, antiproliferative activity, stimulation of T cell cytotoxic activity, and modulation of immune response [8]. There are three types of interferons. In human, type I interferons include IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, and IFN-\u03c9 [9, 10]. In addition, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03c4, and IFN-\u03b6 (or Limitin) have been identified as type I IFNs in swine, ruminant, and mice, respectively [11]. Almost all cell types are capable of producing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2; however, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are considered to be the major source of IFN-\u03b1 production during viral infection [12, 13]. Type II IFN contains only IFN-\u03b3, whose production is restricted to activated T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages [14]. Type III IFNs comprise IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 (also known as interleukin- (IL-) 29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, resp.), which are mainly generated by dendritic cells [11]. Considering the major roles in antiviral response by type I IFNs, we focus on this type of IFNs and discuss the PRRSV-mediated interference with their production and signaling.",

The PRRSV suppression of IFN induction correlates with the virus replication. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are thought to be the major source of IFN-\u03b1 in vivo. PRRSV fails to induce porcine pDCs to produce IFN-\u03b1, while pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TGEV stimulated the pDCs to synthesize IFN-\u03b1 [26, 27]. Moreover, presence of PRRSV markedly reduced the typical IFN-\u03b1 response of pDCs to TGEV or Toll-like receptor 9 agonist. Loving et al. showed that PRRSV replicated in monocyte-derived DCs but not lung DCs and the response of both cell types to PRRSV was only limited to IFN-\u03b2 transcription [28]. Additionally, for MARC-145 cells PRRSV replication also significantly inhibited the dsRNA-induced type I IFN expression [29\u201331]. These data suggest that PRRSV infection directly interferes with type I IFN induction in vivo and in vitro.",

IFN-\u03b2 promoter reporter assay was performed in HEK293T cells in the study. The result showed that nsp1 and its two cleavage products, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, inhibited the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (p125-Luc) and an artificial promoter containing three IRF3 binding sites (p55-CIB-Luc) after SV40 stimulation. PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 blocked the induction of IFN-\u03b2 at downstream of IRF3 activation but had no effect on the phosphorylation and translocation of IRF3. It suggested that nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 may have a direct effect on the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter inside the nucleus. Kim et al. showed that nsp1 inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus but had no effect on IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [30]. Immunoprecipitation with anti-IRF3 antibody found that interaction between CBP and IRF3 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells or nsp1-transfected HeLa cells was weaker than in cells treated with polyI:C alone [30]. The expression of nsp1 also enhanced CBP degradation, which can be rescued by MG132 treatment, a proteasome inhibitor. No interaction between nsp1 and CBP was found. The process is independent of the PCP activity of nsp1 [30]. Beura et al. showed that nsp1\u03b2 interfered with IRF3 signaling pathway by inhibiting dsRNA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [31]. The discrepancy is possibly because an nsp1\u03b2 that is 27-residue longer than its authentic form was used in Beura's study. Another possible reason is that different PRRSV strains were used as a couple of other studies showed that PRRSV replication significantly blocked dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation in MARC-145 cells [38, 39]. And nsp1 was also found to downregulate IRF3 protein level and inhibit its phosphorylation [39]. In our laboratory, we observed that PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells led to reduction of IRF3 protein level (unpublished data). Luo et al. [38] showed PRRSV blocked IFN-\u03b2 production and IRF3 nuclear translocation via significantly inhibiting activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I signaling pathway.",

The residue F176 played a role in both TLR3 signaling and RIG-I signaling pathways [41]. Double mutations K130A/R134A (type 1 PRRSV) or K124A/R128A (type 2 PRRSV) in a highly conserved motif of nsp1\u03b2, GKYLQRRLQ, dampened the nsp1\u03b2 inhibition of IFN induction [42].

Sequencing analysis indicated that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS MLV with an identity of 99.8% at the nucleotide level [47]. There were a total of 28 nucleotide (nt) variations when compared to VR-2332, resulting in 14 amino acid changes scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 has 15 unique nucleotides. Yet the mechanism of this strain inducing IFNs is not known and it is intriguing to note that the first 4.6 kb of its genome is identical to VR-2332. Its nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 proteins should be able to inhibit IFN induction. We hypothesize that the unique nucleotides in A2MC2 genome resulting in special RNA structures or unique dsRNA formation during early viral replication could evoke IFN production. It is worth to note that the induction of IFNs is dose dependent. The virus is able to replicate when the inoculum is at less than 0.1 MOI, which induces limited IFNs that cannot suppress the virus replication [47]. A2MC2 infection of pigs resulted in earlier onset and higher level neutralizing antibody against homologous and heterologous strain than MLV vaccine strain that is highly homologous in sequence [48].",

This receptor binding activates Janus kinases (JAK), which phosphorylates both the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers, followed by interaction with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and subsequently formation of heterotrimers, also known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3).

Immunoprecipitation with STAT1 or STAT2 antibody for MARC-145 cell lysates was performed and the result showed no significant difference for STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer formation between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected cells. Further study showed that the nuclear translocation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer was blocked. PRRSV infection of PAM cells also blocks JAK/STAT signaling shown by reduction of ISG expression after stimulation with external IFN-\u03b1, while a vaccine strain Ingelvac PRRS MLV had little effect, possible due to its less efficient replication in the primary cells [54].",

PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 was found to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and significantly inhibit the expression of ISGs [54]. By observing STAT1-GFP distribution under fluorescence microscopy, Chen et al. [32] noticed that STAT1-GFP accumulated in cytoplasm in HEK293T cells with nsp1\u03b2 expression. Further studies on nsp1\u03b2 revealed that it induced the degradation of karyopherin-alpha1 (KPNA1, also called importin-alpha5), which is known to mediate the nuclear import of ISGF3 [56]. The N-terminal domain of nsp1\u03b2 was involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1. Residue 19 of nsp1\u03b2 was found to be essential in inducing KPNA1 degradation and inhibiting IFN-mediated signaling as the residue change from valine to isoleucine diminished the suppressive effect. Notably, PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells by VR-2332 and VR-2385 also reduces KPNA1 expression, whereas infection by Ingelvac PRRS MLV does not. MLV nsp1\u03b2 has no effect on KPNA1 expression or IFN signaling but gains the suppressive function when residue 19 is changed to valine [56].",

In addition, type I IFNs are proinflammatory cytokines. The protective effect of IFNs in vivo may be context dependent. The IFNs in proper amount at right site and time should be protective. Otherwise, its elevation might be a consequence of inflammation during PRRSV infection.
