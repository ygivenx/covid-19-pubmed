While vaccines remain the most effective public health strategy for prevention [4,5], antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir, could play an important role in the response to the early phases of a pandemic, if available in sufficient quantities. However, like other antiviral agents, the emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility to the NAI is inevitable during treatment [1]. To date, strains with altered susceptibility to NAI have been recovered from approximately 1% of immunocompetent adult patients [6] and up to 18% of pediatric patients [7]. In addition, oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses with the H274Y mutation have been reported from patients during oseltamivir treatment [8,9].",

Sequencing often serves as a 'gold standard' for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, drug resistance mutations or virus/bacterial typing [15,16]. However, as sequencing is cumbersome, expensive and less likely to detect low prevalence mutations (mutations consisting less than 30% of total populations) [17,18], newer alternative techniques such as real time PCR and RCA are being employed [9,15]. To establish molecular assays, positive controls are a prerequisite to ascertain specificity and sensitivity [19,20]. However, in many cases it is difficult and cumbersome to acquire appropriate positive controls. It is thus, important to mention that although the commercial oligonucleotide synthesis can generate long oligonucleotides (\u2265150 mers) and can serve as suitable controls, there are problems as the oligonucleotide length exceeds 100 nucleobases, the yield of desired products often becomes limited by side reactions and even modest inefficiencies within the stepwise chemical reactions can have large effects on the final yield [21].",

However, due to the low frequency of naturally occurring resistance mutations in influenza infected patients receiving NA inhibitor treatment, the highly pathogenetic nature of influenza A H5N1 strains, and the technical complexity and time consuming nature of generating of NA resistant strains in vitro, collection of all known resistance mutations as positive controls is challenging. Therefore, our approach utilizing the formation of oligonucleotide dimers between two commercially synthesised long single stranded DNA templates (~95 bases each), to generate ~170 bp double-stranded artificial DNA templates, containing resistance mutations is not only innovative, but a more molecularly feasible and durable. In this way, it offers significant advantages in synthesizing even longer double stranded DNA templates, which can be used as positive control templates in molecular diagnostics. In the present study, we have used these double stranded artificial DNA templates with all known genetic mutations associated with influenza A drug resistance as a positive control in the development of a ligase chain reaction (LCR) for detecting NA inhibitor drug resistance mutations in patient samples.",

One impediment to these techniques is the lack of availability of control templates carrying rare mutant variants/alleles or all relevant mutations, which can serve as positive controls in molecular or multiplex PCR assays simultaneously. In influenza studies, for example, several single nucleotide mutations are known to be associated with NA inhibitor resistance [24,25]. Many of these have been derived from different in vitro cultures, and currently naturally occurring NAI resistance appears to be uncommon in some strains. However, in the event of an influenza pandemic, the use of NAIs would dramatically increase and thus provide greater opportunities for resistance to emerge and spread. Therefore, rapid screening of these mutations, which would be of great benefit for patient treatment and the control of disease spread, should be available in a format that can facilitate simultaneous, rapid and bulk detection of drug resistance mutations. We were only able to source wild-type clinical isolates of influenza A H3N2; known resistant clinical strains were unavailable. Given that highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 can only be handled in PC4 facilities, we had only limited access to influenza A H5N1 RNA. This was the main impediment to molecular assay development for the detection of drug resistance mutations. Thus, we endeavored to create artificial templates containing all previously identified single nucleotide mutations known for drug resistance within the neuraminidase gene of influenza virus. To address this issue, we produced long synthetic oligos containing known influenza A resistance mutations, and showed them to be effective as controls in LCR. Further, they can also serve as templates in real-time PCR and RCA [23,9].",

However, there were limitations as to the length of the oligonucleotide, which was generally unable to reach more than 130 bases. In many situations, for instance in the case of drug resistance mutations, nucleotide substitutions are often scattered within the target genome and thus require larger fragments as standard templates. Here, we took a novel approach to creating long artificial templates by taking advantage of primer-dimers, which are usually considered a common laboratory problem. The binding of two long artificially synthesized oligos generated a substrate for PCR and was used to create long double-stranded DNA molecules of about 170 bp. In most of the current diagnostic studies (especially based on real time PCR and RCA), 150-240 bp would be sufficient to serve a template controls. However, it is possible to use multiple long oligos to synthesize even longer double-stranded DNA and up to the full length of some important genes, if need be [26,27], which is a significant advantage over any similar technologies existing currently.",

Our approach has proven that the use of laboratory safe artificial templates can be a relatively cost effective, simple and efficient alternative to difficult to acquire material related to an infection or bioterrorism agent. The production of standard templates via the formation of oligo dimers and PCR using synthetic oligos does not require the use of viral or bacterial strains and oligos of any desired sequence can be made commercially. This approach may have the potential to produce a false-positive product due to contamination and therefore caution may be necessary. However, this problem can be solved by the introduction of exclusive restriction endonuclease digestion sites in the artificial template, which would allow for rapid confirmation of a false-positive result. Certain restriction endonuclease (SmaI and BamHI) can be used directly in the PCR buffer (without buffer exchange) and thus the PCR product from the control can be easily and rapidly distinguished from testing samples. In addition, the standard artificial template could be designed to be slightly smaller or larger in size, which would allow for direct visual identification of contamination with the synthetic control.",
