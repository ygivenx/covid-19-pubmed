            "text": "Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people annually\u2014millions in pandemic years. Several worldwide influenza outbreaks that arose in the last century claimed the lives of tens of millions; each of these pandemics was caused by the introduction of a viral strain with an HA subtype not found in other human influenza viruses. In February\u2013April 2009, a novel H1N1 strain\u2014a reassortant of human and swine influenza viruses with Eurasian avian-like swine viruses\u2014appeared in Mexico, followed by the United States and other nations. At present, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir have been efficacious against the current H1N1 strain of swine origin; however, the virus may acquire resistance to the available antiviral drugs. In fact, the incidence rate of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses in the United State increased from 0.7% in the 2006\u20132007 influenza season to 98.5% in the 2008\u20132009 influenza season [1]. Although vaccines are also available for the prevention and control of influenza virus infection, they need to be frequently revised\u2014typically every 1\u20133 years in the case of seasonal influenza vaccines\u2014to accommodate mutations in the HA and NA proteins of the circulating viruses (antigen drift). In addition, it has recently been reported that in response to variation in neutralizing antibody pressure between individuals, the influenza A virus evolves by adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid substitutions throughout the HA globular domain, many of which simultaneously alter antigenicity [2]. Host-oriented mechanisms involved in influenza infection, rather than viral proteins, should therefore be envisaged as promising targets for the development of novel, potent therapeutics that are effective irrespective of viral subtype.",

            "text": "Indeed, several genome-wide screenings succeed to identify host proteins that participate in every step of influenza virus infection [3], [4], [5], [6]. These include signaling molecules related to viral replication, innate immune responses, and apoptosis, as well as signal transduction pathways regulating more fundamental and physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Among them, the family of lipid kinases phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3Ks), a key regulator in many cellular processes [7], is one of the commonly listed host factors across the literature [3], [4], [5], [6], indicating the crucial role of this protein in influenza virus infection. Accordingly, it was reported that the multifunctional viral non-structural protein (NS1) binds directly to the regulatory subunit p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, and stimulates the lipid kinase activity of the p85-associated catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Although this PI3K activation is apparently of importance in promoting efficient virus replication at a late step of the infection [11], the underlying mechanisms by which PI3K contributes to viral infection remain controversial. In fact, it was paradoxically reported that PI3K inhibition is effective only in the initial stage of infection [13], [14], indicating a bivalent role for PI3K in both early and late stages of infection.",

            "text": "The pathway of influenza transmission is a multistep process involving adsorption of viral HA to sialylated host surface proteins, entry of the virus into cells by endocytosis, and trafficking from early to late endosomes. The viruses then fuse with the membrane of late endosomes to release the viral genes necessary for replication [15], [16], [17]. A growing body of evidence shows that influenza viruses undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. However, the virus can still enter the cells even with inhibition of clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that influenza viruses infect cells through an additional clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic pathway [18]. We have recently reported that PI3K bound to Ras is preferentially translocated to the endosome and activated in this subcellular compartment; however, a role for this binding in the endosome has yet to be determined [19]. In this study, we demonstrate that Ras\u2013PI3K signaling plays an indispensable role in the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis and influenza virus entry.",

            "text": "In order to test whether PI3K participates in the regulation of endocytosis, we first prepared mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type mice and mice deficient in Pik3cg (the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K\u03b3, a subtype of PI3K). Clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis in these cells was assessed by uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin and dextran, respectively. The treatment of wild-type MEFs with the pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced the uptake of dextran, but not that of transferrin (Figure 1A, B), confirming that PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, as reported previously [20]. Pik3cg-deficiency in MEFs also displayed an inhibitory effect on dextran uptake; however, the inhibitory effect observed in the mutant MEFs was significantly less than that of LY294002-treated cells (Figure 1A, P = 1.2\u00d710\u22127, LY294002-treated Pik3cg\n+/+ vs. Pik3cg\n\u2212/\u2212). Because PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 are expressed in these mutant cells [21], the difference in capacity for dextran uptake between LY294002-treated wild-type and Pik3cg-deficient MEFs could be accounted for by the remaining activity of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subtypes of PI3K in the Pik3cg\n\u2212/\u2212 cells. Interestingly, the PI3K\u03b3 K251E mutant, which fails to bind to Ras [22] and hence to translocate to the endosome via activated Ras (Figure S1A, B), was unable to display a compensatory effect, unlike its wild-type counterpart (Figure 1A), while the expression levels were shown to be comparable by immunoblotting (Figure S1C). Given that the mutants lacking Ras-binding retain the catalytic activity [23], [24], this result demonstrates the significance of Ras-mediated activation of PI3K in the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis.",

The efficacy of transfection, in which lipid-conjugated plasmid DNA is thought to be transmitted into cells via fluid phase, clathrin-independent endocytosis [25], was significantly impaired in Pik3cg-deficient MEFs. This impairment was rescued by the expression of wild-type PI3K\u03b3 but not by expression of the mutant PI3K\u03b3 (Figure 2A). In contrast, gene transfer by electroporation was not affected by any of the tested conditions (Figure 2B), indicating that endocytosis-mediated events, but not protein expression, are specifically disrupted in Pik3cg\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs.",

Immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody against the influenza nucleoprotein NP revealed that the total number of adsorbed virus particles was comparable among the tested conditions (Figure S2A); however, the ratio of particles colocalized with Rab proteins to the total number of particles, which is expected to represent the virus entry rate, was reduced in LY294002-treated wild-type MEFs, Pik3cg-deficient MEFs, and knockout MEFs expressing the K251E mutant (Figure 3C and Figure S2B, C). These findings are consistent with the results of dextran uptake (see Figure 1A). The delivery of viral particles from early to late endosomes, which can be analyzed by calculating the ratio of virus particles colocalized with CFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab7 to the total number of internalized particles, was concomitantly retarded in knockout cells and in mutant PI3K\u03b3-expressing cells (Figure S2C). This suggests that Ras\u2013PI3K signaling also modulates virus trafficking from early to late endosomes via the regulation of endosomal maturation (see Figure 1C). The PI3K inhibitor promoted retention in early endosomes more efficiently than Pik3cg ablation (Figure S2C, P = 4.1\u00d710\u22123), indicating that other subtypes of PI3Ks also play a role in viral trafficking.",

To examine activity of endogenous Ras, we used the Bos pull-down method in which GTP-bound, active Ras is recovered from cell lysates by its preferential avidity to the GST-fused Ras-binding domain (RBD) of c-Raf1 [26]. As shown in Figure 5A, B, Ras activation was efficiently promoted at 30 minutes after PR8 infection, irrespective of the presence or absence of PI3K\u03b3. Ras activation by PR8 could also be observed in Cos-1 cells (Figure 5C). In addition, expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras S17N) inhibited influenza virus infection, whereas expression of its wild-type counterpart rather enhanced the infection (Figure 5D, E), together demonstrating a requirement for Ras in influenza virus infection. We further assessed the phosphorylation status of Akt, a commonly used marker of PI3K activation, by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt, S473). Surprisingly, although influenza infection was definitely inhibited in Pik3cg-deficient cells, Akt phosphorylation was induced by virus exposure for 6 hours (Figure 5A). Upon PDGF stimulation, essentially similar Ras and Akt activation was observed, even in the absence of PI3K\u03b3 (Figure 5F), which is consistent with a previous report that the Akt phosphorylation level induced by extracellular stimuli is not altered by ablation of PI3K\u03b3 [27]. Moreover, although the PI3K binding to Ras is critical for influenza virus infection (see Figure 3A, B), the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation were apparently distinct from those of Ras activity (Figure 5B). In fact, kinetics of Akt phosphorylation induced by influenza virus infection are reported to be in a manner dependent on cell contexts and viral strains [13]. We therefore postulated that PI3K activation is disturbed in a manner specific for subcellular localization and that in our system Akt phosphorylation at the whole-cell level is an inappropriate indicator of PI3K activity at such an early stage of infection.",

Akt-PH recognizes the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) [and its hydrolytic product PI(3,4)P2], therefore this molecule tagged with fluorescent proteins gives a measure of PI3K activation with spatiotemporal precision by its translocation to specific subcellular organelles. Because a dominant negative effect of the expression of this protein on influenza infection has been reported [13], we carefully identified an expression level of PH-GFP that would avoid inhibition of infection (Figure S3A, B). Under this condition, accumulation of PH-GFP reflecting PI3K activation promoted by influenza virus infection could be observed not only at the plasma membrane but also in vesicular structures, in which influenza virus particles and Rab5 were colocalized (Figure 6A). Given that expression of Ras S17N, as well as LY294002 treatment, inhibited this colocalization, we can say that PIP3 accumulation in the early endosome requires Ras in addition to PI3K activity per se. Interestingly, whereas virus particles could localize in both early (Rab5 positive) and late (Rab7 positive) endosomes, the fluorescent protein-tagged PH domain could do so only in early endosomes (Figure 6A, B). These findings suggest that PI3K is also required for the transition from early endosomes to late endosomes where PI3K activity is already diminished; inhibition of PI3K activity actually resulted in the retention of viral particles in early endosomes (see Figure S2C). Furthermore, upon viral infection, Ras colocalized with viral particles, the PH domain, and Rab5 in a manner dependent on Ras and PI3K activities (Figure 6C). Given that Ras is indispensable for activating PI3K in the endosomes [19], these results together underscore an important role for the Ras\u2013PI3K pathway in PIP3 production in early endosomes upon viral infection.",

We hereby show that Ras-mediated PI3K activation is mainly required for virus entry during infection. This is consistent with reports that PI3K inhibition is effective in reducing titers of progeny viruses only when the inhibitor is applied earlier than 4 h.p.i., whereas the treatment at 4 h.p.i. or later is not able to display this effectiveness anymore [13], [14]. Given that lack of Ras\u2013PI3K binding failed to localize PI3K in the endosomes (Figure S1A, B), Ras plays a determining role in the virus-induced, transient activation of PI3K in the endosomes. Notwithstanding this PI3K activation, phosphorylation of the major PI3K downstream molecule Akt at this early stage was not significant, and became prominent only at post-entry stages (Figure 5B). These kinetics of Akt phosphorylation are consistent with a previous report, where transient Akt phosphorylation is detected with lesser amplitude than that observed at a late stage, in a manner specific on cell contexts and viral strain [13]. These observations regarding the small amplitude of Akt phosphorylation may be accounted for by the restricted activation of PI3K in early endosomes, as we presented here, and the proportion of Akt activated by Ras-PI3K to total Akt can determine the extent of phosphorylated Akt detected by immunoblotting. Alternatively, given that the expression of wild-type or dominant-negative forms of Akt does not significantly alter virus entry [13], [14], PI3K in the endosomes may utilize PIP3 binding factors other than Akt to regulate virus entry.",

Because the time course of this Akt activation is apparently different from that of Ras activation, slow Akt activation may be independent of Ras, but rather mediated by the viral protein NS1 through direct binding to the PI3K regulatory subunit p85\u03b2 [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].

The first step of influenza virus infection is adsorption to sialylated proteins on the cell surface. Thus, the type of sialylation of cell surface proteins is of great importance to determine virus host specificity; however, none of the sialylated proteins has been identified as a single specific receptor for this virus to date. On the other hand, it has recently been reported that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor is a sialic acid-independent receptor for influenza viruses in macrophages [33]. Given that the PR8 strain, used in this study and capable to activate Ras, cannot bind to the macrophage cell surface molecules, including this receptor, after sialidase treatment [33], signal transducers from influenza virus to Ras should be sialylated proteins. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor is in a list of host factors implicated in influenza virus infection in several genome-wide studies [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, other acceptor mechanism(s) are likely to be dominant; our preliminary experiments show that the receptor inhibitor produced marginal effects on the infection and the level of phosphorylated tyrosine in the total cell lysate was not strikingly altered by the infection (data not shown).",

One may raise a concern about the use of fibroblasts as a model because the expression pattern of this molecule has been thought to be restricted within leukocytes. However, recent accumulating evidence indicates that PI3K\u03b3 functions and is expressed in a much wider range of cell contexts than previously believed; e.g. endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts, and a vast majority of solid cancer cells [36], [37], [38], [39]. In the present study, the genetic ablation in fibroblasts indeed resulted in a decreased endocytic ability and influenza infectivity (Figures 1\u2013\n3). Moreover, a similar inhibitory effect on these phenomena was also observed by the PI3K\u03b3-specific inhibitor AS605240 in several cell lines tested (data not shown), proving that PI3K\u03b3 is apparently indispensable for operating influenza virus entry in a variety of cell lines including fibroblasts. Other subtypes of PI3K including class IA (PI3K\u03b1 and \u03b2) may also participate in influenza virus infection because the pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 achieved more efficient inhibitions than pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PI3K\u03b3.",

In addition, virus internalization after adsorption is a relatively non-specific process and is conserved over a range of viral subtypes and species. It therefore presents a promising target for achieving potent therapeutics with a broad spectrum of efficacy and a lower rate of resistance. To this end, a number of studies have attempted to identify the mechanism by which influenza enters cells and have implicated clathrin-mediated endocytosis, through which about 60% of the virus particles are indeed internalized [40], [41], [42]. However, expression of a dominant-negative form of Eps15 and knockdown of epsin 1, both of which are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, do not hamper influenza virus infection [41], [43]. In contrast, ablation of the Ras\u2013PI3K interaction restrained influenza virus internalization via inhibiting clathrin-independent endocytosis (Figures 1 and 3), underscoring Ras\u2013PI3K-mediated, clathrin-independent endocytosis as one of the key pathways of influenza virus entry, whereas clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a supportive one. Our finding may also be applied to other viruses, apart from influenza viruses, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or dengue virus, both of which are known to infect via clathrin-independent endocytosis [44], [45].",

            "text": "In summary, the Ras\u2013PI3K interaction, identified here as a host-oriented mechanism for influenza internalization, is implicated in very specific cellular phenomena, including clathrin-independent endocytosis and endosomal maturation, and is separate from clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which is necessary for a number of important biological events, such as receptor downregulation and low-density lipoprotein incorporation. In fact, adult mice deficient in Ras binding to PI3Ks are healthy [23]. Inhibiting this signaling pathway could lead to the development of a useful, well-tolerated prevention strategy against a variety of viral infections, which would aid in the development of effective countermeasures against viral pandemics.",
