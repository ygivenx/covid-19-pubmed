In the last 15 years, the GII.4 HuNoVs have been responsible for the majority of HuNoV outbreaks, possibly due to several viral and host factors that have been reviewed recently [8]: i) the broader binding of host receptor to GII.4 HuNoVs, ii) incomplete herd immunity against GII.4 or its variants, and iii) higher mutation rate of their polymerases. In the viral capsid protein, the P2 domain is the most protruding and variable region. It is believed to recognize host cellular receptors and to contribute to establishment of viral infection. Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are considered as cellular receptors or co-receptors that determine host susceptibility to certain HuNoVs. Individuals of blood type A or O (H) of secretors were more susceptible to GI.1/Norwalk/1968/US virus infection than individuals who were non-secretors or secretors of blood type B [9], [10]. However, an emerging HuNoV, GII.12 strain did not bind to HBGAs when tested in vitro\n[11]. These observations imply a host factor affecting infection by certain genogroups or genotypes of HuNoV.",

The young and elderly are also at risk, due to their high exposure rates to HuNoV infection in community settings (child care centers, nursing homes, hospitals, etc). Notably, the common use of statin medications, which lowers serum cholesterol levels and prevents cardiovascular disease, is a significant risk factor for exacerbating HuNoV disease severity and increasing the related fatality rates [14].

Most HuNoV-infected Gn pigs shed virus in feces.

The longer fecal HuNoV shedding in Gn pigs infected with the GII.12 HS206 strain was similar to that observed in human cases [11]. Also, like humans possessing secretor phenotype, Gn pigs express A or H1 HBGA on enterocytes. Different HBGA phenotypes (A or H) were shown to influence susceptibility of Gn pigs to HuNoV infection [19].",

After statin treatment, reduced cellular cholesterol levels are followed by high expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene that compensates for the lower cellular cholesterol levels. These results indicated that cholesterol pathways may be associated with enhanced replication of HuNoV in vitro, although the related mechanisms are unclear. Statins are also involved in a variety of immune responses and are immunosuppressive. They inhibit major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II expression on antigen presenting cells in mice, promote the generation of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells in mice, and impair lipopolysaccharide-induced toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory responses in human embryonic kidney-293 cells (HEK-293) [21], [22], [23].",

Thus, we further investigated if simvastatin inhibits the capacity of macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs) to produce IFN-\u03b1 after stimulation with poly (I:C), which triggers TLR3-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b1. In general, IFN-\u03b1 was not detected in culture supernatants of macrophages or DCs treated with either simvastatin only or mock. In porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs), IFN-\u03b1 levels (50.0\u00b113.4 U/ml) released in simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated PAMs were significantly lower than those (173.3\u00b148.1 U/ml) of poly (I:C) only-treated PAMs at 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment (P<0.05) (Fig. 5A). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived macrophages responded less to treatment with 50 \u00b5g/ml of poly (I:C), as compared to PAMs treated with 25 \u00b5g/ml of poly (I:C) (Table 1), possibly due to lower ratios of harvested adherent macrophages from PBMC. Similar to the observations for PAMs, significantly lower IFN-\u03b1 levels (68.9\u00b112.9 U/ml) were observed in simvastatin-treated, enriched intestinal DCs at 12 hours after poly (I:C) treatment (P<0.05), as compared with those (93.3\u00b115.3 U/ml) after poly (I:C) treatment alone (Table 1). The mean percentages (\u00b1 SEM) of TLR3+ cells (3.22\u00b10.85%, n = 6) from simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated intestinal macrophages at 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment were significantly lower (P<0.01), as compared to that (6.56\u00b10.47%, n = 6) from poly (I:C) alone.

Therefore, we investigated whether fecal HuNoV shedding, i.e. HuNoV replication in the gut of infected Gn pigs, was altered by treatment with IFN-\u03b1. Oral treatment of Gn pigs with natural human IFN-\u03b1 (nhIFN-\u03b1) [300 international unit (IU)/kg/day] reduced or curtailed virus shedding in treated animals during the treatment period (PID 1 to 4), compared to untreated animals (Fig. 7A\u2013C). The treatment significantly delayed the onset of virus shedding by 1.7 day in treated pigs, which began shedding at mean PID 3.0\u00b10.8, compared to mean PID 1.3\u00b10.2 in untreated pigs (P<0.05) (Fig. 7A). During the nhIFN-\u03b1 treatment period (PID 1 to 4), a significantly shorter duration of HuNoV shedding was observed in the nhIFN-\u03b1-treated pigs, which shed for a mean of 0.8\u00b10.5 days, compared to a mean of 2.0\u00b10.3 days in untreated pigs (P<0.05) (Fig. 7B). During the treatment period, a significantly lower qRT-PCR-positive rate of the fecal samples tested (P<0.01) was also observed in the nhIFN-\u03b1-treated pigs (3/16; 18.8%) than in the untreated pigs (12/16; 75%), with significantly lower viral RNA titers in the feces (4.88\u00b10.11 log10 GE/ml in the treated pigs vs. 5.06\u00b10.14 log10 GE/ml in the untreated pigs) (P<0.01) (Fig. 7C). However, at PID 5 to 18 after nhIFN-\u03b1-treatment was discontinued, significantly increased viral shedding titers were noted in the nhIFN-\u03b1-treated pigs (5.18\u00b10.08 log10 GE/ml), compared to the untreated pigs (4.92\u00b10.05 log10 GE/ml) (P<0.05) (Fig. 7C).

Further repeated studies in additional pigs are needed to investigate how termination of nhIFN treatment results in higher viral shedding titers post IFN-\u03b1 treatment.

We also verified that the increased infectivity of HuNoV may be associated with the inhibitory effect of statins on innate immunity (IFN-\u03b1). This observation might explain the exacerbated HuNoV disease and the related higher mortality described in statin-treated humans [14]. Because of the immunosuppressive effects, use of statins have been proposed for immunomodulatory therapy against severe influenza A virus infections in which large amounts of innate (IFN-\u03b1) cytokines are involved [24]. In addition, we showed that oral treatment with nhIFN-\u03b1 can curtail early HuNoV fecal shedding in the Gn pig model. Because no HuNoV vaccines are available, use of effective antivirals such as IFN-\u03b1 should be tested to control multiple genogroups and genotypes of HuNoVs, including the GII.4 variants that have emerged each year [25]. Our findings that HuNoV infectivity in Gn pigs can be enhanced by simvastatin treatment or reduced by oral treatment with nhIFN-\u03b1, suggest that Gn pigs are a useful model to test efficacy of antivirals against HuNoV.",

However, the different pathogenesis of MNV infection with its systemic spread raises concerns about extrapolation of these findings to the HuNoV restricted gastrointestinal infection. A chimpanzee model was recently established to evaluate the efficacy of VLP-derived vaccines against infection with GI or GII HuNoVs [26]. Chimpanzees developed serum antibody responses after intravenous injection of GI.1/Norwalk virus or intramuscular injection with Norwalk VLPs and were protected from GI.1/Norwalk virus challenge (but not GII HuNoV infection). The chimpanzee model, however, is compromised by the lack of availability of chimpanzees, and the finding that oral infection of chimpanzees with HuNoVs failed to induce gastroenteric disease comparable to human cases [26], as well as by the intravenous route required for viral challenge. In our study, although HuNoV infection of Gn pigs induced mild enteric disease, Gn pigs were susceptible to oral infection by the GII.4 HS194 strain, which reaffirms the results of our previous studies using a closely related GII.4 HuNoV (HS66 strain) [16], [17] and the emerging GII.12 HuNoV (HS206 strain) [11]. Fecal HuNoV shedding patterns in Gn pigs, with peak viral titers during an early stage of infection are also typical for other acute enteric viral infections in pigs, such as rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [27], [28]. However, how HuNoV shedding in infected Gn pigs is maintained for 2 or 3 weeks after viral inoculation is unclear and requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism are mainly mediated by hepatic enzymes, such as HMG-CoA reductase [29]. Statins act as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase and reduce production of cholesterol in the liver. As in humans, our study showed that statins lower serum cholesterol levels in Gn pigs, possibly due to similar cholesterol pathways between swine and humans as reported previously [30]. When hepatic cholesterol stores are depleted, the liver increases the expression of LDLR which leads to uptake of LDL from plasma to compensate for the lower cellular cholesterol levels. Several RNA viruses manipulate cholesterol pathways in diverse ways for more efficient viral infection and replication as exemplified for NoVs in comparion to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronavirus [20], [31], [32], [33]. For example, low cellular cholesterol levels (or high cellular LDLR expression) following statin treatment contributed to increased GI.1/Norwalk virus replication, as verified in an in vitro replicon system [20]. Our study also showed that increased LDLR expression levels in IPEC-J2 cells (a porcine jejunal cell line) treated with simvastatin might similarly contribute to enhanced HuNoV replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Our other ongoing in vitro studies also found that HuNoV RNA titers in supernatants or lysate samples of IPEC-J2 cells treated with simvastatin were slightly increased in trials using GII.12 HS206 strain compared to those of controls (without simvastatin), but did not differ significantly in cell cultures using the GII.4 HS194 strain. The latter was previously reported [34]. The data indicate a positive but inconsistent effect of simvastatin on HuNoV replication in vitro, possibly depending on the HuNoV strains or different environmental conditions for HuNoV replication in vitro versus in vivo. A paper describing more detailed and comprehensive in vitro cell culture findings is in preparation by Takanashi et al. (unpublished data, 2012). In addition to the cholesterol lowering effects, the inhibitory effects of statins on innate immunity also might influence the immunological and cellular microenvironment for more efficient HuNoV replication. In our study, simvastatin impaired TLR3-mediated innate immunity and inhibited production of IFN-\u03b1 induced by poly (I:C) in PAMs or intestinal DCs. These observations are similar to the results of an in vitro study using HEK-293 cells, showing the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on TLR4-mediated immune responses, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 [23]. Nevertheless, it is notable that observations for Gn pigs and humans infected with HuNoVs [14] are contrary to the effect of statins that reduced replication of HCV in replicon-harboring cells [31] and a positive correlation between cellular cholesterol levels and entry of coronaviruses [32] and of GV/MNV into host cells [33]. Further confirmatory data are needed to define the role of the cholesterol pathway in the pathogenesis of HuNoV.",

            "text": "Although simvastatin treatment inhibited IFN-\u03b1 production, we found that gene expression of IRF3 and NF\u03baB in simvastatin-treated PAMs was increased rather than being decreased. Because activation of NF\u03baB kinase is a shared property among TLRs, including TLR3 [35], simvastatin or its cellular byproducts could trigger other TLRs that stimulate NF\u03baB gene expression. Notably, at 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment, gene expression levels of IRF3 and NF\u03baB in poly (I:C) only-treated cells were reduced remarkably, as compared with other treatments or those at the earlier time-point. This observation could be explained by a cellular negative feedback effect to mediate production of IFN-\u03b1. It is also notable that a similar result did not occur in simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated cells, possibly due to reduced IFN-\u03b1 levels after simvastatin treatment. At least four families of transcription factors are activated by dsRNA and relate to TLR3: NF\u03baB, IRF-3, c-Jun, and activating transcription factor 2 [35]. Besides lowered TLR3 expression by macrophages after simvastatin treatment, which was thought to be mainly responsible for reduction of IFN-\u03b1 production in statin + poly (I:C)-treated cells, other TLR3- or IFN-mediated signaling pathways might be involved in the impaired innate immunity by simvastatin.",

            "text": "Type I IFNs are essential for early viral clearance and development of adaptive immune responses. As a crucial mediator of the innate antiviral immune responses, IFN-\u03b1 has been an effective antiviral treatment for viral infections, such as HCV and influenza [36], [37]. The signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1)-dependent IFN stimulation was essential for controlling murine NoV (MNV) infection. Although MNV did not cause disease in immunocompetent mice, oral MNV infection caused fatal systemic disease in mice lacking either type I and type II interferon receptors or STAT-1, which is critical for IFN signaling [15], [38]. Several studies have suggested that repeated oral treatment with nhIFN-\u03b1 may be effective in treating acute viral gastroenteritis related to coronavirus and rotavirus in domestic pigs [39], [40]. Similarly, our study showed that oral administration of nhIFN-\u03b1 inhibits infection by or replication of HuNoV, as fecal HuNoV shedding is curtailed in the Gn pig model. The nhIFN-\u03b1 is formulated to be stable at low pH of the stomach. Degradation of nhIFN-\u03b1 by a variety of intestinal enzymes appears to be slow enough to allow nhIFN-\u03b1 to reach some IFN-\u03b1 receptors of cells in mucosal lymphoid tissues of the oral cavity and intestine [41]. The therapeutic effectiveness of nhIFN-\u03b1 might be related to its immunostimulatory effects. Orally delivered nhIFN-\u03b1 promoted systemic innate immunity by increasing expression levels of innate immunity-related genes, such as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and TNF-\u03b1, and phagocytic capacity of phagocytes [42], [43]. Further studies with larger numbers of animals are needed to determine the most effective dose and regimen of nhIFN-\u03b1 to prevent or treat HuNoV infections, and to elucidate the immunological and molecular mechanisms related to the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b1. Based on the effectiveness of a combination of nhIFN-\u03b1 pre- and post-treatment, the nhIFN-\u03b1 treatments need to be tested therapeutically in future studies using the Gn pig model or in clinical trials. The mechanisms by which fecal virus shedding recurred and the increased viral RNA titers in nhIFN-treated Gn pigs compared to untreated pigs after nhIFN treatment was discontinued need to be investigated. However, we hypothesize that during the period of nhIFN treatment, IFN signaling pathways might be regulated by a negative feedback in some IFN producing cells in the intestine. Thus, on the termination of treatment such a distinct condition of the IFN system might hinder induction or production of IFN-\u03b1 in most IFN containing cells or its antiviral activity against HuNoV.",

Testing of nhIFN-\u03b1 as an antiviral for HuNoV using the Gn pig model also revealed that IFN-\u03b1 has potential as a HuNoV antiviral therapy. Development of HuNoV antivirals is important because HuNoVs cause large-scale epidemics with significant mortality in immunocompromised, elderly and young patients. Thus, the Gn pig model for HuNoV will allow testing of new treatment modalities for HuNoV infection and new knowledge on the antiviral mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity.",
