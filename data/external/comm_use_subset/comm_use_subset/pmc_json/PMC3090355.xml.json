Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors [2-4]. The zoonotic viruses can be categorized according to genotype; of the various classes of viruses, the RNA viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates [5]. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species [6,7]. The high mutation rate of envelope proteins [5] hinders the development of accurate vaccines, as does the great ability of the RNA viruses to infect host species in order to exploit host proteins for viral reproduction [8].",

Viral infection of a cell begins with attachment of the virus to the cell surface [6,10,11]. During attachment to the cell membrane, the viral envelope protein (a structural protein) interacts with the host-cell receptor protein(s) [12]. In non-envelope viruses, the capsid plays this role. The cell receptors that play a major role in viral attachment are predominantly membrane proteins of the immunoglobin superfamily [13-15]. The identification of virus-binding cellular receptors was rapidly accelerated in the late 1980s owing to developments in the use of monoclonal antibodies and molecular cloning techniques [15]. The various receptors that have been found are surface matrix structures containing carbohydrate, lipid, and protein moieties [1,16,17]. In some cases, viral attachment also exploits co-receptors. For example, HIV, which uses the CD4 molecule as its receptor, uses the CXCR4 and CCR5 co-receptors to strengthen the effectiveness of infection [1,14,18,19]. Similarly, hepatitis C virus utilizes CD81 as a receptor and LDLR as a co-receptor [20].",

In other words, the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor should be the major determinant of the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. Ordinary sequence alignment protocol tells us overall sequence similarity which we thought useful but insufficient because most receptors are membrane proteins and membrane proteins consist of distinctive hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Therefore, we analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species to predict the likelihood of transmission across species, including humans. To our best knowledge, this study is the first attempt to predict zoonosis through a simple analysis of receptor sequence similarities and differences. This method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.",

Similarly, for leukovirus, only Gallus gallus (chicken) is infected as a primary reservoir; because of the high transmission barrier, R. norvegicus and H. sapiens are not infected.

The results provide clear evidence that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well separated from those of other infection cases. From these observations, we conclude that receptor differences are a major contributing factor to the potential of a specific viral strain to cross species barriers for transmission. In other words, the species dependence of infection is indirectly related to the receptor sequence similarity. This finding implies that once the receptor sequences of the primary reservoir and possible hosts are known, we might be able to predict the likelihood of viral disease transmission.

The viruses whose groups were predicted using the discriminant analysis are shown in Table 2. The first virus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), uses Felis catus (domestic cat) as its primary host and CD4 as its receptor. According to the literature [22,23], FIV infection of humans is rare but has been reported. Our method categorized this case as near-infection (G = 3). The second virus, classical swine fever virus, is known to be non-zoonotic and was classified as such by our method (G = 2). Thirdly, the encephalomyocarditis virus infects S. scrofa but has been known to cause sporadic infections in H. sapiens; it was classified as group 1 (G = 1) by our method. Finally, the Lass virus is known to be zoonotic and was classified as group 1 (G = 1) by our method.",

This result is not surprising, because viral infection also inversely correlates with the inhibition of viral coat protein binding to the receptors. Importantly, we were able to establish this relationship at the amino acid sequence level, allowing for the prediction of possible human infection at an early stage of a viral outbreak, before the structures of viral coat proteins and receptors are known. Therefore, once the receptor sequences of primary reservoir and the potential host are known, the likelihood of viral infection can be predicted if the virus does not mutate too abruptly. Our simplistic approach needs further refinement because the complex processes of host tropism of viruses are largely ignored in our current method. For example, the process of host immune response could be included for better prediction of zoonosis. Although further refinements of our methods and analyses of larger databases are needed, this simple conceptual approach may be useful, even now, as a basic tool for the classification of zoonosis of new viral species.",

Receptor sequence data for each virus were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, and the research literature was examined to determine the specific species tropism of each virus [[25], http://www.ictvonline.org/].
