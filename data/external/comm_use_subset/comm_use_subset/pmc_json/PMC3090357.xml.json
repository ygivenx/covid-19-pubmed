            "text": "Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is an enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus classified in the family of Flaviviridae. HCV causes acute and chronic hepatitis infection which can eventually lead to permanent liver damage, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. It is estimated that three to four million people are infected with HCV every year [1]. HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor of just over 3000 amino acids. This polyprotein precursor is co- and posttranslationally processed by cellular (signal peptidase and signal peptide peptidase) and viral (NS2-3 and NS3-4A) proteases to yield four structural (Core, E1, E2 and P7) and six non structural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) proteins. HCV envelope is formed by E1 and E2 glycoprotein heterodimers which are essential for virus entry into cells [2]. HCV E1 and E2 fusion was enhanced at low pH, suggesting that HCV enters cells via the endosomal pathway and that E1 and/or E2 undergo conformational modifications that allow fusion of viral and cellular membranes [3].",

Current therapeutic options for hepatitis C are limited, especially for genotype 1. For genotypes 2 and 3, pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, can lead to a sustained virological response in up to 80% of patients [7]. However, this therapy is expensive and often associated with side effects that may lead to discontinuation of therapy [8]. Hemolytic anemia, cough, shortness of breath & treatogenicity are the most common adverse effect associated with ribavirin treatment, and muscle aches, fatigue & neuropsychiatric adverse effects of IFN-\u03b1 lead to premature cessation of therapy in 10 to 20% of patients [9,10]. Moreover, cost of interferon for 6 month treatment ranging from PKR 50,000 to 150,000 is beyond the financial range of most patients. Hence, there is a need to develop anti HCV agents, which are less toxic, more efficacious and cost-effective.",

            "text": "HCV entry is a multistep process requiring four cellular receptor, fusion and endocytosis. HCV fusion depends on E1 and E2, viral dose, and occurs within a specific pH range. Targeting pH dependent endocytosis is a useful tool to identify antiviral drugs against. A major advancement to look into HCV entry process was the development of HCVpp, consisting of native HCV envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, assembled onto retroviral core particles [3,22,23]. This system is potentially very powerful tool to identify and characterize molecules that block HCV entry. In this study, HCVpp of local HCV genotype 3a and 1a were produced to study early entry steps mediated by HCV envelope glycoproteins. This assay is based on the quantification of retroviral DNA synthesis, which occurs soon after the fusion of the retroviral particle with a cellular membrane. Presumably, this assay is only dependent on the entry steps mediated by the heterodimer E1E2 (binding, endocytosis, and fusion) and on the activity of the reverse transcriptase of the HCVpp retroviral core.",

Lysosomotropic agents such as Chloroquine and NH4Cl are weak bases which have a tendency to accumulate in these compartments. Lysosomotropic agents are captured by protonation inside the lysosomes and accumulate there (Figure 3). The ratio of intra/extra lysosomal concentrations of these substances is equal to the ratio of concentration of hydrogen ions in lysosomes and in their vicinity, i.e. 1 : 100 if we suppose that pH in lysosomes is 5 and in cytoplasm 7. The amount of the permeable form of lysosomotropic agents passing through the membrane depends on the substance pKa value and pH value of solution. The higher the pKa value, the lower the permeable form ratio. This has led to the assumption that the specific uptake of lysosomotropic substances into lysosomes depends on the acidic pH of these compartments, ion-trapping weak bases [13]. In this model, the most suitable weak bases are those with a pKa around 8.",

Previous studies of Chloroquine and NH4Cl have demonstrated that it has multiple effects on mammalian cells in addition to the elevation of endosomal pH, including the prevention of terminal glycosylation of immunoglobulin's [24]. When added to virus-infected cells, chloroquine inhibited later stages in vesicular stomatitis virus maturation by inhibiting the glycoprotein expression at the cell surface [25], and it inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 particles by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the glycoprotein [26,27]. Increase in pH by Chloroquine and NH4Cl, firstly inhibits low pH confirmational changes that triggers fusion, penetration and uncoating and secondly inhibits posttranslational modification of HCV enveloped proteins (E1 and E2) (Figure 4). Our results demonstrated that, Chloroquine and NH4Cl inhibit HCVpp entry in a dose-dependent manner at non toxic concentration. Chloroquine and NH4Cl resulted in greater than 50% reduction of virus infectivity at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM and 10 mM respectively, suggesting a pH-sensitive route of virus entry (Figure 2a and 2b).",
