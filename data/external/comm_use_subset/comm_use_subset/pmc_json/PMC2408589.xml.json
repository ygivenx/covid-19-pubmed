            "text": "Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA) is the causative agent of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease affecting more than 12 million people worldwide each year [1]. After a period of decline in the 1990s, the number of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis has been raising annually since 2000 in the United States [2]. Sequencing of the 1.14 Mbp genome of the Nichols strain of TPA in 1998 [3] greatly stimulated study of this unculturable pathogen. One important direction not yet developed is use of the Nichols sequence for comparative studies to determine variation between different syphilis isolates, how representative Nichols is of TPA, and the genetic differences between closely related treponemes causing different diseases (e.g. syphilis, yaws, bejel, pinta). To sample strains on a sufficient scale, rapid, inexpensive, and highly accurate sequencing methods are needed. Traditional whole genome shotgun sequencing methods using dideoxy-terminators (WGS-DDT) are relatively slow and costly to be applied to numerous samples. Here we sequence a treponemal genome by Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) [4], which provides an alternative to WGS-DDT sequencing of closely related genomes. CGS was previously used for mutation discovery in viruses [5], in mutagenized laboratory bacterial and fungal strains [4,6-9], in clinical isolates of bacteria [10,11], and for whole genome scale comparative studies [12-14].",

In vitro testing of SS14 revealed it to be less susceptible to a variety of antibiotics when compared to Nichols [16]. Nichols strain was isolated in 1912 in Washington, D.C. from cerebrospinal fluid of the patient with neurosyphilis [17]. Previous studies (D. \u0160majs, G. M. Weinstock, unpublished results) showed SS14 had all genes of the Nichols genome as judged by hybridization to a microarray containing PCR products of all annotated Nichols open reading frames (ORFs) [18]. To compare these closely related, yet phenotypically distinct strains, we sequenced the SS14 genome by CGS.",

Regions giving significantly weaker SS14 signals indicated 1731 candidate regions of variation encompassing 1 or more overlapping oligonucleotide targets. The sequencing data identified 213 SNPs in the SS14 genome. An additional 17 questionable SNPs were suggested in repeated sequences of the genome but did not score well in a SNP uniqueness algorithm [4], and thus could represent false positives due to cross hybridization with the other repeats. DDT sequencing of 12 such regions revealed 5 real SNPs, 6 false positives, and one position with 2 alleles within the SS14 population (intrastrain heterogeneity). Therefore these questionable SNPs were not included in the final sequence, unless they were verified by DDT sequencing (data not shown). An additional 62 positions out of the 213 SNPs identified by CGS were DDT sequenced. 60 SNPs were confirmed (Tables 1, 2, 3 last column) and 2 false positives were found.",

These represented possible hypervariable regions with multiple differences from Nichols in the sequencing 29 mers. DNA regions comprising these sites were grouped into 38 larger regions (29\u20131507 bp), amplified by PCR and DDT sequenced. In 21 of the 38 cases, mostly closely spaced SNPs and/or short insertions or deletions (indels ranging from 1 to 7 nts) were found while no changes were seen in 17 cases (Table 1, column 7), which is in agreement with data obtained by others [12]. DDT sequencing of hypervariable regions suggested by the first phase of CGS identified nucleotide changes in these regions (Table 1, column 7) and also in the vicinity of these regions, where results of the first CGS phase suggested no changes (Table 1, column 8), indicating the need for extension of DDT sequenced regions of at least 100 bp in both directions. Additional short indels were discovered during DDT sequencing of regions identified by WGF (Table 3). Altogether, 2 false positive SNPs (data not shown), 19 false negative SNPs and an additional 16 indels (Tables 1, 3) were found in these DDT sequenced regions (42,344 bp). The overall confirmation of data suggests that repeated regions of the genome are limitations for SNP discovery and almost half of possible hypervariable regions are false positive results.",

The experiments agreed at 192 SNPs (97%), and 12 SNPs were predicted by only one CGS experiment. Out of these 12 SNPs, 7 were found to be real, as shown by DDT sequencing (data not shown), three loci showed intrastrain heterogeneity in one of the two SS14 DNA isolations, with one allele identical to the Nichols genome sequence and a second allele identical to the base change found by CGS. Two SNPs were predicted falsely, and in both cases the false SNP was located next to a real SNP.

This physical mapping approach showed the order of the ORFs along the chromosome is identical to Nichols genome and 4 large indel regions were identified. A 64 bp deletion upstream of TP0136 was found by both CGS and WGF methods. Three additional indels were found only by WGF, two insertions (between genes TP0126\u2013TP0127 and within overlapping genes TP0433\u2013TP0434) and one deletion (in TP0470) (Table 3). A deletion in TP0470 and an insertion in TP0433\u2013TP0434 comprised tandem repeats of 24 and 60 bp, respectively. Similar analysis of the Nichols strain revealed length differences in genes TP0433\u2013TP0434 compared to the published sequence [GenBank:AE000520] as described previously [19]. Moreover, intrastrain heterogeneity in the Nichols strain was observed in regions comprising TP0126\u2013TP0127 and upstream of TP0136 with one allele identical to the published sequence. In the Nichols BAC library [20], similar intrastrain heterogeneity was found in the vicinity of gene TP0126. This region comprises a 1255 bp insertion between genes TP0126 and TP0127 in SS14 strain. A similar region was previously described in another syphilitic strain (Chicago, [GenBank:AY587909]) and was found to contain a sequence similar to tprK and is believed to be recipient site of the tprK conversion [21]. Altogether, three large indels were not detected by CGS. We suggest probable reasons for this fact are (1) the length of the repeats is similar to/longer than oligonucleotides used on the array and (2) sequence changes were found in Nichols DNA when compared to published complete sequence used for mapping array design [GenBank:AE000520].",

Because the CGS strategy uses genomic DNA as a probe, accuracy is affected by the presence of repeated sequences. Repeat regions hybridize to more than one oligonucleotide on a tiling array resulting in both reduced sensitivity to detect changes, as well as ambiguity in assigning locations for the variants detected. Precautions have to be taken when inspecting tpr regions and others (arp gene, TP0470) which cross-react based on sequence similarity. Such regions, together with highly variable regions, need to be analyzed by WGF and sequenced by DDT to reveal true nucleotide changes and numbers of repeated regions. Another possible restriction of this methodology arises from the character of the TPA population. Multiple sequence variants in the Nichols strain population were both described previously and identified in this work, and hybridization based sequence changes discovery in these regions is influenced by the ratio between/among different sequence variants in the population. Finally, the accuracy of the genome sequence produced by CGS is dependent on the accuracy of the reference genome sequence. As suggested by two newly revealed frameshifts in Nichols strain sequence, discovered sequence changes have to be verified in Nichols sequence to describe real sequence changes compared to Nichols genome.",

Both Nichols and SS14 cause infection in rabbits and so are not believed to be attenuated to cause infection in man, thus it is very probable none of the differences may affect the ability of the bacteria to cause the disease. The examples of interstrain heterogeneity and multiple alleles in a population of haploid organisms are candidates for antigenic variation, contingency genes and other types of SSR (short sequence repeats) [30,31]. Changes resulting in significant differences in protein sequences (frameshifts and sequence changes causing protein length shifts) and hypervariable regions affected novel genes, membrane antigens and Tpr proteins. The Tpr protein family includes 12 Treponema pallidum repeat proteins, found uniquely in this bacterium and showing sequence similarity to major sheath protein of Treponema denticola. 8 out of 12 tpr genes (66%) were found to be affected by sequence changes representing a higher proportion than the whole genome rate (13.1%). Positions showing interstrain and intrastrain heterogeneity or both were found in tpr genes. Altogether 53 SNPs and 38 intrastrain variable nucleotide positions, with at least one allele identical to the sequence of the Nichols genome, were found in tpr genes (V1\u2013V7 regions of tprK were excluded from this analysis). Based on the fact that tpr genes share a high degree of similarity on the DNA level, we expect differences could be underestimated due to the limitations of the hybridization method for repeated sequences. Multiple alleles of tpr genes were described among and within TPA strains [22-24,32,33] and some TPA repeated regions (tpr genes, arp gene) were used as loci for typing of clinical isolates [34-38]. Newly identified hypervariable regions (Table 5) represent candidate sequences to screen clinical isolates and have potential to be used as typing markers of strains and isolates. In addition, different strains of TPA have already been tested for association with higher risk for neuroinvasion in rabbits [39] and identification of underlying sequence changes will enable prediction of such risks. The identified variation in novel genes suggests other targets besides tpr genes could be responsible for antigenic variation in TPA, or without support of further expression and antigenicity data, these could represent pseudogenes.",

We expect this method to be combined with new sequencing technologies to produce high quality genome sequences to provide important data to design genotyping systems for more intensive strain sampling. Sequence variants could be readily used for molecular typing and identification of SS14 and Nichols strains and, with accumulation of additional data from other TPA genomes, for epidemiologic applications and clinical discrimination between reinfection and reactivation of syphilitic processes. Moreover, the ability to now sequence numerous TPA strains, especially those showing different degrees of virulence, will allow phenotype to be correlated with sequence. This is a significant development for an organism of important public health impact, but for which standard bacterial genetic methods are untenable.",
