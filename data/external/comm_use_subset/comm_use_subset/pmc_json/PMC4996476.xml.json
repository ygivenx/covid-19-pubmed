Disaster Information Specialists should become increasingly proactive in assisting disaster/emergency personnel through education/training and knowledge management. Suggested routes for promotion include attending conferences and publishing articles and editorials about the Disaster Information Specialist concept in both library journals and journals that reach an emergency/disaster workforce audience. Areas to explore are marketing the Specialist concept to public health departments and policymakers, and suggesting that librarians support Emergency Operations Centers; assisting public health departments and emergency shelters with information for responders, shelter operators, and the public; collaborating with local health and hospital hotlines during a crisis; and working with poison control centers and local disaster voluntary organizations.",

Following an incident, DIMRC provides timely, authoritative health information for use in affected communities; encourages local librarian participation in response efforts; and exploits teachable moments to further prepare librarians in unaffected regions. DIMRC especially focuses on unfamiliar topics and rare occurrences such as massive oil spills, radiation incidents, or incidents that cause illness or injuries not encountered in routine medical practice. The NN/LM Regional Medical Libraries are invaluable partners in disseminating information about disaster health issues when a disaster strikes in their regions. They also reach out to librarians affected by a disaster and to libraries experiencing major service disruptions.",

Depending on the incident, DIMRC response may include wide dissemination of health information to responders and librarians through Twitter, the DISASTR-OUTREACH-LIB list-serv, webinars, and Web guides or topic pages pointing to incident-specific online resources. A hands-on approach was taken by a senior computer scientist from DIMRC asked by PAHO to help create a local emergency operations center in Port-au-Prince and organize information about the activities of the nearly 100 agencies providing health care in Haiti during the cholera epidemic. DIMRC coordinates with other federal agencies to provide government-wide consistent, authoritative health information relevant to each incident. Announcements of activation of the Emergency Access Initiative (for free access to books, journals, and databases) are widely distributed. DIMRC staff monitor public news sources and HHS Secretary\u2019s Operations Center reports and response activities to maintain awareness of public health issues stemming from an incident.",
