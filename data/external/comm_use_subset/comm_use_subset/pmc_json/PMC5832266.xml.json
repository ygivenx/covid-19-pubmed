The prototypic early European strain of PEDV was first characterized from infected pigs in 1978 and was named CV777 [1]. The virus is now classified as a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus within the family Coronaviridae. The CV777 strain has been propagated both in pigs and in Vero cell cultures. Like other coronaviruses, the virus particles have a characteristic \u201ccorona-like\u201d morphology due to the presence of the surface exposed spike (S) protein. These viruses are enveloped and contain a positive sense RNA genome that is about 28,000 nucleotides (nt) in length; the complete genome sequence of the CV777 strain has been assembled [2] (Accession no. AF353511).",

During the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, the disease spread within Europe and also in Asia where it has caused significant problems (reviewed in [3, 4, 5]). After this time, the disease declined within Europe and very few cases have been recorded there until recently. However, a new wave of PEDV infections occurred from 2010 onwards in China and adjacent countries [6] and the disease spread, for the first time, into the USA in 2013 [7]. Indeed, it appears that there have been two separate introductions of distinct PEDV strains into the USA [7, 8]. These viruses differ significantly within the sequence of the S gene (encoding the spike protein); these distinct strains have been classified as being within different genogroups (1b and 2b) based on the sequence of the S gene alone. These two strains of PEDV are also referred to as \u201cINDEL\u201d and \u201cnon-INDEL\u201d respectively, reflecting the presence or absence of insertions and deletions within the S gene sequence (prototypic strains are: USA/OH851/2014, GenBank accession no. KJ399978, [9] and USA/Kansas29/2013, GenBank accession no. KJ645637.1, [10] respectively). However, neither form of nomenclature is entirely satisfactory. Indeed, both of these US variants of PEDV have been classified as being within genotype 2, based on complete genome sequences [5], while the early European strains, e.g. CV777, are in genotype 1.",

The resultant sequences have now been compared. Not surprisingly, each of the sequences obtained is different although closely related. The use of NGS on RNA isolated from infected cells also allowed evaluation of the sequences and relative levels of the various sub-genomic viral mRNAs.

There is also a 3 nt deletion (nt 25201\u201325203) in the residual ORF3 coding sequence within the FLI strain which would make for an in-frame deletion but since the initiation codon is lost then this is probably not significant. Interestingly the APHA sequence lacks just 2 nt (nt 25202\u201325203) at this point (Fig 3). The presence of this 2 nt deletion has been confirmed using Sanger sequencing of a conventional RT-PCR amplicon including this region. The deletion results in the production of a new, in-frame, stop codon and hence premature termination of the ORF3 protein (Fig 3). It is predicted that the truncated ORF3 product is 137 aa in length, compared to 224 aa for the reference sequence.

This indicates that the 5\u00b4-terminal sequence of the Br1/87 RNA contains a modified leader sequence that spans from nt 11 and into stem loop 4 (SL4, see [21]), of the reference sequence (Fig 6). The presence of this extensive self-complementary sequences means than a large stem-loop structure can be formed at the 5\u00b4-terminus of the genomic RNA (see Fig 5(C)). Interestingly, within the minority of reads that correspond to the reference CV777 sequence there is a single nt change (A to G) corresponding to nt position 8 in the reference sequence that matches one of the two changes observed in the APHA and ANSES CV777 sequences (see above). Thus, it seems that there is heterogeneity within the Br1/87 virus population and that the majority of genomes and the sub-genomic mRNAs produced within infected cells have a rearranged 5'-UTR compared to the consensus CV777 genome. Clearly, the presence of the \u201creverse complement\u201d sequence indicates that the modified sequence is not just random rearrangement. Furthermore, interestingly, it is possible to derive a secondary structure model for the 5'-terminal stem loop structure of the Br1/87 sequence (SL1, see [21]) that appears similar to that predicted for the CV777 sequence and could be an alternative for the usual SL1 structure (see Fig 5A and 5B). In particular, the stem regions are completely conserved even though the upper stem in the Br1/87 sequence is the \u201creverse complement\u201d of the CV777 SL1 sequence. However, the terminal loop sequence of the predicted SL1 is completely different, (CUACGG in CV777 and CCGUAG in Br1/87).",

From the consensus sequence derived from the NGS data, it appears that some rearrangement of these terminal sequences has occurred in most of the genomes. This does not appear to be a simple artefact since the derived sequence includes the \u201creverse complement\u201d of a part of the reference virus sequence. It is possible to predict an alternative, but closely related SL1 structure for the Br1/87 sequence that maintains the sequence of the two stems of the CV777 SL1 (c.f. Fig 5(A) and 5(B)) but has a distinct apical loop. Recent studies have revealed conservation of this SL1 loop structure and an essential role in virus replication [21, 24]. Additional support for this rearranged sequence was derived from the sequence of reads corresponding to sub-genomic mRNAs (see Fig 6). It is currently unclear what effect the presence of the rearranged 5\u00b4-terminal sequence in the Br1/87 genomic RNA and sub-genomic mRNAs will have on the function of these transcripts. It can be envisaged that the presence of a stable hairpin structure at the 5'-termini of these RNAs would be strongly inhibitory to cap-dependent translation initiation (see [25, 26]) and thus the production of viral proteins can be expected to be low. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the proportion of sub-genomic mRNA reads containing the rearranged leader fused to the S protein coding region is unexpectedly high (see S4 Table). This is not the case for the reads corresponding to the sub-genomic mRNAs including the CV777 5\u00b4-terminal sequence, which is consistent with previous data (e.g. see [27]). This requires further study but it may suggest that the modified leader becomes part of the transcript that encodes the S protein with a higher efficiency than to the other sub-genomic mRNA sequences. Thus, the ratio of viral proteins produced could also be affected.",

An intestinal loop was inserted into the piglets and the intestinal contents were collected and then stored at -80\u00b0C. This strain was not amplified in cultured cells. The viral stock stored at -80\u00b0C since 1982 has been inoculated recently by the oral route into SPF piglets at 3 weeks of age (108 genome copies/pig). The experiment was carried out in the air-filtered level 3 biosecurity facilities of ANSES in accordance with the European and French regulations on animal welfare. The protocol for this experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee registered under number #16 by the French Ministry of Research (No.03596.03). Two piglets were euthanized at 4 days post-inoculation and showed macroscopic lesions typical of PED and PEDV genome was detected in affected tissues.",

The virus was grown in Vero cells (see [5]) using serum-free medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin [37]. The medium was harvested when 50% of the cells displayed CPE (4 days post infection), centrifuged at 4000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris and concentrated 30-fold using a 30K Amicon Ultracel centrifugal filter (Amicon, Fisher Scientific, Landsmeer, The Netherlands). From this concentrated fraction, RNA was isolated using Trizol LS (Invitrogen). After DNase I digestion, a cDNA library for MiSeq sequencing was prepared as described [38]. Briefly, 1st strand and 2nd strand cDNA was synthesized using a degenerate primer with a sequence tag (GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-N9) and linearly amplified by PCR using the tag primer GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA (annealing to 5' terminal sequence of the 2nd strand cDNA). Fragments under 200 bp in length were removed and the integrity and size distribution of the cDNA library was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and shown to meet the quality criteria for MiSeq sequencing recommended by Illumina.
