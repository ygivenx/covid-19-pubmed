A subgroup of immunity-related IFITMs (IFITM1-3) has been recognized recently to inhibit multiplication of a broad range of viruses including, but not limited to, influenza A viruses (FLUAV), flaviviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses and lentiviruses [4\u201311]. IFITM proteins are type II transmembrane proteins and consist of a variable cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by a conserved intramembrane domain, an intracellular loop, a transmembrane domain and a short variable and luminal C-terminus [12\u201314]. It is well established that IFITMs inhibit viral entry [11]. While the exact mechanism still has to be elucidated, IFITMs seem to act through the arrest of virus-host cell membrane fusion at the hemifusion step by altering membrane fluidity [15, 16]. Despite their broad antiviral activity, IFITMs can also promote entry or assembly of selected viruses [17, 18], indicating that they belong to a pathway that can positively and negatively regulate viral infection.",

In addition, IFITMs may target later stages of the viral replication cycle such as Gag expression and proteolytic processing of Env [8, 21, 22]. The antiviral activity of IFITM1 can restrict HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread, and mutations in env and vpu have been identified that rescue the virus from inhibition by IFITM1 at the cost of reduced viral fitness [21, 23]. Moreover, IFITMs are incorporated into lentiviral particles thereby reducing viral infectivity even though inhibition by IFITMs and virion incorporation of IFITMs were not found to be intimately related [21, 24, 25]. Finally, unlike other antiviral effector proteins of innate immunity, IFITMs do not seem to be antagonized by viral factors [22].",

            "text": "Different lines of evidence suggest that IFITMs can limit viral spread and reduce disease burden in the infected host. Thus, absence of IFITM3 expression was found to be associated with reduced FLUAV spread and pathogenesis in experimentally inoculated mice [26, 27]. Moreover, a polymorphism in the human IFITM3 gene (rs12252 T>C) was found in several studies to be associated with severe influenza [16, 27\u201329], although one study reported an association with mild influenza only [30]. The rs12252 T>C polymorphism is believed to alter IFITM3 mRNA splicing [27] and to result in the expression of an IFITM3 variant lacking the first 21 amino acids, which displays reduced antiviral activity against FLUAV upon directed expression in cell culture [31]. Conversely, the truncated protein exerts increased anti-HIV-1 activity in transfected cells, due to preferential localization at the cell surface [32], the site of HIV-1 entry and exit from target cells. However, an association between rs12252-C and more rapid progression to AIDS, but not risk of HIV-1 infection, has been demonstrated [33], and the reason for the discrepancy between these results and the increased anti-HIV-1 activity of truncated IFITM3 in cell culture is at present unclear. Finally, a recent study demonstrated that HIV-1 variants sexually transmitted between individuals are resistant against blockade by IFITM proteins indicative of a strong selection pressure exerted by IFITMs [34, 35]. Moreover, IFITM expression was shown to be a major contributor to the blockade of HIV-1 by treatment of cells with IFN [34], suggesting that IFITMs constitute important defenses against HIV-1 infection.",

Some primate IFITM gene products were recently shown to have antiviral activity against SIV and HIV-1 [19, 20]. However, these analyses did not include rhesus macaque so that it is presently unknown whether rhesus macaque (rh) IFITM3 also inhibits SIV infection in this species. Moreover, no rhIFITM3 gene polymorphisms have been described so far or their modulatory effect upon infection by SIV or other viruses studied. Therefore, we systematically searched for polymorphisms in rhIFITM3 and assessed their association with viral load at set point and disease progression in the context of SIV infection.",

During quarantine, the animals were usually housed in groups of 2\u20133 animals per cage, with a minimum enclosure height of 180 cm and a cage volume of 3 to 4.5 m3. Animals in experiments had to be housed singly (cage dimensions [in cm]: 190h \u00d7 90w \u00d7 90d), but with constant visual, olfactory and acoustic contact to their roommates. Procedures for animal welfare and to minimize discomfort and suffering were undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report \u201cThe use of nonhuman primates in research\u201d. Monkeys were fed with dry monkey biscuits supplemented with fresh fruit or vegetables twice daily and fresh water access ad libitum. For environmental enrichment, animals were offered feeding puzzles, varying toys and wood sticks for gnawing. In addition, music was played. For DNA preparation, blood samples were drawn under anesthesia with 10 mg ketamine i.m. per kg body weight. Animals were humanely euthanized by an overdose of Pentobarbital-Natrium (Narcoren\u00ae, Merial, Hallbergmoos, Germany) under anesthesia either for experimental reasons without exhibiting clinical symptoms or in cases of suffering predefined by a scoring system of termination criteria that was approved by the external ethics committee and corresponds to the IACUC endpoint guidelines as described [40].

Here, we investigated whether rhIFITM3 inhibits viral entry in a way similar to human (hu) IFITM3, employing a pseudo-typing approach. Expression of huIFITM3 in 293T cells did not appreciably inhibit entry driven by the MLV envelope protein (Env) or the Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC) whereas entry driven by the FLUAV-hemagglutinin (HA) was robustly inhibited (Fig 1), in keeping with published findings [4\u20136]. Entry driven by SIV-Env was also reduced upon huIFITM3 expression (Fig 1), again in agreement with published data [19, 20]. A similar tendency was observed for rhIFITM3 even though inhibition of SIV-Env- and FLUAV-HA-driven entry was less robust than in the case of huIFITM3 (Fig 1), despite comparable expression levels [6]. Thus, rhIFITM3 exerts antiviral activity but does so less efficiently than huIFITM3.",

To obtain results from a larger collection of animals, we randomly selected additional 55 animals for inclusion into a second cohort (cohort 2) (Table 1). The rhIFITM3 gene has two exons leading to a mature mRNA of 636 bp (XM_001085567.2) whereas the genomic region encoding the primary transcript comprises 1202 bp. We devised a PCR strategy to selectively amplify the genomic region of the rhIFITM3 gene so as to yield a 1340 bp amplification product (Fig 2). The DNA sequence was determined directly from purified PCR products, and sequence variations were identified at 16 positions (Fig 3 and Table 2). Three polymorphisms were located in the coding region but did not change the amino acid sequence. Twelve polymorphisms (including one single nucleotide deletion) were intronic and one polymorphism was located upstream of the coding sequence. Seven polymorphisms had a low level of heterozygosity (\u226410%) but, with few exceptions, the two cohorts were found to be characterized by similar major allele frequencies (MAF; Table 2). Polymorphism g.488 C>A was only detected in the second cohort. Polymorphisms g.279 G>A and g.678 G>T showed higher heterozygosity in cohort 2, while the opposite was true for g.693 delA, g.708 A>G, g.709 G>A and g.747 T>G. Finally, a polymorphism in the 5\u00b4region of the coding sequence that corresponds to rs12252 T>C in the human IFITM3 gene was not identified in our sample.",

We demonstrated that rhIFITM3 displays antiviral activity and identified 16 polymorphisms in rhIFITM3. Some of the polymorphisms were associated with either disease progression or viral load.

However, IFITM proteins from rhesus macaques were not included in these studies. Our results demonstrate that rhIFITM3 and huIFITM3 target the same viral glycoproteins, but with somewhat different efficiency. Thus, entry driven by FLUAV-HA and SIV-Env appears to be more efficiently inhibited by huIFITM3 than by rhIFITM3. These results are in agreement with our previous analysis demonstrating that huIFITM3 inhibits entry driven by filovirus glycoproteins with greater efficiency than rhIFITM3, despite comparable expression in cells [6]. In summary, rhIFITM3 inhibits entry of SIV in cell culture which raised the question whether rhIFITM3 is polymorphic and whether possible polymorphisms would impact the course of SIV infection.",

Three of the polymorphisms identified in our study were located within the coding sequences, but led to silent changes. This is noteworthy since the N-terminal residues of IFITM3 control intracellular localization and spectrum of antiviral activity [32, 43, 44] and were suggested to be shaped by selective pressure during primate evolution [32]. One polymorphism was located upstream of the coding sequence; all other polymorphisms were identified within the intron. We found no evidence for a polymorphism that would lead to the production of a truncated protein similar to rs12252-C in human IFITM3, a variant that is associated with the clinical severity of influenza disease [27]. Our results were in keeping with a previous report suggesting that IFITM1 and IFITM3 in non-human primates probably underwent purifying selection [20]. Thus, we did not find any non-synonymous polymorphisms, indicating that maintenance of the primary amino acid sequence is essential for the function of the protein in rhesus macaques.",

For this, we used a sample that previously allowed detection of an association between TLR7 polymorphisms and survival time (cohort 1, [39]) and a sample of randomly selected animals (cohort 2). When the full set of animals was considered, we identified three polymorphisms (g.270 C>T, g.279 G>A, g.678 G>T) with a nominally significant association between a genotype and AIDS-free survival, but not with virus load at set point (20 weeks post infection). However, for two of these polymorphisms the association was not significant if the two cohorts were analyzed separately or when animals with MHC allele Mamu-A1*001 were excluded from the analysis. The polymorphism g.279 G>A genotype AA showed a nominally significant association with AIDS progression even after adjustment for MHC alleles. However, this position is only modestly polymorphic and the association observed was dependent on a single animal with AA genotype.
