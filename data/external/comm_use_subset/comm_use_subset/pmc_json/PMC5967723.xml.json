An International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report listed 833 species extinctions over the past 500 years and attributed only 3.7% of these to infectious disease [1]. This low percentage of extinctions caused by infectious disease may be partly due to the past use of less sophisticated diagnostic techniques to detect infectious agents, as it is now becoming apparent that the effects of urbanization, human population growth, altered land use, deforestation, reduced biodiversity and global trade are leading to an increase in infectious disease incidence and impact [2]. These same factors are also increasing the frequency of disease transmission between humans, domestic animals and wildlife [2, 3] resulting in a dramatic rise in both emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses [4].",

Other infectious agents have also impacted bat populations. Of particular note is an event involving the mass mortality of thousands of bent-winged bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in France, Spain and Portugal in 2002 [7]. This was thought to have been caused by infection with a novel filovirus, termed Lloviu virus [8], which was only found in dead bats. A betaherpesvirus was also found in the same affected bats. Its significance in the mortality event was unclear, however herpesviruses have been found asymptomatically in a number of different bat species, in addition to bent-winged bats [9\u201314].",

In south-eastern Australia there are two subspecies of large bent-winged bat (M. orianae) that form separate maternity colonies [16]. The southern bent-winged bat (M. orianae bassanii) occurs only in south-western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia (SA). There are two maternity caves, one near Warrnambool (38.3687\u00b0 S, 142.4982\u00b0 E) in Victoria and the other near Naracoorte (36.9602\u00b0 S, 140.7413\u00b0 E) in SA. In the last 50 years the size of the Naracoorte population of southern bent-winged bats has declined from an estimated 200,000 in the 1950s to 20,000 in 2009 [17]. The Warrnambool population declined from 15,000 to 10,000 over the same time period [17]. The subspecies was listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2007. The eastern bent-winged bat (M. orianae oceanensis) is more common and widespread, being distributed along the east coast of Australia [15]. Although numbers appear to be stable, the subspecies is listed as vulnerable in Victoria due to the use of just a single maternity site [17].",

Individual sequences were assigned to groups of identical, or near identical (like) sequences. Near identical sequences were examined for stop codons and multiple peaks. They contained a maximum of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the approximately 200 bp of the sequenced product (2%). Consensus sequences were generated from groups of like sequences and then compared to published protein sequences in the GenBank database [43] with the highest percentage identity using the BLAST-X algorithm [44]. The resulting predicted amino acid pairwise identities were recorded. A portion of the predicted amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase region from the detected herpesviruses were aligned with representative members from the three Herpesviridae subfamilies from a range of host species using MAFFT v7.308 [45], in conjunction with the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix [46]. The sequences selected for inclusion in this alignment included sequences with a high level of identity to the viruses sequenced in this study, other viruses detected in different bat species, and additional viruses that were selected to ensure that the different Herpesviridae subfamilies were represented in the analysis. A phylogenetic tree was generated from the 45 amino acid long alignment using MrBayes v3.2.6 [47] with four heated chains, a chain length of 1,000,000, sampling every 10,000 iterations, and a burn in of 10%. Amino acid sequence is most commonly used when comparing between herpesvirus sub-families as it is typically more informative than relying on overly-divergent nucleotide sequences, which will affect the quality of the alignment and therefore the quality of the tree [48]. Model selection was undertaken using ModelGenerator v0.85 [49], and the Le and Gascuel model [50], with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites (LG+I+G), was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion [51]. A phylogenetic tree was similarly generated using 136 nucleotide sequences, for comparison.",

Analysis of the herpesvirus sequence data from these 89 samples revealed six different consensus viral sequences or sequence types (S1 Table), including one gammaherpesvirus (referred to as N7050-like viruses) and five betaherpesviruses (referred to as D15, NG46, CH20, E22 and CH6-like viruses). The viral sequences were compared with bat herpesviruses in GenBank and the maximum percentage predicted amino acid identity to other known bat herpesviruses was found to range from 61% (for CH20-like viruses) to 96% (for CH6-like viruses) (Table 2). This region of the genome is highly conserved in gammaherpesviruses (e.g. 93% amino acid pairwise identity between the closely related equine gammaherpesviruses 5 and 7, GenBank accession numbers AF141886.1 and AKE07652.1, respectively) and betaherpesviruses (e.g. 98% amino acid pairwise identity between the closely related human betaherpesviruses 6A and 6B, GenBank accession numbers APO39176.1 and AB283024.1, respectively), suggesting that the detected viruses may be novel viruses, although further genome sequencing is required to confirm this. A phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship of the six virus sequence types with each other and with other known herpesviruses is presented in Fig 1. A similarity matrix of aligned amino acid sequences and a nucleotide phylogenetic tree are available as supplementary information (S2 Table and S1 Fig). This analysis, despite the small fragment of protein sequence available for assessment and low posterior support values for some internal branches, highlighted that the detected viruses clustered within the Herpesviridae subfamilies, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaherpesvirinae.",

The small amount of blood that was collected in this study (a maximum of 90 \u03bcL per bat) was prioritised for haematological and biochemical testing (as a component of a related study) rather than for virological screening. The use of oral swab samples combined with molecular methods to screen for shedding of viruses has been successfully used in bats for European bat lyssavirus, a virus closely related to ABLV, detecting virus in 15 of 71 samples [53] and consistent with lyssaviruses being shed in the saliva of infected animals [54]. While the present study also used this method to screen for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses and henipaviruses, which can all be found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, testing faeces, urine or blood may have increased the chances of finding these viruses [8, 19, 22, 26, 55].",

Two herpesviruses (CH6-like and E22-like) were detected only in eastern bent-winged bats, whilst another herpesvirus (N7050-like) was detected only in southern bent-winged bats, raising the possibility that these viruses are specific for each of the sub-species of bent-winged bats, although this requires further investigation with larger numbers of animals and samples collected over different times of the year. Three herpesviruses were detected across both bat subspecies, including D15-like herpesvirus, which was found at all seven locations. Herpesviruses have a low rate of nucleotide substitution and have co-evolved with their hosts over many millions of years [56], thus, even in the presence of relatively limited movement of bats between the locations included in the present study, it is expected that the same or similar viruses would occur due to some herpesviruses being present before sub-speciation of the bats, or before bat populations became relatively isolated from each other.",

As temperatures within the caves occupied by the bats are below 25\u00b0C year round [61] and bats go into torpor over winter, lowering their body temperatures to within a few degrees of ambient [62], this would create unfavourable conditions for virus growth and replication.

Ideally, ill or recently dead bats would be surveyed as they may contain infectious agents not found in healthy bats, as demonstrated by the European filovirus outbreak [8]. Unfortunately, dead and dying bats are rapidly removed from caves by rats, foxes and other scavengers and rarely found in a state that allows for disease investigation. Based on these results, and the absence of disease or any obvious lesions attributable to herpesvirus infection in any of the bats sampled, it seems likely that the detected herpesviruses are well adapted to their hosts and that bent-winged bats usually carry these herpesviruses with no apparent ill effects.",

As southern bent-winged bat numbers have recently declined, it could be assumed that this population is labouring under some form of stress, which may be absent from the eastern bent-winged bat population, which would result in a greater number of herpesvirus positive southern bent-winged bats. While Victorian southern bent-winged bats did have a higher prevalence of infection than eastern bent-winged bats, the opposite was true for the South Australian bats. Similarly, presumably due to an immature immune system [65], more juveniles than adults tend to excrete herpesviruses [52]. This was observed in bats from Naracoorte (southern bent-winged bat), but not those from Lakes Entrance (eastern bent-winged bat).",

No clinical effects could be attributed to these infections. However, it may be worthwhile conducting further surveys, encompassing a broader range of viruses, because European bent-winged bats (M. schreibersii) were found to harbour rotaviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses and bufaviruses [66\u201369], while other bat species have tested positive for papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, retroviruses and poxviruses [55, 70].",
