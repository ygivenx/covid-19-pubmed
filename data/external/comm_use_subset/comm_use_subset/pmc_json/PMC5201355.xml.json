The survey was administered on paper in either Arabic or English according to respondent preference. The responses entered into an electronic database for analysis. The content areas included MERS coronavirus knowledge and sources of information; personal experiences with MERS-CoV; opinions about the location of management of patients with emerging infectious diseases; attitudes of the HCWs to infection control practices; the educational needs of the HCWs about emerging infectious diseases; and self-reported infection control practices of the HCWs. All responses were anonymous. A Chi Square test was used to compare differences in the proportions of categorical variables. Significance was determined at the 0.05 threshold. ",

System level improvements, such as incorporation of emerging infectious diseases into medical schools and continuous medical education programs, the implementation of isolation and infection control measures, and appropriate nursing-to-patient ratios would also improve preparedness [12].
