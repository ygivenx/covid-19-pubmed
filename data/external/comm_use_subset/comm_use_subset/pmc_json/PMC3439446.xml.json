More recently, three more genotypes of HBoV (HBoV2\u20134) were found, [2], [20], [21], and reports have shown that inter-genotype and intra-genotype recombinations are present among bocavirus [22]. All 4 genotypes of HBoV have been identified in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), whereas only HBoV1 and HBoV2 were reported in respiratory tract samples. Due to the higher rates of co-infections with other pathogens, it remains to be clarified whether in these diseases HBoVs are the key etiologic agent or just a concomitant virus bystander.",

Geographically, the city is characteristics of a tropical-subtropical climate, with the average annual temperature of 20\u201322\u00b0C and average relative humidity of 77%. The city is also highly populated, with a resident population of 12.70 million, plus a non-residential population of 4.76 million. These socio-natural factors make the region generally vulnerable to air-borne as well as food-borne viral infection. The epidemiological status and genomic characteristics of HBoV prevailing in pediatric and adult patients with respiratory infection in the region, however, remains unknown. In our current study, we screened throat swab specimens from patients with acute respiratory tract infection symptoms for HBoV and other common respiratory viruses over a 12-month period using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, and in addition, the molecular phylogeny and complete genome sequences of 2 HBoV strains were also analyzed.",

HBoV strains used in the phylogenetic analysis included the strains obtained in this study in Guangzhou (GZ4785 and GZ9081), representative strains of HBoV1-4, human parvovirus B19, bovine, and canine minute virus. Based on complete genome, the phylogenetic analysis results showed that the two Guangzhou strains GZ4785 and GZ9081 were genetically close to HBoV1 (Fig. 3), consistent with the sequence comparison analysis results. From the phylogenetic tree based on complete genome, different strains of HBoV1 were clearly divided into three groups (Fig. 4A), and the representative strain of group I and group II was the prototype strains ST1 and ST2, respectively. Group III included 4 strains which came from Taiwan, Thailand, and Guangzhou. Most Chinese strains obtained from respiratory specimens belonged to group I, but it is noteworthy that GZ9081 strain obtained in this study belonged to group III. No apparently genotypic differences existed between the phylogenetic trees based on the 3 HBoV ORFs (NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2) and the complete genome of 23 HBoV1 strains (Fig. 4B\u2013D). Similar to previous studies [2], [24], NS1 appeared to be the most conserved gene, whereas VP1/VP2 had the most nucleotide polymorphisms.

Therefore, RDP was further carried out.

The pathogenicity of HBoV is still in uncertain because of its high co-infection rate with other pathogens, and it remains unclear whether HBoVs are sole etiologic agent or just a concomitant virus bystander. Therefore, to understand the prevailing status and pathogenicity of HBoV, other pathogens needed to be simultaneously examined. So in this study, a surveillance of 12 months period during 2010\u20132011 in Guangzhou was established to understand the prevalence and pathogenicity of HBoV in patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Other 6 common respiratory viruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, RSV, metapneumovirus) were screened at the same time to understand their co-infection status with HBoV. The results revealed that the overall monthly distribution of HBoV and other 6 common respiratory viruses were typical, in accordance with the epidemics of respiratory viruses in tropical/subtropical areas like Guangzhou, which demonstrated that the surveillance data in this study were highly reliable. It is notable that HBoV, like RSV, tended to mainly infect \u22642 year old infants, with only a few adult infections, and the majority of the HBoV positive patients (67.24% of all HBoV positive patients and 69.23% of HBoV positive children) were HBoV single positive, indicating it may have potential pathogenicity, especially in infants. Therefore, to better elucidate its pathogenic roles, the clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive outpatients/emergency cases were analyzed for comparison with HBoV-positive inpatients (Table 3). The results showed that the HBoV positive rate in outpatients/emergency was statistically lower than inpatients, and the odds of infection with HBoV resulting in severe disease (or admission) were as high as 5.21. HBoV positive pediatric patients were more diagnosed as lower respiratory tract illness than adults in both inpatients and outpatients, and pediatric inpatients were more likely coinfected with other viruses. Although there was possibility that other co-pathogens not be screened in this study may exist, these results showed that HBoV may have pathogenic role in causing severe disease/admission or lower respiratory tract illness of children. In addition, our results showed that HBoV was related to asthma or its exacerbation, which occurred in 10 pediatric patients.",

In our study, we found 6 HBoV-positive adult cases in 1774 adult patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and the 3.4\u2030 prevalence rate was in accordance with those previously reported for adults [2], [8], [12], [29], [30]. Although HBoV infection was rare in adults with respiratory infection in our study population, it was still notable that HBoV may cause exacerbation in adults with basic or primary pulmonary disease like COPD. We found 52 HBoV-positive pediatric patients, which represented 3.1% positive rate in pediatric patients with respiratory infection. This is similar to other reports of 1.5%\u201319%.

The most frequently detected co-pathogen was HCoV, different from previous reports in China [12], [15], and the reason may lie in different climate/geography conditions and virus distribution. There was no obvious evidence that co-infection of HBoV and other common respiratory viruses can increase the disease severity, since no correlation was found between co-infection and clinical symptoms, and the rate of lower respiratory tract illness did not increase in co-infection cases.",

To exclude PCR contamination and prevent false positive and false negative results in HBoV and other 6 common respiratory viruses screening, the following strategies were used. Firstly, all PCR was strictly carried out in 4 separate rooms, namely, reagent preparation, sample preparation, PCR and PCR-product rooms. Secondly, each PCR/real-time PCR assay was performed in duplicates and repeated three times. Thirdly, positive samples were further confirmed by PCR using another set of primers, and for some of the 6 common respiratory viruses positive samples, viral isolation and determination was performed to further confirm the PCR positive results.",

Gene analysis showed high identity (98.8%) between each other, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that they belonged to HBoV1, which was more frequently detected in respiratory tract illness than other genotypes. Phylogenetic tree of complete genome showed that different strains of HBoV1 can be divided into three groups. It is noteworthy that the two strains identified in this study (GZ4785 and GZ9081), which were circulating at the same time during the 1 year study period, belonged to different groups. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis results showed that most Chinese HBoV1 strains obtained from respiratory samples belonged to group I which was genetically closely to ST2, but GZ9081 was different, which belonged to group III. Phylogenetic trees based on different HBoV ORFs showed that its NS1 gene was closely homologous to the ST1 group, whereas its NP1 and VP1/VP2 genes resembled the CU74 group, suggesting it may be a recombinant. Although generally HBoV1 sequences were highly conserved, there were still evidences that the recombination existed among HBoVs [22], and co-infection of HBoVs [20] might increase the chance of recombination between HBoVs. Therefore, we suspect that GZ9081 may be a hybrid virus. So a recombinant detection program was performed to analyze GZ9081. The result confirmed that GZ9081 was an intra-genotype of HBoV1 recombinant, originated from the parental strains ST1 and CU74 (Fig. 5). As far as we know, this is the first time that recombination between HBoV1 is reported and this is the first recombinant strain of HBoV1 reported in China. Since recombination could change virulence or antigenicity of viruses, we believe that the finding of HBoV recombination might have significance on the epidemiology, seroprotection and pathogenicity study of HBoV. Further studies are needed to examine the virulence and antigenic changes of GZ9081 strain. Continuous surveillance and genome sequence analysis are needed to obtain more information on the genotypic variation and molecular evolution of HBoV in China.",
