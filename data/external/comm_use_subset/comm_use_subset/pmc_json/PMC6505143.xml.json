Finally, genotypes in the founders perfectly predict the genotypes in F1 hybrids. There are 6,293 such markers distributed across the genome. Markers where the three samples per strain had one or more H calls or do not share the same genotype call were treated as evidence of residual heterozygosity. Within each strain, clusters of markers with evidence of residual heterozygosity were combined to conservatively estimate the fraction of the genome with residual heterozygosity. To estimate relatedness between samples genotyped in MiniMUGA and their corresponding CC strain, we used a subset of 3,295 markers that overlapped between GigaMUGA and MiniMUGA genotyping platforms.",

Likewise the sample or samples with BB as the maximum probability with value r, r was added to AB and BB set to 0). Once the discordant inbred probabilities were redistributed within a sample\u2019s marker, the maximum probability for each founder-state was then selected from the set of obligate ancestors and the resulting vector of 36 maximum probabilities were normalized.

The msBWT data structure is a lossless compressed representation of the raw sequenced reads that can be efficiently queried for any specific subsequence. The msBWTs were employed in two pipelines. The first was to query each genome against the set of annotated variants from the Sanger Institute (Keane et al. 2011) that are informative among the CC founders. This set of queries was described in Srivastava et al. 2017. The msBWTs were then queried against 45 base pair subsequences (both forward and reverse complement) from the Mus musculus reference genome (GRCm38.68) overlapping by 15 base pairs.

The msBWT reports the number of reads containing each 45-base substring in both forward and reverse-complement orientations. In order to mitigate for random sequencing errors and contamination due to \u201cindex-hopping\u201d (van der Valk et al. 2018), we selected a minimum threshold of at least 3 reads as sufficient evidence of a 45-mer\u2019s presence in each sample. Once missing 45-mer intervals were identified the msBWT was used to extract the flanking non-zero reads at the interval boundaries, and a consensus sequence was constructed for 45 to 60 bases inside of the missing interval. If this consensus was consistent with a simple polymorphism the new consensus sequence was used to extend the flanking sequence, and the msBWT was used to further extend into the near-zero interval until either the gap closed, or the new consensus\u2019 edit distance from the reference was inconsistent with a simple polymorphism.",

Specifically, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ and CAST/EiJ haplotypes are present in a 17 Mb region on chromosome 15 (31,869,802-58,735,934). All six new strains have haplotype contributions from all eight founders while almost 20% of the previously released strains have only six or seven founders (Table 2). Overall, three founder haplotypes (A/J, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) are overrepresented and two (NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ) are underrepresented in the six new strains (Table 2). Importantly, two of the overrepresented founders (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) are of non-domesticus origin (Table 1 & 2). These two founders were underrepresented in the previous report (Srivastava et al. 2017). We also previously reported that wild derived founder haplotypes were significantly overrepresented in regions of residual heterozygosity in the CC (Srivastava et al. 2017). We observe the same pattern in the new CC strains where wild-derived haplotypes are enriched in regions of residual heterozygosity (P < 0.0001).",

            "text": "The six new CC strains contribute at least one CAST/EiJ or PWK/PhJ haplotype to 62% and 54% of the genome, respectively. This partially relieves the deficit of these underrepresented haplotypes in the CC population. For example, chromosome 5 contains a locus between 127Mb and 137Mb where currently only one CC strain has a CAST/EiJ founder haplotype (Figure 1). The new CC strains add an extra homozygous CAST/EiJ haplotype into the CC population on chromosome 5. Another example is chromosome X where the previously released CC strains have a low frequency (< 5%) of haplotypes from CAST/EiJ or PWK/PhJ. The six new CC strains add at least one haplotype from CAST/EiJ or PWK/PhJ, spanning 70% and 41% of the entire X chromosome, respectively. The addition of strains with underrepresented haplotypes is important for different reasons. First, it increases power for genetic mapping in the CC simply by increasing the number of tested haplotypes. Additional strains with the relevant haplotypes also enable independent validation experiments in the CC (Shorter et al. 2017). Interestingly, there are regions in the CC population where non-domesticus haplotypes are not represented at all (chromosome 5: 61Mb to 64Mb; Figure 1). These areas have a decreased non-domesticus haplotype frequency on the periphery of the highlighted area, suggesting selection is acting against those particular haplotypes in the CC.",

By directly sequencing CC strains, we can define founder specific variants across multiple CC strains sharing a founder haplotype at each locus, and identify strain specific variation unique to a CC strain. We first compared the sequenced samples\u2019 GigaMUGA genotypes and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding MRCA. Next, we queried variation within identical founder haplotype regions at any given locus across the CC to identify de novo mutations. We identified four unique de novo deletions larger than 500bp in the newly sequenced mice that are not present in the assembled reference genome of the CC founders or in the previous cohort of 69 sequenced CC mice (Table 3). Figure 2 shows a 19.8kb deletion in CC079/TauUnc that is predicted to delete the Gm14515 gene. The breakpoints were resolved using msBWTs to locally assemble sequence flanking the deletion. A PCR assay was designed to discriminate between the presence or absence of this deletion, and the deletion was fixed in both the MRCA and the three CC079/TauUnc mice tested. We conclude that this mutation arose before or during the early CC inbreeding stages. Mutation and genetic drift may cause distinct variation to arise and become fixed in individual CC strains leading to genetic differences between founder strains and their haplotypes in the CC population.",

We selected this sex ratio to sample the Y chromosome in each colony and to increase the X chromosome representation in the analysis. First, we confirmed that all sampled mice had consistent Y and mitochondria with their respective MRCA and sequenced sample. Next, we confirmed that all sampled mice had autosomal genotypes that matched with their respective sequenced sample using 3,295 markers common to MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA (Figure S1, Table S2, Table S3). We observe that each of the 216 samples most closely match their respective sequenced sample. This set of markers is sufficient to distinguish two closely related CC strains (CC051/TauUnc and CC059/TauUnc) (Figure S1). The colony survey also allows us to estimate current levels of corresponding MRCA (Figure 3A). The four clear outliers that have both a high level of current heterozygosity and a small decrease in residual heterozygosity are four of the six new CC strains. We hypothesize that the overrepresentation of non-domesticus haplotypes combined with high initial residual heterozygosity and small number of generations between MRCAs and genotyped samples contributes to the low change in residual heterozygosity.",

The genotypes of these strains are available at https://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotypes. Using a subset of 3,295 markers that overlap between MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA, we verified that genotypes of these mice were consistent with the sequenced samples and can be used as a comparison resource (Figure S1, Table S2, Table S3). We recommend that users of the CC preserve tissue samples from all CC mice (and derivatives) used in an experiment. Genetic mapping using genotypes from parental mice (i.e., breeders) would provide the most accurate estimation of current segregating haplotypes for that population. This will also facilitate the correction of potential errors in mouse identity, and serve as a validation of key resources. Our colony sampling of the CC at the SGCF highlights that residual heterozygosity is decreasing, but still present. For experiments where residual heterozygosity could disrupt analysis (i.e. vQTL mapping studies, F2 mapping studies, recombinant inbred crosses), accurate analyses and interpretation of experimental results will likely benefit from genotyping individual experimental animals to ensure accurate haplotype assignment. Residual heterozygosity may also influence genetic mapping and the presence of QTL, if only one of the two haplotypes at a locus influences a trait (Rogala et al. 2014). QTL that have residual heterozygosity may be a double-edged sword. Fixation of a haplotype (or population subsampling) may impede experimental replication in later studies. Alternately, residual heterozygosity can allow for QTL validation studies utilizing a segregating locus within a strain.",
