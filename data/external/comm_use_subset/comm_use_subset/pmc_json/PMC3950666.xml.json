Exon skipping via splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to bypass the mutated exons of dystrophin gene has shown great promise (4\u20136). In this approach, SSOs target the splice sites of dystrophin pre-mRNA, induce exon skipping, enable the restoration of an open reading frame and give rise to the expression of a truncated but functional dystrophin protein (5\u20137). Early studies have established the viability of this strategy in animal models (mostly in mdx mice) of DMD (8\u201310). Recently, small-scale clinical trials using 2\u2019-O methyl phosphorothioates (11,12) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) (13,14) have also established the proof-of-concept applicability of exon skipping for the potential treatment of DMD.",

Most advances have been made with SSOs (mostly uncharged PMOs, which bind to RNA with high affinity) covalently linked to CPPs, giving rise to a series of conjugates termed peptide-PMOs or PPMOs. Initial studies were conducted with the arginine-rich (RXR)4 peptide (with X standing for aminohexanoic acid) (20,21) and later with its (RXRRBR)2 (B-peptide) derivative (22,23). Both allowed exon skipping and dystrophin rescue at much lower doses than free SSOs in skeletal muscles, with B-peptide also exhibiting some activity in the heart (24). In parallel, a R6-Penetratin (R6-Pen) conjugate (25) was proposed and further modified to improve serum stability and biological activity profile giving rise to a new class of PMO/PNA internalization peptides called Pips (26).",

            "text": "Further developments of these Pip peptides led to the introduction of a central hydrophobic core motif (ILFQY sequence) and generated the Pip5 series of PPMOs (27). These PPMOs were extensively screened in the mdx mouse model of DMD and Pip5e-PMO was identified as a promising candidate that allowed high-dystrophin restoration in both skeletal and cardiac muscles, although with lower efficiency in the latter ones (27). Additional structure-activity studies, using Pip5e as a starting sequence, were carried out to identify which elements in this peptide are important for improving cardiac delivery. These novel derivatives were named Pip6 peptides (28). The data showed that heart muscle activity was due to the presence of a central 5-amino acid hydrophobic sequence, but the exact sequence seemed less important than its length. Among these PPMOs belonging to the Pip6 family, Pip6a-PMO has been chosen for further studies such as pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and muscle physiology. However, little is known to date concerning the cellular trafficking of PMOs and PPMOs, such as Pip6a-PMO, in different muscle cell types. High doses of naked PMO do allow efficient delivery to the DMD-affected skeletal muscles in vivo (29). Unaided cellular uptake of PMO is thought to be dependent on the increased sarcolemmal membrane permeability, as lack of dystrophin renders the cellular membrane prone to mechanical stress-induced disruptions, making them leaky (30). However, to our knowledge, there is no direct evidence supporting this hypothesis. It is also unknown if there are major differences between the uptake of PMOs and PPMOs into undifferentiated and differentiated skeletal muscle cells, i.e. myoblasts and myotubes, that would be responsible for the often uneven restoration of dystrophin in different muscle fibres. Furthermore, heart muscle always seems to represent a more challenging barrier to achieve efficient dystrophin correction, as naked PMOs are only weakly active at high repeated doses in this tissue (29), whereas PPMO conjugates are more active but give less activity in heart than in skeletal muscle (27,28).",

Cellular uptake was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, as FACS analysis cannot be performed with myotubes.

Minimal differences in the uptake profile of Pip6a-PMO in H2k mdx (Figure 2A) and C2C12 (Supplementary Figure S5A) myotubes were observed, although fluorescence levels were slightly more elevated in H2k myotubes.

Differentiated H2k mdx myotubes were pre-treated with the inhibitors for 30 min\u2014NaN3 and 2\u2032-Deoxy-D-Glucose (DDG) for ATP-depletion (-ATP); chlorpromazine (CPZ) for clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibition; nystatin (Nys) for caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibition; and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) for macropinocytosis inhibition. Cells were then treated with Pip6a-PMO at a 250 nM concentration for 4 h in the presence of the inhibitors. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that energy-depletion significantly decreased the uptake of Pip6a-PMO (Figure 4A), although the exon-skipping activity was completely abolished (Figure 4B).

Pip6a-PMO was much more effective in exon skipping than naked PMO and previously described PPMO conjugates.

Leakiness is also thought to be responsible for the improved uptake of naked SSOs, but little direct evidence has been provided. We, therefore, studied the behaviour of Pip6a-PMO conjugate and naked PMO in differentiated myotubes with a DMD (i.e. H2k mdx cells) or a normal (C2C12 cells) phenotype. Our results indicate that Pip6a-PMO is taken up into both types of myotubes with comparable efficiency and, accordingly, the parity is retained in exon-skipping levels (Figure 2). Moreover, the uptake and intracellular distribution of Pip6a-PMO follow a similar pattern in H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5C). Slight differences in the biological activity of Pip6a-PMO could be detected, however at longer incubation time, i.e. 24 h, exon-skipping activity in the H2k mdx myotubes (EC50 = 30 nM) was slightly higher than in C2C12 myotubes (EC50 = 107 nM) (Supplementary Figure S3).

In this context, we hypothesized that different SSO/PMO uptake depends on the regenerative capacity of the various muscle types (i.e. different activity or proportion of myoblasts). Therefore, cellular uptake/trafficking of SSOs/PPMOs in undifferentiated and differentiated cells could be different. Our data show that the internalization of Pip6a-PMO is significantly lower in myoblasts than in myotubes (both in H2k mdx or C2C12 cells) (Supplementary Figure S5C). Moreover, the intracellular trafficking of Pip6a-PMO is completely different in myoblasts, where Pip6a-PMO is mostly confined in endocytic vesicles, whereas a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and a strong nuclear accumulation are prevalent in myotubes (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5C). However, this is not due to different densities of nuclei, as equal amounts were found in myoblasts and myotubes (data not shown). It thus seems that endosomal entrapment of Pip6a-PMO, which is much higher in myoblasts than in myotubes, contributes more to the lower exon-skipping efficiency in myoblasts as compared with myotubes (EC50 = 183 nM in H2k mdx myoblasts versus EC50 = 30 nM in myotubes) than the slightly lower cellular uptake (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Regarding cardiac muscle, on systemic injections of mdx mice, Pip6a-PMO is remarkable in promoting dystrophin expression in the heart, although less efficiently than in skeletal muscles (28). The reason for this has not been clear. Recently, Pip5e-PMO (from which Pip6a-PMO was derived) showed increased nuclear accumulation in the cardiac muscle tissue in live heart slices compared with B-PMO (27). It is worth noting that Pip5e and Pip6a differ only by inversion of the central 5 amino acid core and otherwise show identical exon-skipping levels in mdx skeletal muscle cells (27, 28). An initial report using RXR4-PMO has shown 22% exon 23 skipping in isolated mdx mouse cardiomyocytes, apparently similar to that in H2k mdx cells (36), but no direct comparison of a Pip-PMO in cardiac muscle cells has been reported before. Our study of Pip6a-PMO in primary cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal mdx and wild-type mice hearts [these cells are fully differentiated as attested by their beating properties (37)] showed that Pip6a-PMO is less efficient in inducing exon 23 skipping in cardiomyocytes than in skeletal muscle cells (with an EC50 \u223c1 \u00b5M in cardiomyocytes as compared with EC50 between 30 and 200 nM in skeletal muscle cells) (Figure 5B). By contrast, no significant difference was found in the exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO between DMD and wild-type phenotypes. Thus, in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, the DMD phenotype does not seem to be an important determinant of Pip6a-PMO efficiency. This thoroughly disproves the concept that PMOs and PPMOs are only active because mdx cells are somehow more \u2018leaky\u2019 than normal cells. Further, most Pip6a-PMO remains entrapped in endocytic vesicles with a pattern reminiscent of the distribution found in skeletal muscle myoblasts. Therefore, unfavourable intracellular trafficking and greater endosomal entrapment appear to be a major cause of the decreased cardiac activity of Pip6a-PMO compared with skeletal muscles.",

In an earlier study, it was shown in the HeLa pluc705 cell line (a widely used model to study SSOs trafficking) that Pip2b-PNA conjugates used clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access to the cells (26). However, studies carried out in a cancer cell line cannot be extrapolated to muscle cells. In this study, we aimed to elucidate which endocytic pathways would be responsible for the trafficking and biological activity of Pip6a-PMO in muscle cells. For this purpose, we investigated the impact of different pharmacological endoytosis inhibitors (used at highest non-toxic concentration in a given cell type) on the Pip6a-PMO-mediated delivery to the different muscle cell types, focusing on skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. In H2k mdx cells, Pip6a-PMO is trafficking by an energy-dependent process involving caveolae-mediated endocytosis (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S6). Interestingly, the same trend was observed in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes, indicating that the lower exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO (Figures 1 and 2) in myoblasts is not due to differences in the uptake pathway (Figure 4C). Moreover, we showed that caveolae-mediated uptake mechanism also occurs in C2C12 cells (data not shown), which confirms that this endocytosis route is the preferential one in skeletal muscle cells with both DMD and wild-type phenotypes.",

First, nuclear delivery is more efficient in differentiated myotubes than in undifferentiated myoblasts in skeletal muscle cells. Second, cardiomyocytes behave differently from H2k mdx myotubes both in terms of Pip6a-PMO uptake pathway and in terms of cellular trafficking. In both cases, segregation within endocytic vesicles seems to limit nuclear delivery and as a consequence exon-skipping efficiency. Cell screening in primary cardiomyocytes isolated from mdx mice in addition to H2k mdx skeletal muscle cells before in vivo evaluation would be predicted to accelerate the discovery of new and more efficient PPMOs and lead to clinically promising developments.",
