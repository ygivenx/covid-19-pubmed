The greatest threats posed by this virus are its ability to cause mortality in humans, its potential to compromise food supplies, and its possible economic impacts. Viral maintenance in poultry potentiates the risk of human-to-human transmission and the emergence of a pandemic strain through reassortment. An effective, safe poultry vaccine that elicits broadly protective immune responses to evolving flu strains would provide a countermeasure to reduce the likelihood of transmission of this virus from domestic birds to humans and simultaneously would protect commercial poultry operations and subsistence farmers.",

In human trials, these vaccines elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against various infectious agents, including influenza, SARS, SIV and HIV. In addition to their ability to elicit antibody responses, they also stimulate antigen-specific and sustained T cell responses [1]\u2013[3], [6], [12], [13]. DNA vaccination has been used experimentally against various infectious agents in a variety of mammals, including cattle (against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/bovine diarrhea virus, leptospirosis and mycobacteriosis) [14], [15], pigs (against classical swine fever virus and mycoplasmosis) [16], and horses (against West Nile virus and rabies) [17]. In addition, DNA vaccines have been tested against avian plasmodium infection in penguins [18] and against influenza and infectious bursal disease in chickens [7], [8], [19], duck hepatitis B virus in ducks [6], and avian metapneumovirus and Chlamydia psittaci in turkeys [20], [21] (reviewed in ref. [22]). While they have been used in chickens to generate antisera to specific influenza viruses and confer protection against the low pathogenicity H5N2 strain [23], there is only one previous report of a monovalent DNA vaccine effective against H5N1 (and that only against a matched H5N1 isolate) [24]; no protection with multivalent DNA vaccines against heterologous strains has been reported.",

The virus can infect humans, typically from animal sources, including commercial and wild avian species, livestock, and possibly other non-domesticated animal species [25]\u2013[27]. While there is marked diversity in the host range of type A influenza viruses, many experts have speculated that a pandemic strain of type A influenza could evolve in avian species or avian influenza viruses could contribute virulent genes to a pandemic strain through reassortment [28], [29]. Thus, there is reason to consider vaccination of poultry that would stimulate potent and broad protective immune responses [7], [30], [31]. In undertaking such efforts, it is important that there be a differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals [32] so that animals can be protected and permit monitoring of new infections using proven and sensitive methodologies.",

The findings suggest that it is possible to develop a multivalent DNA vaccine for poultry that can protect against multiple HPAI H5N1 strains and that could keep pace with the continued evolution of avian influenza viruses.",

Expression vectors encoding HAs from ten phylogenetically diverse strains of influenza viruses [33] were generated by synthesis of cDNAs (see Materials and Methods) in plasmid expression vectors, pCMV/R or pCMV/R 8\u03baB, which mediates high level expression and immunogenicity in vivo\n[34], [35], [36]. Animals were immunized with each expression vector intramuscularly (IM) at three week intervals, and the antisera were evaluated on day 14 after the third immunization for their ability to neutralize HPAI H5N1 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors as previously described [35], [36]. We have previously shown that lentiviral assay inhibition (LAI) yields similar results to microneutralization and HAI analyses with higher sensitivity in mice [35], [36]. Significant neutralizing antibodies generated to homologous HAs were detected consistently by LAI with few exceptions, while cross reactivity to a standard isolate, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, was variable. For example, IC90 titers exceeding 1\u2236800 were observed against A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006 and A/Hong Kong/156/1997, while a lesser response was detected for the A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003 strain (Fig. 1). Heterologous neutralization to A/Vietnam/1203/2004 was variable and did not fully correlate with the degree of relatedness of the specific HA. The ability of these immunogens to generate robust cross-reactive antibodies is consistent with previous observations [4], [37], [38].",

As expected, there were substantial differences in the breadth of neutralization between these two sets of 5 immunogen multivalent vaccines (Fig. 2, B vs. C). In one set, while neutralization of homologous strains was comparable to the monovalent and the 10 immunogen multivalent immune response, fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected, directed most prominently against A/Iraq/207-NAMRU3/2006 and A/Egypt/ 2782-NAMRU3/2006 (Fig. 2B; 5 HA, Set 1). In contrast, set 2 elicited consistent and comparable neutralization against both homologous and heterologous viruses at titers exceeding 1\u2236400 against most of the tested HA strains (Fig. 2C; 5 HA, Set 2), as observed in the 10 component multivalent DNA vaccine.

Animals were then challenged with 10 LD50 of the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus intranasally, and morbidity and mortality were monitored for 21 days after the viral challenge. The control animals, injected with the plasmid expression vector with no insert, died within 10 days of infection. Complete survival was observed in the groups immunized with the 10 component and set 2 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccines (Fig. 3). Immunization with HA derived from the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain or set 1 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccine showed a survival rate approaching 90%. In contrast, animals injected with HA plasmid DNA derived from A/Anhui/1/2005, which has diverged more from A/Vietnam/1203/2004, showed a lower percent survival (70%) after lethal viral challenge. Survival differences between groups were assessed using a log-rank test and the Gehan-Wilcoxon test on the survival curves for pairs of groups. A test was deemed significant if the p-value was <0.01. Mice injected IM with different HAs, A/Indonesia/5/05, A/Anhui/1/05, 10HA, 5 HA (Set 1), or 5 HA (Set 2) showed a significant difference compared to control (all p values<0.001). Among the HA-immunized groups, there was no significant difference between any two groups (p>0.08 for all comparisons). For example, no significant difference was observed between the A/Anhui/1/05 group, which had the least survival among the HA immunized groups (7 out of 10), and other HA groups: A/Indonesia/5/05 (p = 0.377), 10 HA (p = 0.082), 5 HA (Set 1) (p = 0.101), or 5 HA (Set 2) (p = .411).

Neutralization of the Indonesia HA strain was the most robust, with neutralization nearing 100% at titers greater than 1\u22363200. Both the monovalent and multivalent vaccines elicited robust homologous (Fig. 4, A/Indonesia/05/2005) and heterologous HA neutralization (Fig. 4, A/Nigeria/641/05). Similar responses were noted in the other groups, including administration of monovalent HA-A/Indonesia/05/2005 subcutaneously by needle syringe and via Agro-Jet\u00ae (Fig. 4, second row). The neutralization response of chickens immunized with monovalent Indonesia was similar to that of the trivalent vaccine(Fig. 4). Even though one chicken (238) in the multivalent vaccine group produced almost the same degree of neutralization at each time point and was protected, it did not produce a high neutralizing antibody titer for reasons that were uncertain but possibly related to a non-specific inhibitor in the sera.",

Both modes provided complete protection for all animals at doses higher than this, and 25% protection for the animals receiving 0.5 \u00b5g doses (Fig. 5B, C). Survival differences between consecutive doses were assessed using a log-rank test on the survival curves for pairs of groups.

Chickens that were injected using Agro-Jet\u00ae showed a significant difference between 0.5 and 5 \u00b5g (p = .004) and between control and 5, 50, and 500 \u00b5g (p<.001 for all comparisons). There were no differences between control and 0.5 \u00b5g or between 5, 50, and 500 \u00b5g. Lastly, the survival differences between Agro-Jet\u00ae and IM for each dose group were not significant. The neutralizing antibody response to homologous and heterologous HAs corresponded with protection and correlated with dose, with higher titers elicited by injection with Agro-Jet\u00ae compared to needle (Table S2). We assessed viable viral shedding after inoculation by chick embryo inoculation three days after virus challenge (Week 8). While we noted some embryonic lethality at the 0.5 \u00b5g dose, there was no embryonic lethality at 5, 50 or 500 \u00b5g groups (data not shown).",

In addition to its effects on human health by cross-species transmission [28], [45], [46] and ability to compromise food sources, it poses a continuing threat to public health as it evolves and adapts in different species. The pandemic potential of this virus, especially as it relates to the poultry industry and for reservoir avian hosts, underscores the need for a vaccine that offers broad spectrum immunity and protection against lethal viral challenge. While the virus remains restricted in its ability to infect humans and undergo efficient human-to-human transmission [28], [47], its persistence and spread in poultry increases the risk of the emergence of a pandemic strain. One approach to pandemic risk reduction is to limit the propagation of the virus in poultry and other relevant avian species.",

Because they do not contain other viral proteins used to screen for infection, they also address the need to differentiate vaccinated from infected animals.

A multivalent H5 vaccine containing diverse serotypes could expand the antigenic breadth sufficiently to provide protection against heterologous challenge and may preclude the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains that may arise due to evolutionary vaccine pressure on the virus. Due to the antigenic drift and shift of the influenza virus genome, it has been very difficult to predict the next dominant strain of an avian endemic outbreak. DNA vaccines can be synthesized in a relatively short period of time, and the targeted mutations can be tailored to specific viral serotypes. The mutations promote a focused and enhanced immune response [3], [49], [50] that may be particularly important in the event of an outbreak where specificity is the key to epidemic control. The use of modified codons ensures maximal expression in the host and eliminates the possibility of recombination with influenza viruses that might potentially generate new strains.",

For the single plasmid groups, the DNA plasmid in a volume of 100 \u00b5l was administered to each animal: pCMV/R 8\u03baB, pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Hong Kong/156/1997), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Hong Kong/483/1997), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Egypt/2782-NAMRU3/2006), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006), and pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Iraq/207-NAMRU3/2006). The 10 plasmid combination group (10 HA) received 1.5 \u00b5g DNA for each of the 10 HA plasmids (total 15 \u00b5g) as used in the single plasmid groups mentioned above. For the two 5 plasmid combination groups [5 HA (Set1), 5 HA(Set 2)], 3 \u00b5g of each plasmid DNA were used as total DNA remained the same (15 \u00b5g). 5 HA (Set 1) group contained: pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Hong Kong/156/1997), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Egypt/2782-NAMRU3/2006), and pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006). 5 HA (Set 2) group contained: pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004), pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Hong Kong/483/1997), and pCMV/R 8\u03baB-HA(A/Iraq/207-NAMRU3/2006).

Controls died 2 days after infection by nasal inoculation. The geometric mean reciprocal endpoint titers (GMT) for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) in each group one week after the last vaccination and two weeks post-challenge respectively were: Control: undetectable, not done; Trivalent by Agro-Jet (\u00d73): 777, 304; A/Indonesia/05/2005 by Agro-Jet (\u00d73): 320, 285; A/Indonesia/05/2005 by Agro-Jet (\u00d72): 516, 533; A/Indonesia/05/2005 by needle (subcutaneous \u00d73): 211, 155; A/Indonesia/05/2005 by Agro-Jet (intramuscular \u00d73): 118, 495. B. Immunization with trivalent DNA vaccine, pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), and pCMV/R-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006), twice by Agro-Jet\u00ae intradermally/subcutaneously in different doses (500 \u00b5g, 50 \u00b5g, 5 \u00b5g, and 0.5 \u00b5g) as indicated. Controls were immunized with 500 \u00b5g empty vector. Controls died 4 days after infection by intranasal inoculation. The GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: 80 (n = 1); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (500 \u00b5g): 580 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (50 \u00b5g): 430 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (5 \u00b5g): 183 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (0.5 \u00b5g): 200 (n = 2). C. Immunization with trivalent DNA vaccine pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), and HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006) was performed twice by needle and syringe IM at doses outlined in panel B. The GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: not done (n = 0); Trivalent by needle (500 \u00b5g): 325 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (50 \u00b5g): 120 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (5 \u00b5g): 197 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (0.5 \u00b5g): 200 (n = 2). The chickens in panel B and C each received two immunizations.",
