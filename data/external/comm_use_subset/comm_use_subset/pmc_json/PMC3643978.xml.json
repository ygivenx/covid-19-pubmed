That study showed that the influenza B virus induces an IFN response even if its infectivity is disabled by ultraviolet light. Therefore, initial viral transcription, replication, and viral protein synthesis are unnecessary for influenza B virus-induced antiviral responses, while influenza A viral infections activated IFN responses only after viral RNA synthesis. It is thus proposed that the early influenza virus-host cell interactions differ between influenza A and B viruses [17]. The differences in the early host recognition of the influenza A and B viruses may be associated with different influenza virus pathogenicities, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. The early host recognition of influenza B may contribute to faster and more effective restriction and faster clearance of influenza B viral infections [17].",

However, influenza virus type (A versus B) was not shown to be a significant independent risk factors of hospitalization in patients with influenza in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, the frequency of underlying comorbid conditions, and the proportion of elderly were lower in patients with influenza B compared to influenza A in this study. Therefore, younger age and the lower frequency of underlying comorbid conditions may be associated with milder clinical courses of patients with influenza B viral infections, while the possibility exists that influenza B virus is less pathogenic.

            "text": "However, this study has some few limitations. First, the influenza cases in this study were a selected sample, as we selected only patients who visited the emergency room. As a result, patients who did not visit emergency rooms were excluded. This could represent a sampling bias. Second, since the sensitivity of RT-PCR was not 100%, true influenza positive patients might be regarded as influenza negative. Third, routine laboratory tests such as white blood cell and blood platelet counts were performed and estimated for only some enrolled patients. Fourth, data regarding comorbid conditions might be underestimated as we only analyzed emergency room medical records. Fifth, we had no data on whether there was mismatch between the different strains of virus isolated and influenza vaccination in the 2011\u20132012 season, as we did not analyze detailed sequence data.",

Hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disorders, and neuromuscular diseases were independently associated with hospitalization due to laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H3N2) or B, while influenza virus type (A versus B) and elderly were not independent factors associated with hospitalization. Patients with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular disorders or neuromuscular diseases) were at greater risk of hospitalization after influenza viral infection. Physicians should assess and treat the underlying comorbid conditions as well as influenza viral infections for the appropriate management of patients with influenza.",
