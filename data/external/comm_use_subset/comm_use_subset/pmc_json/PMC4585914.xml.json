Thus, evidence of episodic positive selection was searched for by using the codeml branch-site test22, which is relatively insensitive to the saturation of substitution rates23. In the S1 and S2 regions, 3 and 4 branches yielded statistically significant evidence of positive selection under different codon frequency models (Fig. 1B, Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3). Positively selected sites along these branches were detected using the BEB (Bayes empirical Bayes) procedure and validated using the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME)24.",

Nevertheless, recombination was not accounted for in that analysis. We thus analyzed the sequence alignments of the Hong Kong isolates for the presence of recombination breakpoints using GARD. The algorithm detected 9 recombination breakpoints for the Pi-BatCoV HKU5 alignment (Fig. 1A) and none for Ty-BatCoV HKU4. The Ty-BatCoV HKU4 spike gene was therefore analyzed using the codeml site models, which test the hypothesis that a subset of codons evolve with dN/dS > 1. No evidence of positive selection was found, even using the relatively non-conservative model M7/model M8 comparison (Supplementary Table S4). As for the Pi-BatCoV HKU5 spike gene, rampant recombination prevents application of a similar approach. We thus resorted to the simultaneous estimation of selection and recombination using omegaMap29. This analysis confirmed high recombination along the whole gene (Supplementary Fig. S1) and detected a single positively selected site in the S1 region (Fig. 1C). The same site (codon 198, position relative to the MERS-CoV spike sequence) was also detected by MEME, which was run by incorporating the alternative phylogenies detected by GARD. Most of the previously reported selected sites28 were not detected using other methods that account for recombination (Supplementary Table S5). We thus consider that robust inference of positive selection in Pi-BatCoV HKU5 spike genes can only be made for position 198, which lies outside the RBD (Fig. 1A).",

It should be noted, though, that in all analyses we applied quite conservative approaches and we intersected two different methods to declare a site as positively selected. Whereas this approach was meant to limit the false positive rate it may have yielded some false negative results. In particular, the branch-site test we used to analyze the S1 and S2 regions of betaCoVs is robust to saturation issues and has a minimal false positive rate, but lacks power23. Moreover, due to the high divergence and the consequent need of alignment pruning, analysis of the RBD was performed on a shallower phylogeny compared to the other regions. This procedure is expected to reduce power, but is nonetheless necessary. In fact, alignment errors, together with unrecognized recombination, inflate estimates of positive selection and represent major sources of false positive results in evolutionary analyses2035. Consistently, when we accounted for recombination in Pi-BatCoV HKU5 sequences most previously described selection signals disappeared, including those in the RBD28. Thus, whereas we cannot exclude that adaptive variants in the RBD of betaCoVs were missed by our approach, we conclude that the more recent evolution of MERS-CoV, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 was not driven by positive selection in this domain. Conversely, as previously shown for SARS-CoV25, our data support a role for the S1 region separating the RBD and fusion peptide as a determinant of betaCoV host range expansion.",

Most positively selected sites were found to be located either in the heptad repeats or in the intervening linker. Among these sites, position 1060 is particularly interesting, as it almost corresponds to substitutions that modify the host range and/or cell tropism in MHV and IBV2627. Both viruses belong to the coronavirus genus. The Beaudette strain of IBV has been adapted to embryonated chicken eggs; following passages in culture, the strain was further adapted to infect Vero cells (from African Green monkey) and primary chicken kidney cells26. The L857F mutation was shown to represent a major determinant of the fusogenic activity in these cell types26. As far as MHV is concerned, the E1035D mutation was recovered after passages in mouse liver and was shown to contribute significantly to the hepatotropism and hepatic virulence of a previously attenuated strain (MHV-A59)27. Additional variants in the HR1 and fusion peptide of MHV strains cooperate with changes in the S1 region, resulting in a broadening of receptor usage (to heparan sulfate) and, consequently, an extension of the host range36. Finally, in the MHV-A51 strain the ability to bind human CAECAM receptors is strongly influenced by mutant residues located in the fusion peptide, HR1 and HR1/HR2 linker37. Similar observations have been reported for viruses that do not belong to the coronavirus genus, but that use a class I fusion protein. For instance, one single mutation in the HR1 of a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) strain (KB9) increases by two- to three-fold infection efficiency in cells expressing the marmoset cellular receptors38, whereas a nearby HR1 change in SIV contributes to macrophage tropism39. Overall, these findings pinpoint the relevance of changes in the HR1 and HR2 as modifiers of host range and cell-type tropism.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the altered phenotype of HR1 and HR2 mutants remain to be determined in all these instances, although changes in conformational structure have been suggested as a possible explanation. Unfortunately, no coronavirus S protein fusion intermediate or pre-fusion state has been solved to date, hampering investigation of molecular interactions. We therefore analyzed the effect of variation at the 1020 position of MERS-CoV on the stability of the 6HB in the post-fusion conformation14. The presence of a Q1020 had previously been suggested to confer higher stability to the MERS-CoV 6HB compared to SARS-CoV14. Indeed, replacement of this residue results in loss of intra- and inter-helical interactions. In line with these observations, three different methods used for stability analysis were concordant in showing that the alternative arginine and histidine residues at position 1020 result in a moderate and similar level of destabilization. Although the observed \u0394\u0394G is relatively small, it was calculated on the single monomer, and is expected to be multiplied in the trimer. The observation whereby mildly destabilizing variants are favored by selection may seem counterintuitive. Nonetheless, we show that a similar level of destabilization is observed for a mutation in MERS-Cov HR1 (T1015N) that increases infection efficiency, at least in vitro31. Mutagenesis of HR1 in retroviral type I fusion proteins has indicated that, whereas strong destabilization of the 6HB (as measured by circular dichroism) almost inevitably results in reduced infectivity, a minor stability decrease is not necessarily associated with defects in cell fusion and infection efficiency404142. For instance, different aminoacid replacements at the same HR1 position in HIV-1 gp41 result in decreased stability, but unaffected or even increased infectivity40. In the case of EIAV (equine infectious anemia virus), destabilized HR1 mutants were found to display different infection phenotypes depending on temperature42. This observation may be extremely interesting in the context of MERS-CoV, as both bats and dromedary camels display adaptive heterothermy (i.e. sensible daily or season variation in body temperature).",

This hypothesis is difficult to address due to the paucity of information concerning the specific MERS-CoV epitopes recognized by human antibodies. Recently, different studies identified human antibodies againts MERS-CoV from non-immune human antibody libraries: all of them were directed against the RBD, suggesting that this region represents a major target for the host immune system43. Nevertheless, data on the humoral immune response to MERS-CoV in infected subjects are presently lacking, whereas such information is richer for SARS-CoV. Indeed, analysis of antibodies derived from a patient who recovered from SARS indicated that some of them recognize epitopes in the HR2 region44. Their neutralizing effect was ascribed to interference of the interaction between HR2 and HR1. Whether antibodies against the S2 region also arise in human subjects (or other mammalian hosts) infected with MERS-CoV and related betaCoVs remains to be determined; if this were the case, some of the selected sites we identified may be under selective pressure to evade recognition.",
