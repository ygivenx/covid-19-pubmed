            "text": "Viral infections are of major concern within the pig production industry, in that they cause not only severe disease but also subclinical infections [1,2] that can have severe economic consequences [3,4]. It is becoming evident that a number of factors, including multiple microorganisms, often act synergistically to create a certain clinical picture. This is particularly evident in, for example, complex respiratory and enteric diseases. Known major respiratory viruses include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine Influenza A virus (swine AIV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV); porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are also believed to be involved [1,2]. It is highly plausible that other viruses could be of importance as well, but they have been overlooked. Some reasons for this could be that diagnostic labs are not searching actively for them, because they are not believed to be involved in respiratory diseases, or because they have not even been discovered yet. Additionally, it is known that the combination of viruses and/or bacteria, as well as different management and environmental factors, are of importance. A viral infection that under certain circumstances does not cause any apparent problems for the infected host can, under other circumstances, have severe consequences. Considering this, it is important not only to identify individual viruses in a host but also to investigate the entire viral community.",

To understand complex diseases and the role that different viruses may or may not play, we need to identify which viruses are circulating in the porcine population regardless of health status. Thereby, we could possibly identify viruses that make up a basal virome at different ages, in different herds, in connection to different health statuses, etc. This knowledge could be used to understand the effects of different viral-coinfections. In pursuit of this goal, we also investigated the virome of specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs.",

In brief, eight tonsils from SPF pigs (Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace) originating from a herd (Serogrisen, Ransta, Sweden) declared free from major swine pathogens [13] were collected. The viruses the SPF pigs were declared free from included swine AIV, PRRSV, PRV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, African swine fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, foot and mouth disease virus, rabies virus, classical swine fever virus, swine vesicular disease virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Similarly, eight tonsils were obtained from conventionally reared pigs from a farrow-to-finish herd with a high prevalence of respiratory lesions (pneumonia and pleuritic) registered in the respiratory tract of the pigs at slaughter. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was known to be present in both herds, but there were no clinical signs of PCV2-associated diseases.

The selection was mainly based on the number of reads and their distribution across the viral genome. For these viruses, reference genomes were downloaded from GenBank, and CLC Genomics Workbench was used to map back the trimmed reads from the different datasets to the reference genome. Using this method, the coverage of the genomes was obtained, and, in the case of complete coverage, the consensus sequence was extracted. In the case of porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7), primers were designed based on the mapped reads to cover the gaps and low coverage regions. The complete PPV7 viral genome was amplified using the KAPA LongRange HotStart PCR Kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the following protocol: 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture of 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 mM of each primer, and 0.625U KAPA LongRange HotStart DNA Polymerase.

The PCR products were purified with the Thermo Fisher PCR purification kit (Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and were sent for sequencing at Macrogen. The sequences were assembled using SeqMan (Lasergene 9, DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA7 [15].

However, for several of them, larger mastadenovirus contigs were produced. In one case, a contig of 11,576 base pairs was identified. For porcine mastadenovirus A, the trimmed HTS reads, from the dataset (S7) with the most adenovirus sequences identified, was mapped back to the most similar porcine adenovirus 3 genome found in the GenBank (AB026117.1) to see if more of the genome could be recovered. However, even with this approach, it was impossible to recover the complete genome, and only approximately 60% coverage was achieved. However, the reads were spread out across the genome and a 90\u2013100% identity on the nucleotide level and 78\u2013100% identity on the amino acid level were observed.

We have previously shown that porcine bocavirus 1 and 3 are present in Sweden [9,14,16]. Therefore, we prioritised to further characterise the PPV7 identified in four of the pigs (two SPF and two conventionally reared pigs), as this virus has not been detected in Europe before, and as many reads were present for this virus in one of the pigs (R4). The metagenomic data from the sample R4 covered 99% of the complete coding region at a sequence depth up to 2480. Together with PCR amplification and sequencing of the missing parts and of low-depth areas, a nucleotide sequence of 4062 bp (accession number MG914435) was obtained. This sequence had two ORFs: one coding for the non-structural protein NS1, and one coding for a putative capsid (Cap) protein. The NS1 gene was 2019 nucleotides in length, coding for a 673 amino acid long protein. NS1 from the Swedish PPV7 had a 93.1\u201394.6% nucleotide sequence identity to the PPV7 NS1 sequences available from the US and China. The ORF coding for Cap was 1401 nucleotides long, yielding a 467 amino acid long protein. For Cap, the nucleotide sequence identity between that of the Swedish PPV7 and those from the US and China was lower (84.7\u201386.8%) than what was seen for NS1. In the 421\u2013552 nucleotide region of the Swedish PPV7 Cap protein, there was high variation compared to the previously characterised PPV7. In this region, both insertions and deletions were observed. The phylogenetic analysis showed that PPV7 from this study grouped with PPV7 from US and China (Figure 1).",

Due to the high amount of teschoviral reads in some of the samples, porcine teschovirus was selected for further genetic analysis. From the two SPF pigs, very few PTV reads were recovered; yet, from two of the conventionally reared pigs (R6 and R7), the complete genome (accession number MH261371-2), including the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR, was obtained when all the trimmed reads were mapped back to one of the most similar teschoviruses available at GenBank. The coverage/sequence depth for R6 was 6\u2013535 and 2\u2013296 for R7. For both the R6 and R7 teschoviral genomes, one open reading frame (6615 nt) coding for the large polyprotein (2205 amino acids) was identified. Sequence analysis showed that the two Swedish teschovirus genomes had, on the nucleotide level, a 99.9% sequence identity. Comparing them to previously described teschoviruses from other parts of the world, the sequence identity varied between 80.0 and 87.1%. The highest similarity was seen between two teschoviruses belonging to serotype 10; in the phylogenetic analysis, the two Swedish teschoviruses grouped together in the same clade as these teschoviruses (Figure 2).",

They often have a multifactorial background and can be associated with a number of different factors such as environment, management, production system, animal genetics, etc., in addition to different pathogens. Major viral pathogens associated with respiratory disease are PRRSV, PRV, and swine AIV, which are all known to induce respiratory disease and lesions. Other viruses such as paramyxovirus (PMV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), PCV2, PRCV, and TTSuV are considered minor pathogens that could play a role through co-infection or in combination with other outer factors [1,2]. In this study, none of the viruses considered major pathogens were detected, which was partly expected, as Sweden has been declared free from PRRSV and PRV. Viruses of minor relevance (TTSuV1 and PCV2) were identified, but only in one pig (R8). In contrast, five SPF pigs were positive for TTSuV1, one of which was also co-infected with TTSuV2.",

The viruses that differed between the two groups were porcine lymphotrophic herpes virus 1, adeno-associated virus, unclassified circovirus, and porcine sapelovirus A and sapovirus, which were only present in conventionally reared pigs, while TTSuV2 only was detected in one SPF pig. The fact that many of the viruses were found in both groups was not surprising, as many studies have shown a high co-infection rate of several viruses in both healthy pigs and in pigs with different disease complexes [14,18,19]. Many respiratory viruses are also known to be ubiquitous in pig populations. It is possible that viral load could play a role in the development of clinical signs, but also that co-infections could have a synergistic effect. For example, enhanced respiratory disease development has been seen in co-infection situations with PRRSV and viruses such as PRCV [20,21], swine AIV [21], and PCV2 [22,23]. The exact mechanisms behind this are not always clear, but it is known that suppression of the immune system and alteration of cytokine responses can be important [24]. Some viruses can also affect macrophage function [25,26]. Considering that different viruses affect the host in different ways, the order that viruses infect their hosts could be important for particular outcomes, hence making them very complicated to study. Furthermore, bacteria are also known to induce respiratory disease, either alone or through viral-bacterial/bacterial-bacterial interactions [1,2]. In addition, migration of parasites through the lungs may also aggravate signs of respiratory diseases.",

For example, adenoviruses were present in all pigs, and 16 out of 18 pigs were positive for picornaviruses. Porcine adenovirus is ubiquitous throughout the world; although the virus has been isolated in connection to disease investigations, it is not considered a major pathogen but rather is believed to often result in subclinical infection [27]. There are three species of porcine adenovirus recognised: porcine mastadenovirus A (porcine adenovirus 1\u20133), porcine mastadenovirus B (porcine adenovirus 4), and porcine mastadenovirus C (porcine adenovirus 5) [28]. Of these, porcine adenovirus 3 and 4 were identified in the different samples from this study. A total of 94% of the pigs were positive for porcine adenovirus 3 and 63% for porcine adenovirus 4. No sequence reads were classified as porcine adenovirus 5. There is a lack of complete genomes of adenoviruses available, making the classification of the reads in this kind of dataset difficult. It is likely, for example, that many of the reads referred to as \u201cother mastadenovirus\u201d in Table 1 could be porcine adenovirus 4 but have been classified as \u201cother mastadenovirus\u201d because only the fibre, pVIII, E1B 55K, and DNA repeat region have been previously sequenced. The dataset may also contain more divergent porcine adenovirus/es that are not classified in any of the present genera.",

The pathogenicity of these viruses is not well known, and they have been detected in both healthy pigs and in pigs suffering from both respiratory and enteric diseases [29]. In our study, there was no major difference in the detection rate of these viruses between the two groups. In four of the samples, an additional parvovirus, porcine parvovirus 7, was identified. This virus was first detected in 2016 from a rectal swab collected from an adult pig in the US and showed a very low identity to any known parvovirus [30]. The virus in that study was detected in different sample types and at a detection rate of 8.6%. Since that first discovery, this virus has also been identified in China [31]. The non-structural protein of the PPV7 characterised in Sweden showed a high degree of similarity (93.1\u201394.6%) to the US and China isolates, while the capsid was more divergent, with a nucleotide identity of 84.7\u201386.8%.

Picornaviruses can cause subclinical infection, as well as diseases ranging from those with mild symptoms such as fever to more severe diseases [32]. In two of the conventionally reared pigs, a high number of teschoviral reads were identified, enabling the assembly of two complete genomes. Porcine teschovirus is endemic in pigs worldwide, and there are 13 known serotypes [28]. Often the infection is subclinical, but PTV-1 is associated with encephalomyelitis (Teschen disease). PTV2, PTV3, and PTV5 have been associated with a milder version called Talfan disease [32]. The viruses identified in these two pigs showed were most similar to PTV-10, which has not been associated with disease, and whether they belong to the serotype 10 remains to be determined.",
