However, PD is progressive and worsens with time, and there is currently no cure; accordingly, it is necessary to treat and care for PD-related symptoms of patients (Elbaz et al., 2016). Therefore, about 40% of PD patients use alternative therapies including acupuncture, tai chi, and herbal medicine to complement their standard treatments (Ghaffari and Kluger, 2014). Indeed, previous studies have shown that herbal formulas, acupuncture and tai chi might be safe and beneficial to PD patients (Bega and Zadikoff, 2014; Cwiekala-Lewis et al., 2017; Lee and Lim, 2017; Noh et al., 2017; Shan et al., 2018).

Patients who were diagnosed with PD during the eligibility period were excluded; therefore, only those newly diagnosed with PD from 2007 to 2011 were included (Figure 1). Patients were divided into two groups by treatment type, an integrative therapy group that received both biomedicine and KM, and a monotherapy group that was only treated with biomedicine.

Dementia in PD patients is a common complication of PD that makes treatment difficult and leads to disability. Depression is also a common complication of PD (Brown and Marsden, 1984; Cummings, 1992), and infectious diseases such as pneumonia are considered factors that increase mortality in PD patients (Pinter et al., 2015). Additionally, patients with a longer duration of PD have more complications and lower quality of life (Ou et al., 2018).

Additionally, the incidence and prevalence of PD in Asian countries, including South Korea, have been shown to be lower than in Europe and America (Pringsheim et al., 2014).

Accordingly, comparative studies with increased duration and number of patients are required to clarify the effects KM on PD. Second, we assessed whether PD and its complications have been well-controlled by alternative outcomes-related measures such as the prevalence of hospitalization and annual length of hospitalization after PD diagnosis. Generally, the outcome of PD recovery or management is evaluated based on the UPDRS, SCOPA, or the PDQ-39. However, the NHIS-NSC does not contain this information because it consists of only health insurance claim data. Third, the number of KM monotherapy patients was very small. In the Korean health insurance system, PD is a serious rare disease that is registered and managed by the government. After PD patients are confirmed and registered 90% of the cost of treatment is supported by the government. In addition to receiving standard drug therapies such as levodopa, registered patients can also concurrently use KM such as herbal formulas and acupuncture if they desire. Therefore, further study is necessary to analyze the total national insurance dataset because the NHIS-NSC, which was used in our study, is equivalent to only 2.2% of the population of the South Korea.",
