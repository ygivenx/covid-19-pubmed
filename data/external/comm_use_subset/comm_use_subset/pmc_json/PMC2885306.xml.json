            "text": "MBL (mannose-binding lectin) is an important component of innate immunity and a central recognition molecule of the lectin pathway of complement, which probably represents the most ancient pathway of complement activation [1]. It binds to an array of carbohydrates such as d-mannose and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine on the surface of pathogens and directly opsonizes the microorganism for phagocytosis or activates the complement system via interaction with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1, -2, -3 and Map19). Complement activation kills the pathogen by the membrane-attack complex or by complement-mediated phagocytosis through increased deposition of opsonic C3 fragments. MBL is also able to recognize altered self structures present on apoptotic cells, promoting their clearance, and to modulate the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines [2,3].",

            "text": "The MBL2 genetic polymorphism is responsible for the very common and widespread variation of circulating levels of MBL oligomers and of functional activity of the protein in the human species. This variation is mainly caused by three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first exon of the gene: MBL2*D (Arg52Cys), *B (Gly54Asp) and *C (Gly57Glu). These mutations have a profound effect on the assembly and stability of the protein, which leads to an increase of low-molecular-mass MBL that has reduced capacity of activating complement and of ligand binding [4,5]. The D, B and C SNPs have been collectively labeled O, whereas the major alleles at these loci have been called A. The concentration of the protein in serum is further modulated by at least three SNPs in the promoter region: MBL2*H,L (located 550 bp before the transcription start site), X, Y (located 221 bp before the transcription start site) and P, Q (non coding SNP located 4 bp after the transcription start site) [6,7]. The combination of structural and promoter polymorphisms results in a dramatic variation in the concentration of high-order MBL oligomers in apparently healthy individuals of up to 1,000-fold (European: range <20-10,000 ng/ml) [8]. Linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs is responsible for only eight haplotypes (as opposed to the 64 theoretically possible) associated with increasingly lower MBL serum concentration: MBL2*HYPA = LYQA = LYPA >LXPA \u226b HYPD = LYPB = LYQC = LYPD [7,9-13]. Using a haplotyping strategy developed by one of us, we recently defined 14 additional allelic haplotypes, most of them similar to LYQA or LYPA [2]. Genotypes carrying two copies of either HYPD, LYPB, LYQC or LYPD or one of them and LXPA are particularly associated with the susceptibility and severity of many diseases, as well as with protection against intracellular infections such as tuberculosis, leprosy and leishmaniasis [14-16].",

            "text": "MBL2 haplotypes identified in this study are listed in Table 1. They were named according to their evolutionary divergence [17] from a hypothetical ancient sequence probably related to LYQA and LYPA [11,18]. According to the nomenclature system we adopted, the first clades to diverge are numbered with Arabic numerals. The 26 identified haplotypes are divided into two major phylogenetic branches by six polymorphisms (P1, Q1 or g.396A >C; P2, Q2 or g.474A >G; P3, Q3 or g.487A >G; P4, Q4 or g.495_500del6; P5, Q5 or g.753C >T, all in strong linkage disequilibrium with the commonly investigated P6, Q6 polymorphism or g.826C >T) (Figure 1). Clade *1 is represented by LYPA and other haplotypes with P variants. Clade *4 is represented by LYQA and other haplotypes with Q variants. Other clades are represented by the intermediate rare haplotypes previously found by our group in Gabon (2 and 3) [2]. Sublineages of each clade are subsequently designated with capital letters (e.g. LYQA-derived haplotypes = *4A and LYQC-derived haplotypes = *4F), and individual present-day haplotypes are given Arabic numerals (e.g. LYQA = *4A1), following the schema numerals/letters/numerals, if they diverge further (e.g. the LYQC-derived haplotype with the g.797C >A SNP, associated with severe malaria = *4F2A). This system is flexible enough for the accommodation of new haplotypes. For example, we added the LYPA-similar haplotypes H16 and H19 found by others exclusively in Pygmy populations [19] as *1K1 and *1L1, and added the HYPG haplotype described by us in another study [16], as 1B4. It is however not suited for recombinant haplotypes. In this case, we chose to call them by the names of the parental haplotypes, separated by a dot. LYPD for example is most probably the product of a recent intragenic recombination event between HYPD (*1B2) and LYPA (*1A1) or LYPB (*1F1) [20]. Since the recombination between HYPD and LYPB would have generated HYPB, which has not been found, we arbitrarily chose to call this haplotype *1A1.1B2 (equivalent to LYPA \u00d7 HYPD). We also wished to incorporate reported associations of haplotypes with MBL concentration. In order to do this, we added a dash followed by small capitalized \"h\" or \"l\" letters, referring to \"high\" or \"low\" MBL levels in serum, respectively (e.g. LYQA = *4A1-h).",

The g.456G >T SNP was assigned by others to an otherwise HYPA haplotype reconstructed from unphased genotypic data of one Sardinian heterozygote [19]. Maximum likelihood phasing of our own data with the EM and ELB algorithms generated 1-2% erroneously assembled haplotypes in the Gabonese and European samples. Only in the Gabonese, seven spurious \"new\" haplotypes were generated with the EM and eleven with the ELB algorithm (Table 3). To verify the effect of sample size in frequency estimates, we compared the haplotype distribution between some populations investigated by us and by others [19]. Although there were no significant differences with the exact population differentiation test, differences between individual haplotype frequencies were significant, even between samples with similar ancestry (Table 2).",

In contrast, HYPA (*1B1-h) and LYPB (*1F1-l) are among the *1 haplotypes that reach high frequencies in the European, Asian and Native American, but not in the African population (Figure 2). The uneven haplotype distribution around the world is reflected by the average Fst value among all segregating sites (0.1831, P < 0.00001), which indicate great genetic differentiation between the analysed populations. One of the lowest individual significant Fst values corresponded to the X/Y SNP, whereas the highest values corresponded to the H, L and P, Q segregating sites (Figure 3). The time to the most recent common ancestor of the MBL2 alleles was inferred at 73,251 years ago [95% CI 5,220 - 214,440]. The mean coalescence time implies that the ancestor of groups *1 and *4 alleles were separated before the modern human dispersal from Africa [21]. The TMRCA of groups *1 and *4 was estimated to be ca. 55,000 years ago, which also indicates that the presence of alleles of African populations in both clades is a result of an ancient ancestry.",

Beyond those described in this work, we recently identified *1B4 in the Euro-Brazilian population. This haplotype is similar to HYPA but with a synonymous substitution in codon 44 (also called HYPG) [16]. To our knowledge, LXPA (*1C1-l) has only one rare similar haplotype (*1C2), identified in one European individual. We also found only one LYPB-similar haplotype (*1F2), but others cite another four [19]. Each occur with frequencies around 2% in Asian/Amerindian groups (Ashkenazi Jewish, Japanese, Chinese and Kaingang), but three were defined by SNPs upstream to the region analysed in this study. The *1H1-h haplotype has a similar global distribution as the commonly investigated haplotypes and is well represented in African, Asian and Amerindian(-derived) populations, being less frequent in European groups. We found a similar haplotype (*1H2-h) once in a Gabonese and once in a Euro-Brazilian individual. All other clade *1 haplotypes are concentrated in African groups. *1E1-h has a rare coding mutation found only once in the Gabonese, as *1G1-h [2]. The *1D1-h haplotype, which we found with 3% frequency in this population, was found by others with comparable frequencies (1.6 - 4.2%) in the Mbuti Pygmy, Nigerian Yoruba and Somali populations [19]. *1J1-h was also found with 1.6% and 0.8% frequencies in Tanzanian Chagga and in the Somali groups, respectively. *2A1-h and *3A1-h are intermediate between P and Q containing haplotypes and most probably reminiscent of the ancient original MBL2 haplotype [2]. The LYQA-similar *4B1-l haplotype carries a coding mutation and was found only once in the Gabonese, as the LYQC-similar haplotype *4F2B-l. In addition to the Gabonese, *4D1-h was found by others with 1.6% frequencies in the Tanzanian Chagga [19]. *4E1-h has a SNP within a glucocorticoid responsive element and seems to be well distributed in Africa, except in the Mbuti and Baka Pygmies [19]. 4F2A-l was formerly found associated with severe malaria [2] and has a similar distribution, except for the fact that it is also present in South-West Asian and European(-derived) groups with 11.9% (Ashkenazi Jewish [19]) to 0.5% (Germans, this work) frequencies. *4F3-l was also found in the Biaka Pygmy (2.1%), Nigerian Yoruba (1.6%) and Tanzanian Chagga (4.7%) groups [19], as well as in Afro-Americans [18] and in one individual of the Kaingang Amerindian population, known to be of mixed ancestry [22].",

The same was true for the H/L and P/Q SNPs (Fst values around 0.2-0.25, compared to published 0.1-0.15, [18]), which indicate that they are good markers for population differentiation. As opposed to these high Fst values, the X/Y SNP presented values lower than 0.05 in this and in another study [18], compatible with global balancing selection.",

In general, the most frequent clade *1 haplotypes are globally distributed, whereas clade *4 haplotypes are more restricted to the African continent. Four of the five most ancient haplotypes also belong to clade *1: *1A1-h, *1B1-h, *1C1-l and *1H1-h. Among them, only *1C1-l (with the X variant) is associated with low (although complement-activating) MBL production. This and the *4A1-h haplotype do not naturally occur in native Aboriginal, Greenlandic and Amerindian populations [11,22,29,30], having probably been lost through bottleneck effects along the migration routes. The other eight polymorph haplotypes (with a frequency higher than 1%) have probably had a more recent origin, being geographically more restricted. Among them, only two are associated with high MBL levels: *1D1-h and *4E1-h. All others generate low MBL levels that, in addition, are greatly restricted in complement activation due to the B, C and D mutations, which occur in critical residues of the collagen-like region (*1B2-l, *1F1-l, *4F1-l, *4F2A-l, *4F3-l and *1F2) (Figure 5). Interestingly, the MBL1P1 pseudogene has been selectively turned off during evolution through the same molecular mechanisms causing the non-functional recent MBL2 haplotypes in man [31]. A more restricted distribution is obviously the case of all haplotypes containing singletons, as well as of *1J1-h, *4D1-h and *4F3-l in Africa, *1A1.1B2-l, *1B2-l and *4C1-h in Europe. They are therefore characteristic of different ethnic groups.",

Of these six segregating sites, probably the most ancient is the g.487G >A variant and the most recent, the g.396A >C variant [2]. Q variants are less widely distributed than P variants, justifying their high Fst values. They are functionally associated with higher promoter activity [6,32] and five of them presented positive, significant Tajima's D values in the Gabonese population. A significant positive value for Tajima's D test indicates an excess of intermediate-frequency variants, as compared with expected frequencies under neutrality, and constitutes evidence of balancing selection (mutations leading to higher MBL levels could have been selectively retained in the ancient human population) or population subdivision. Nevertheless the emergence of several recent mutations as well as genetic drift erased the selective signature at the long haplotype scale, leading to non-significant, although positive, Tajima's D values for the whole haplotype in this and in other studies (eg. Table 4), one of which included 1,166 chromosomes from 24 worldwide populations [18,19,22]. The patterns of MBL2 variation at the large temporal scale would thus have been shaped by stochastic evolutionary factors and therefore be compatible with neutral evolution.",

We examined deviation from neutrality-equilibrium conditions using Tajima's D statistic [43], Fu and Li's D and Fu and Li's F without an outgroup (also known as D* and F*) [44] and Fay and Wu's H [45] tests. Significance was assessed by comparing the observed values to 104 coalescent simulations, conditional on the observed sample size and on the value of S or on the value of \u03b8, assuming a standard neutral model with no recombination. Deletions were excluded from all analyses. To see if deviation from selective neutrality can be found in specific regions of the gene, we also tested the 5' upstream regulatory region (which includes the non-coding P, Q SNP) and the exon 1 coding region separately. The heterogeneity in \u03c0 values and Tajima's D statistic across the sequenced region was also examined by use of the sliding window feature of the DnaSP program. Statistics were calculated for overlapping windows of 60 bp, placed at 15 bp intervals along the sequence. Neutrality tests and sequence diversity parameters were calculated using the DnaSP version 4.10.1 software [46].",

The MEGA 3.1 program was used to construct the phylogenetic maximum parsimony tree with bootstrap test http://www.megasoftware.net/. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of MBL2 was estimated using a relaxed molecular clock approach [48]. Evolutionary rate was modeled by the uncorrelated lognormal distribution and a coalescent prior (Bayesian skyline) was assigned to the tree. The average rate of molecular evolution of the MBL2 gene (1 \u00d7 10-7) was obtained using a theta per site value of 0.0039 calculated for human sequences in DnaSP [46] and the estimate of human effective population size of 10,000 [49]. A normal prior with mean 1 \u00d7 10-7 and standard deviation of 1 \u00d7 10-7 was used for the rate of evolution. Divergence time inference was conducted in BEAST 1.4.8 [50]. In order to obtain the posterior distribution of divergence times, the Markov chain was sampled 50,000 times and 10% of the states were discarded as burn-in.",
