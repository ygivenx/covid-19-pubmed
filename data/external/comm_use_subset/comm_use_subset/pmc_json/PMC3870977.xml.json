The invasion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in the human body can change the expression of TB-associated proteins and release these proteins into the bloodstream through different pathways. Detection of serum antibodies in TB patients is precisely based on this principle [6]. However, as the TB antigens are varied and complex, the antibodies in TB patients may show a great variety. As a biomarker, not a single antigen can be recognized in the serum of all or most TB patients, and therefore a high sensitivity and specificity cannot be achieved [7]. The emergence of proteomics technology makes the analysis of all the proteins in the serum possible. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), as a powerful proteomics technology integrating the technologies of chips/magnetic beads and mass spectrometry, can be directly used to detect crude body fluid samples without any labeling. This technology is simple, fast with high-throughput and high sensitivity [8,9]. Many protein biomarkers of certain diseases have been indicated by using SELDI-TOF MS to analyze the serum proteome [10-13].",

Peak labeling was performed by Biomarker Wizard software, version 3.1 (Ciphergen Biosystems). A two-sample t-test was used to compare mean normalized intensities between the case and control groups. Proteins with low P-values were selected, and the intensities of the selected peaks were transferred to Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS, Ciphergen Biosystems) to construct the classification tree of TB. Briefly, the intensities of the selected peaks were submitted to BPS as a \u201cRoot node\u201d. Based on peak intensity, a threshold was determined by BPS to classify the root node into two child nodes. A sample would be labeled as \u201cleft-side child node\u201d if the peak intensity of a blind sample was lower than or equal to the threshold. Meanwhile, if the peak intensities higher than the threshold, it would be marked as \u201cright-side child node\u201d. After rounds of decision-making, the training set was found to be discriminatory with the least error. All protein peak intensities of samples in the test set were evaluated by BPS using the classification model. The TB and control samples were then discriminated based on their proteomic profile characteristics. The sensitivity was defined as the probability of predicting TB cases, and the specificity was defined as the probability of predicting control samples. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of correct state classifications.",

The detailed characteristics of the TB group are shown in Table 1. All TB patients showed different changes as inflammation, opacities, fibrosis and cavities in chest X-ray. Sputum culture for patients with TB was positive in 209 (65%) subjects with bacteriological analysis upon their first visit to hospital. For patients with negative sputum culture, the pathogens were identified in 49 (14.9%) patients with TB by brush biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and biopsy of diseased pulmonary segment under fiberoptic bronchoscope. Typical histopathological changes of TB were identified in 7 (2.1%) patients with TB by percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy. After the comprehensive diagnosis, such as combining clinical symptoms (fever, cough, expectoration, hemoptysis), radiological changes on chest X-rays, anti-tuberculosis antibody detection and molecular biological techniques to detect pathogen-specific sequence, 58 (18.0%) patients with TB received anti-tuberculosis treatment, and were confirmed based on treatment response. All TB patients involved in the study were followed up for one year to confirm the reliability of the results.",

Although both are weakly cationic, as a new protein separation technology, the WCX magnetic beads provide a great flexibility for fractionation of complex biological samples. It has been successfully used in the separation and purification of various proteins in the body fluids such as serum, plasma and amniotic fluid [20-22]. During the pilot study, we compared the SELDI spectra of the serum in TB patients by WCX magnetic beads and CM10 protein chips. The results showed that the WCX magnetic beads could screen more proteins from serum samples of TB patients, with higher accuracy of the protein peaks and had stronger ability of protein capturing (Figure 1).

The activated fibrinogenase in the fibrinolytic system enters into the blood in large quantity, which will cause the increase of FDP in serum. This is part of the body\u2019s defense function [24,25]. Robson et al.[23] reported an increase in FDP levels, concurrent with elevated levels of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant and its production rate may increase greatly as a result of various essentially non-specific stimuli [26-28]. Turken et al. [29], in a study of the hemostatic changes in active pulmonary TB, found that elevated plasma fibrinogen levels appear to induce a hypercoagulable state. Others also reported significantly higher levels of plasma fibrinogen in Nigeria pulmonary TB patients [30]. Similarly, in our study, analysis in 142 patients with TB showed increased plasma fibrinogen levels (5.45 \u00b1 1.65 g/L). It has been postulated that the vascular endothelium could be primed as a result of interaction between mycobacterial products and the host monocyte-macrophage system, which then synthesis large amounts of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6. These cytokines induce hepatic acute-phase responses that alter the levels of coagulation proteins such as fibrinogen [29,31,32].",

Bacteria can also exploit the molecules of the fibrinolytic system to avoid the innate immune response, and the fibrinolytic system itself can modulate the inflammatory response induced by the pathogen [33,34]. MTB has been demonstrated to have high number of Plg receptors, which can be activated to Plm by host activators, suggesting that this interaction could have a role in host-bacteria relationship [34,35]. Therefore, we speculate that activation of the fibrinolytic system is closely associated with the onset and progress of TB.",

In addition to the technical methods and the statistical discrepancy, the lack of a gold standard diagnosis in 100% of the cases is clearly a limitation of our study. Only 65% of TB cases were culture positive proven cases, and a minority of culture negative cases may not have TB. Although the patients with negative sputum culture were diagnosed based on comprehensive combined clinical and radiological findings, and TB treatment outcomes, but there may be other pulmonary infectious diseases which may mimic pulmonary TB.",
