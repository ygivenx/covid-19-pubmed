            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is widely distributed throughout the world. At least 350 million people are HBV carriers and are at high risk for developing hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Strong and polyclonal CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are essential for the clearance of HBV infections from the liver[2]; therefore, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may have a potential high risk for HBV infection due to the lack of adequate immunity. HBV reactivation under immunosuppressive therapy occurs frequently in patients with chronic and resolved HBV infection and is rarely reported in HBV seronegative patients [3]. HBV recurrence after liver transplantation occurs in 80\u2013100% of patients without any prevention, while only occurring in up to 6.1% of patients after prophylactic treatment using hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs) [4]. Although HBIG, NAs, and the hepatitis B vaccine are effective for preventing and treating HBV reactivation and recurrence, many factors remain unresolved. For example, patients under immunosuppressive therapy have poor response rates to the hepatitis B vaccine [5], [6], and the strategies for the prophylaxis and treatment of HBV reactivation and recurrence should be optimized. Detailed analysis of the HBV infection under immunosuppression is essential for resolving the above-mentioned problems.",

Given that HI of pAAV/HBV1.2 in BALB/c mice leads to transient HBV replication and gene expression in the liver [8], [9], this system could be used to analyze the influence of the immunosuppressive agents on HBV replication. Four widely used immunosuppressive drugs were selected: 1) corticoid: dexamethasone (DEX), 2) calcineurin inhibitor: cyclosporine A (CsA), 3) alkylating agents: cyclophosphamide (CYP), and 4) antimetabolite: mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Using the immune competent mouse model after HBV HI, we demonstrated that HBV replication under immunosuppressive therapy was extended by the treatment with immunosuppressive agents and that transient treatment with CsA and CYP led to long-term HBV persistence with a high level of viral replication. Notably, the mRNA levels of the T cell markers and cytokine expression in the liver were significantly suppressed by CsA treatment and were restored by the early withdrawal of CsA, indicating that an impaired immunological function in the hepatic compartment leads to HBV persistence. Furthermore, adoptive immune transfer led to HBV suppression.",

Thus, the intrahepatic mRNA levels of the T cell markers (e.g., CD3 and CD8), the antiviral cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1]), and the cytotoxic molecules (e.g., Fas ligand [Fas-L] and perforin) were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (Fig. 4). We first analyzed the dynamic changes of these molecules in the livers from saline-treated mice. The results revealed that the levels of CD3, CD8, IFN-\u03b3, Fas-L, and perforin were significantly elevated at w2 (accompanied by the decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in the serum) and that the virus was ultimately eliminated at w3 from both the serum and the liver (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, we compared the expression of these molecules in the livers from the mice receiving saline or CsA at w2 and w7, which were the time points with decreased HBV replication in the saline-treated mice or the CsA-4w mice. At w2, all the molecules elevated in the saline-treated mice were suppressed in the CsA-treated mice, while only the decline of CD3 and perforin were statistically significant (Fig. 4B). At w7, the discontinuation of the CsA treatment at w4 led to a significant increase in the levels of CD3, CD8, TNF-\u03b1, and perforin, coincident with the declined HBV replication at w7 and HBV clearance at w10 (Fig. 4B).",

Therefore, we asked whether the long-term HBV persistence induced by transient CsA treatment could be terminated by the adoptive immune transfer. Three groups of mice received CsA treatment for 10 weeks post HI. At w12, the mice received splenocytes from na\u00efve mice (Na\u00efve) or mice immunized with the HBcAg expression plasmid pHBc (Immune) or were left as controls (Control) (Fig. 5A). The transfer of splenocytes from the immune mice led to a significant decrease in the levels of serum HBsAg and liver HBcAg and enhanced the HBcAb responses and the cellular responses to HBcAg in the recipient mice (Fig. 5B, 5D, 5E, and 5F), whereas HBsAb was remained undetectable in the recipient mice (Fig. 5C). Serum HBsAg and liver HBcAg were persistently detected in the control and na\u00efve mice (Fig. 5B and 5E). All the mice in the control and na\u00efve groups (except for one na\u00efve mouse) remained negative for HBsAb (Fig. 5C).

HBV replication was not eliminated in the immunosuppressant-treated mice and was maintained at a high level in mice treated with DEX, CsA, and CYP, but not with MMF, although the mice receiving the same regimen of DEX, CsA, CYP, and MMF treatment exhibited a comparable, extended survival time of the skin grafts (Fig. S2). After the withdrawal of immunosuppressant treatment, HBV was persistent at a high level in the CsA- and CYP-treated mice, and at a low level in the DEX-treated mice. Furthermore, the early (at w4 post HI) withdrawal of the CsA treatment restored the suppressed intrahepatic CD8 T cell response and led to subsequent HBV clearance. Finally, adoptive transfer with the splenocytes from donor mice immunized with HBcAg expression plasmid led to HBV suppression in these HBV-persistent mice.",

In addition, this is comparable with the situation of HBV reactivation during organ transplantation or chemotherapy, although any form of immunosuppressive treatment can result in HBV reactivation, certain drugs are associated with a higher risk than others are, e.g., steroids are most frequently associated with HBV reactivation [23]. This may be associated with the different effects on the virus-specific T cell response, e.g. tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, was potent in inhibiting CMV-specific Th1 cytokines, whereas MMF preferentially inhibited CMV-specific Th2 cytokines [24]. Furthermore, MMF was recently found to inhibit the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (resulting the decrease of intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotide pools) and to augment interferon-stimulated gene expression[25]. These properties of MMF may also contribute to the reduction of HBV DNA in MMF-treated mice.",

Recently, several studies have attempted to evaluate the impact of the minimization and complete withdrawal of immunosuppressants in liver transplantation [26]. The immunosuppressants were successfully discontinued in approximately 20% of carefully selected recipients (e.g., those with a longer duration after the transplantation), indicating that long-term immunosuppression led to tolerance against the transplanted liver. Interestingly, in the present study, the discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment did not always result in the restoration of immunological functions and subsequent HBV clearance, which may also suggest that immunosuppressive treatment using the selected drugs for a sufficient length of time causes tolerance against HBV.",

The frequencies of HBV-specific CD8 T cells were generally extremely low in Balb/C mice that received an HI of pAAV/HBV1.2 and could not be properly measured by intracellular staining and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. S3). Therefore, we analyzed the intrahepatic mRNA expression of the molecules closely related to the CD8 T cell immune response, including the T cell markers (e.g., CD3 and CD8), the antiviral cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1), and the cytotoxic molecules (e.g., Fas-L and perforin). The expression of CD3, CD8, IFN-\u03b3, and perforin was increased after the HBV transfection, accompanied by a decrease in the HBV replication and the subsequent HBV clearance, which was consistent with the findings in the woodchuck liver with acute woodchuck hepatitis virus infection [28]. Although IFN-\u03b3 and perforin can also be produced by NK cells, NK-cell depletion by an anti-asialo antibody could not prolong the HBV replication in these immunocompetent mice (data not shown), indicating that the HBV clearance in these immunocompetent mice was mainly mediated by IFN-\u03b3- and perforin-dependent CD8 T cell responses. This result is not completely consistent with a previous study using knockout mice deficient in the numerous cellular or molecular effectors. Using the knockout mice, those researchers found that CD8 T cells mediated HBV clearance in a Fas-dependent but perforin-independent manner [29]. CsA treatment extended the HBV replication and suppressed the intrahepatic expression of CD3, CD8, IFN-\u03b3, and perforin; moreover, early CsA withdrawal restored the intrahepatic expression of CD3, CD8, TNF-\u03b1, and perforin and led to HBV clearance from the liver, thereby providing more evidence regarding CD8 T cell response-mediated HBV clearance in this immunocompetent mice model. It should be noted that the alteration of the mRNA expression may be a result of different events including the general systemic reduction of T cell responses, reduced liver-infiltration of specific T cells, the different cell proliferation status in the liver, and the alteration of the expression profiles at the single cell level.",

These findings may be helpful for individualized treatment with immunosuppressive drugs in patients at high risk for HBV reactivation and recurrence. For this purpose, other immunosuppressive agents, such as tacrolimus and rapamycin, must also be evaluated in this system. We also demonstrated that an impaired intrahepatic CD8 T cell response may be responsible for HBV persistence under immunosuppression and that the restoration of the T cell response leads to HBV clearance or suppression in this HBV-persistent mouse model, thereby mimicking the HBV infection in humans. Therefore, an HBV mouse model based on HI is suitable for studying the HBV infection under immune suppression and for evaluating and optimizing the approaches for the prophylaxis and treatment of HBV reactivation and recurrence under immunosuppressive therapy.",
