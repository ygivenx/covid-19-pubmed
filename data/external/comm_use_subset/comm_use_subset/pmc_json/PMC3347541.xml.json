In its simplest form, a\nDNA\u2013vaccine is a plasmid containing a gene of the pathogenic protein and the elements\nneeded to transcribe this gene in mammalian cells. This DNA is introduced into mammalian cells\nduring immunization. It is then transcribed, and the encoded antigen is synthesized initiating\nan immune response (Fig. 1). Unlike protein\u2013based vaccines,\nDNA\u2013vaccines based on microbial genes and tumor antigens have the advantage of synthesizing the\nspecific antigen in the host\u2019s organism, where it is processed correctly to induce an immune\nresponse of the desired specificity. This approach is promising because of the simplicity and low cost\nof the production and transportation of DNA\u2013vaccines as compared to the traditional vaccines.\nMoreover, gene engineering allows an easy modification of DNA\u2013immunogens; new antigens\ncan be designed with properties predicted by  in silico  studies. The use of\nDNA\u2013vaccines causes some anxiety because of the possibility that the genetic material\ngets inserted into the host genome (insertional mutagenesis). However, the probability of this\nevent is extremely low. It is in the range of around 1\u20137 insertions per 150,000 nuclei,\nwhich is lower than the rate of the natural insertion mutation by a factor of 1,000 [1].\n",

Series of trials of\nprophylactic and therapeutic DNA\u2013vaccines against various human pathogens, including\nHIV\u20131 and HCV, have been performed [5\u20137]. However, the immunogenicity\nof genetic vaccines needs improvement, especially for human applications [8\u201310]. Various approaches are\nbeing used in order to increase the efficiency of DNA\u2013vaccines [11\u201313]. They include the\ndevelopment of novel methods of DNA\u2013vaccine administration (electroporation has become\nincreasingly popular in the recent years); supplementing vaccine formulation with cytokines\nand/or chemokines or their genes [14] ; optimizing\nplasmid vectors by selecting more effective gene promoters and regulatory elements [15] ; and modulating plasmid CpG content [14]. The DNA\u2013immunogen is also modified: the coding\nsequence of immunogen is often changed to increase the expression [16]. One of the most promising approaches for modifying the immunogen is to\nalter its processing and presentation pathway [17]. Such\nre\u2013direction can be achieved by \u201clabeling\u201d the protein with specialized\nsignal sequences.\n",

In order to be recognized by the immune system, an\nantigen must be processed and presented on the surface of a cell by the molecules of the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC). There are two main classes of these molecules: MHC class I\n(MHC\u2013I) and MHC class II (MHC\u2013II). In order to bind to the molecules of either\nclass, the protein encoded by DNA\u2013immunogen must go through antigen processing in the\nspecialized cell compartments (Table 1). Endogenous proteins are degraded in the proteasome and\nare presented in a complex with \u041c\u041d\u0421 \u2013I on the cell surface, where they\ncan be recognized by the receptors of cytotoxic CD8+ T\u2013cells (CTL), which then initiate a\ncytotoxic immune response [18].

This (re)direction can be achieved by cloning an\nUb\u2013encoding sequence onto the 5 \u00b4 \u2013terminus of the target gene and\nadding a destabilizing N\u2013terminal residue after the Ub, which makes an\nantigen a better proteasome substrate.

The HIV\u20131 nef was modified in this\nway to generate a Ub\u2013Arg\u2013Nef, which led to the improved\nimmunogenicity of nef in mice [29]. Fusion with\nubiquitin was used for immunization with HIV\u20131 gene expression libraries. All of the ORFs\n(open reading frames) of HIV\u20131 encoded by 32 plasmids were modified by the addition of an\nubiquitin encoding sequence. After a single immunization using gene gun, this library\nstimulated a strong T\u2013cell response against all 32 antigens. This response was registered\nas an enhanced CTL\u2013activity, IFN\u2013 \u03b3 + production by CD8+ T\u2013cells and\nHLA\u2013tetramer binding [30].

An increase in the Th2\u2013type immune\nresponse of CD4+ \u0422 \u2013cells in response to the LAMP\u20131 fusions\nwas shown after immunization with DNA encoding LAMP\u20131 fusions of\nHIV\u20131 gp160\u2013 and p55gag [68, 69].

Another successfully redirected cytoplasmic protein was the nucleocapsid\nprotein of the coronavirus SARS (sarsN). Immunization of mice with DNA\nencoding the LAMP\u20131\u2013sarsN chimera led to a balanced specific\nIFN\u2013\u03b3 and IL\u20134 production and strong CTL\u2013response against\nsarsN [66].

A strong\nimmune response of the mixed Th1/Th2\u2013type was raised both against the wild and\ndrug\u2013resistant HIV\u20131 reverse transcriptases, circumventing tolerance of the immune\nsystem towards this conserved retroviral antigen [71].\n",

This confirms that\nautophagy constantly and effectively directs cytoplasmic proteins into presentation via the MHC\nclass II pathway, where they can be used to stimulate a \u0422 \u2013helper response.\n",

Fusion of HIV\u20131 Gag and E\nproteins to the secretory chemokine MCP3 directed these viral proteins into the secretory\npathway. Chimeric genes induced an effective production of anti\u2013HIV\u20131 antibodies in\nmacaques. Macaques immunized with the chimeras and infected with a pathogenic SIVmac251 had\nlower viral loads than the infected na \u00ef ve animals [83]. This is an example of the conversion of an endogenous antigen into the\nexogenous, for further capture by endocytosis and transfer to the lysosomes. This pathway, as\nwell as the endogenous lysosome (re)targeting, enhances antigen presentation in complex with\nthe MHC class II molecules and can considerably increase the immunogenicity of\nDNA\u2013vaccines.\n",

DNA\u2013vaccine\ntechnology opens a wide range of possibilities for creating effective vaccines, one such is\nthrough immunogen (re)targeting. In this paper, we reviewed a number of signal sequences that\ncan be introduced into the immunogens to direct them into a predetermined processing and\npresentation pathway, usually different from the one they would naturally take. Direction of an\nantigen into the MHC\u2013I presentation pathway would enhance the cytotoxic \u0422\n\u2013cell response, while direction onto the MHC\u2013II pathway would activate\nT\u2013helper cells and stimulate both cellular and humoral responses. Overall, the use of\nsignal sequences to control and guide immunogen presentation can increase the immunogenic\npotential of the existing DNA\u2013immunogens and help to create new effective prophylactic\nand therapeutic vaccines for diverse human applications.\n",
