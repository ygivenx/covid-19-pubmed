            "text": "The emergence and resurgence of human viral pathogens can be traced to a complex variety of causes including increased urbanization, human contact with animal reservoirs, a decrease in effective public health systems, and the spread of insect vectors that disseminate some viral infections [1], [2], [3]. Flaviviruses are a genus in the Flaviviridae family and include important emerging and resurgent human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and yellow fever virus [2], [4]. Flaviviruses are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, and can cause severe human diseases characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, and hemorrhages [2], [3]. More than one third of the world's population lives in dengue fever endemic areas, and there are an estimated 50\u2013100 million cases of dengue infection and 500,000 cases of the more lethal complication, dengue hemorrhagic fever, per year [5], [6], [7], [8]. There are currently no antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. DENV vaccine development is underway but is problematic due to the presence of four DENV serotypes and the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [2], [6], [9], [10]. Antiviral therapies could thus be an important alternative for DENV and for viruses such as WNV in which the cost and potential side effects of vaccination must be weighed against the relatively low number of human cases [2].",

            "text": "Flaviviruses are small, highly organized enveloped viruses with a spherical shape [4], [11]. They contain a positive-sense RNA genome packaged by the viral capsid protein. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the viral membrane protein E. Flaviviruses infect cells by receptor engagement at the plasma membrane, endocytic uptake, and a membrane fusion reaction triggered by the low pH of the endosome compartment [12], [13]. The viral E protein binds the receptor and drives the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes to initiate virus infection. The pre-fusion structure of the E protein ectodomain (here referred to as E\u2032) shows that E contains three domains composed primarily of \u03b2-sheets: a central domain I (DI) connecting on one side to the elongated domain II (DII) with the hydrophobic fusion loop at its tip, and connecting via a flexible linker on the other side to the immunoglobulin-like domain III (DIII) [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] (Figs. 1A, S1). Although these regions are not present in the truncated E\u2032 ectodomain, DIII connects to a stem domain and C-terminal membrane anchor (TM). The E protein in mature infectious flavivirus is organized in homodimers that lie tangential to the virus membrane [20]. Within each dimer the E proteins interact in a head to tail fashion, with the fusion loop of each E protein hidden in a hydrophobic pocket formed by DI and DIII of the dimeric E partner.",

This reaction involves low pH-triggered dissociation of the homodimer, fusion loop insertion into the endosome membrane, formation of a core trimer composed of DI and DII, and the foldback of the DIII and stem regions towards the target membrane and their packing against the core trimer. The prefusion and postfusion conformations of the flavivirus E fusion protein are structurally and functionally similar to those of the E1 fusion protein from the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [23], [24], [25], and these fusion proteins are often referred to as \u201cclass II\u201d [26], [27], [28]. In addition to the ectodomains whose trimer structures are described above, truncated fusion proteins composed of domains I and II (DI/II) can reconstitute SFV and DENV core trimer formation on target membranes [29], [30]. Such core trimers act as specific targets for DIII binding, thus recapitulating the protein-protein interactions during class II trimerization and hairpin formation.",

Given the low pH that is present in the Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network (TGN) [31], how do flaviviruses avoid inactivation during their transport? The particles are assembled in the ER as immature non-infectious viruses containing heterodimers of the precursor membrane protein (prM) and E protein [4], [26], [32]. Subsequent exposure to low pH in the secretory pathway triggers a dramatic rearrangement to E homodimers and makes the prM protein accessible to furin cleavage [33], [34]. Processing of prM by cellular furin results in mature infectious virus in which E homodimers are poised to mediate fusion [33]. Important recent studies describe the structure of pr peptide in complex with E, and indicate that processed pr remains associated with the virus at low pH and can inhibit virus-membrane interaction [34], [35], [36]. Thus, pr on the virus could protect E protein from low pH in the secretory pathway.",

We generated a construct based on residues 1\u201386 of DENV2 prM, truncating pr just before the start of the furin cleavage recognition site at residue 87 (Fig. 1A). This sequence was linked to a mammalian signal peptide at the N-terminus and to an affinity tag at the C-terminus, and expressed in 293T cells. The protein was isolated in a highly purified form by affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 1B), and was recognized by mAb prM-6.1 against prM [40] (data not shown). The pr peptide migrated at a position of \u223c17 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE, in keeping with its predicted size of 13 kDa plus the presence of carbohydrate due to the glycosylation site at position 69. This carbohydrate was removed by Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to give a peptide of the predicted size. The protein was largely resistant to Endoglyosidase H (Endo H) digestion, indicating maturation of the carbohydrate chain as the protein transited through the Golgi complex. A mobility shift was observed upon reduction of pr, in keeping with the presence of 3 disulfide bonds in the structure of pr [34].",

Compared to the pull-down assay, SPR can detect low levels of protein-protein interactions as binding is detected in real time and does not require removal of unbound E. The E\u2032 protein is a dimer at neutral pH and dissociates to monomers at low pH [30]. When SPR was performed with E\u2032 protein buffered at pH 8.0 there was very low binding (low signal response) (Fig. 2B). As the buffer pH was decreased, the signal gradually increased, with maximal response observed at \u223cpH 6.25 and no further increase at pH 6.0. A rapid decrease in signal was observed when the samples were shifted to protein-free buffer, indicating rapid dissociation of the pr-E interaction. Similar results were obtained using monomeric DI/II, with the lowest binding at pH 8.0, highest binding at pH 6.25, and a slight decrease at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the dimeric E\u2032 and monomeric E DI/II proteins bound pr peptide with similar pH-dependence. Binding to pr was specific, as little interaction was observed using the structurally similar E1 DI/II protein of SFV (Fig. 2D). In addition, binding of DENV E DI/II protein to pr was inhibited by preincubation with mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop (molar ratio 1\u22361) (data not shown). Determination of the affinity of pr-E binding was not performed as the data did not fit to a simple Langmuir model of 1\u22361 binding, presumably because of E protein aggregation at low pH.",

Structural considerations suggested that this inhibition occurs primarily by blocking low pH-triggered dissociation of the E dimer, a required first step in the fusion reaction. To test this mechanism, we evaluated the effect of pr on the membrane interactions of dimeric and monomeric forms of E protein. The E\u2032 dimer was preincubated with pr peptide or an unrelated protein with the same affinity tag for 5 min at pH 8.0, and then treated at pH 5.75 in the presence of target liposomes. Membrane-associated proteins were separated by liposome floatation on sucrose gradients. There was no liposome co-floatation when E\u2032 protein was incubated with liposomes at neutral pH (Fig. 3A). About 70% of the total E\u2032 floated with liposomes in the top part of the sucrose gradient after treatment at pH 5.75 in the presence (Fig. 3A, top panel) or absence (data not shown) of a control protein. In contrast, when E\u2032 was preincubated with pr peptide (pr\u2236E\u2032 molar ratio 12\u22361) and treated with low pH, only \u223c2% of E\u2032-ST floated with the liposomes (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Inhibition by pr was not observed when it was added after E\u2032 was treated at low pH in the presence of liposomes for 30 min (Fig. 3A, bottom panel), and thus pr needed to be present during the membrane insertion step. Inhibition was concentration-dependent, with 22% E\u2032 co-floatation at a pr\u2236E\u2032 molar ratio of 3\u22361, 8% at 6\u22361, and 0.4% for 24\u22361 (data not shown; see also Fig. 3E).",

In order to test the ability of exogenous pr peptide to interact with and inhibit intact DENV, we took advantage of a previously described assay that monitors low pH-triggered fusion of DENV with cells [41]. In this fusion-infection assay, virus is pre-bound to target cells on ice, and then treated at 37\u00b0C for 1 min at low pH to trigger virus fusion with the plasma membrane. This fusion reaction is then quantitated by detecting the infected cells by immunofluorescence. We tested the effect of pr peptide during this 1 min low pH treatment using DENV1 WP and DENV2 NGC. The sequence of E DI/II is 68% identical between these two serotypes. Both serotypes showed efficient fusion and infection after treatment at pH 6.0, with about a 10-fold increase compared to samples treated at pH 7.9 (Fig. 4). The addition of pr peptide during the 1 min low pH treatment strongly inhibited DENV fusion and infection. Inhibition was dose-dependent, with 45\u201349% inhibition at 6 \u00b5M pr and 81\u201385-% inhibition at 30 \u00b5M pr. In contrast, pr did not inhibit low pH-triggered fusion by the alphavirus SIN (Fig. 4). Thus, exogenous DENV2 pr peptide can specifically interact with mature DENV1 and DENV2 to block virus fusion and infection. We did not observe inhibition when DENV was preincubated with 30 \u00b5M pr at pH 7.0 and then added to target cells in a standard infection assay, suggesting that under these conditions an inhibitory concentration of pr was not present during low pH-triggered fusion reaction in the endosome. This result also indicates that the presence of pr did not affect virus-cell binding.",

Sequence analysis shows that these 11 residues (Fig. 5A, numbered residues) are highly conserved among the 4 DENV serotypes, and that D63 and D65 of pr, and the complementary H244 on E protein are conserved among all reported flavivirus sequences [34]. Optimal pr-E binding in vitro occurred at \u223cpH 6.25 (Fig. 2), suggesting that protonation of H244 could be involved in this pH-dependence.

In contrast, almost no H244A DI/II protein was pulled-down by pr-sepharose at either low pH or neural pH (Fig. 5B). SPR analysis of WT DI/II protein showed most efficient binding at pH 6.0, and binding was blocked by pre-incubating the DI/II protein with mAb 4G2 (molar ratio 1\u22361) before dilution into SPR buffer (Fig. 5C, upper panel). Equivalent concentrations of H244A DI/II protein showed greatly reduced binding to pr compared to that of WT protein (Fig. 5C, lower panel). Although H244A binding was decreased, the residual binding was still blocked by mAb 4G2 and had an acidic pH optimum.

This agrees with previous studies indicating lethal effects of an H244A mutation on DENV2 [43].",

Efficient DENV particle production is dependent on E protein folding, particle budding into the ER, and subsequent particle egress through the secretory pathway. To investigate these issues, we took advantage of the ability of the flavivirus prM and E proteins to assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) in the absence of other viral components or virus infection [44], [45], [46]. The VLP system avoids complications arising from selection of revertants of deleterious virus mutations such as H244A. Flavivirus VLP bud into the ER in the immature prM form, undergo furin maturation during transport through the secretory pathway, and display similar low pH-dependent fusion activity as infectious virions [44], [47]. The VLP system has been used extensively to follow the process of flavivirus particle production and the role of prM in this process [37], [44], [45], [48].",

After 36 h induction with tetracycline, both WT and H244A cells show abundant intracellular expression of the DENV1 E protein as detected by immunofluorescence, while the parent cell line is negative for E expression (Fig. 8A). To evaluate whether WT and H244A E proteins were correctly folded, cells were induced for 36 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to E DIII, and with two conformation-specific mAbs. mAb 4E11 recognizes a discontinuous epitope on DENV E DIII and requires proper DIII disulfide bond formation for recognition [49], [50]. mAb 4G2 recognizes the fusion loop at the tip of flavivirus E DII and its epitope is sensitive to reduction [51]. Expression studies have shown that the 4G2 epitope is not formed if the E protein is expressed in the absence of prM [52], indicating that this epitope is particularly useful for diagnostic tests of prM's chaperone interaction with E (see also reference [37]). As shown in Fig. 8B, lysates from cells induced to express prM plus WT or H244A E proteins showed strong reactivity with all three antibodies. Quantitation of multiple experiments confirmed that WT and H244A E proteins were comparably recognized by the 4E11 and 4G2 mAbs. Thus, by these criteria H244A E protein interacts with prM protein and is correctly folded. This result also agrees with our finding that truncated H244A E protein expressed with prM in the S2 cell system was fully active in low pH-dependent membrane binding and trimerization, suggesting correct folding (Fig. 6).",

The cells were then lysed and the E proteins immunoprecipitated, and the VLP in the culture media were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Analysis by western blotting showed strong E protein expression in both WT and H244A cells, and no expression in the parent cells (Fig. 8C). The WT cells released E protein in VLP, but VLP release from cells expressing the H244A mutant E protein was greatly reduced (Fig. 8C, - media samples). This result is in keeping with the hypothesis that the H244A cells assemble VLP in the neutral pH environment of the ER but that VLP release is inhibited by the lack of pr protection from the low pH of the secretory pathway. To test this idea, we induced WT and H244A prM-E expression and cultured the cells in the presence of 20 mM NH4Cl to neutralize the acidic pH in the Golgi and TGN compartments (Fig. 8C, +NH4Cl lanes). The cellular expression level of either E protein was not significantly affected by NH4Cl treatment, and WT VLP production was similar in NH4Cl-treated cells and untreated cells. However, production of VLP containing the H244A mutant E protein was increased 4\u20137 fold in NH4Cl-treated cells. While H244A VLP production was still significantly decreased compared to that of WT, it was selectively rescued by NH4Cl treatment.",

In situ measurements indicate that the pH of the TGN is \u223c6 [53], while the pH optimum of DENV2 NGC fusion is \u223c6.2 [41]. The low pH of the TGN is critical for the rearrangement of immature DENV to allow furin cleavage, but once the virus is processed it becomes fusion-active in this same pH range. Thus the pH dependence of the pr-E interaction appears optimized to protect DENV during its continued transit through the secretory pathway. Pr's inhibition of E membrane insertion was less efficient at a pH value (pH 5.0) similar to that in the late endocytic pathway (Fig. 3D\u2013E). This loss of pr inhibition at more acidic pH could help to explain the recent finding that infection by immature DENV is enhanced by antibodies to prM [42]. The antibody-bound immature virus is likely to be endocytosed and processed by cellular furin in the endocytic pathway [54]. The lower pH conditions of the late endocytic pathway could then cause the loss of pr inhibition and allow virus fusion.",

This suggested that pr might primarily block virus-membrane interaction by preventing dissociation of E dimers, a required first step in the fusion pathway [55]. Our results show efficient binding of pr to the dimeric form of the DENV E protein, but also to the monomeric DI/II form. We do not know if the E\u2032 protein dimer is stabilized by pr interaction or if the dimer dissociates prior to interaction with pr, and experiments to address these points were inconclusive (data not shown). The similar pH dependence of pr binding to monomeric and dimeric E proteins suggests that pr may bind the same site in both cases. mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop inhibited pr interaction with E DI/II, confirming that pr was binding to the DII tip rather than to other sites on expressed E proteins. In keeping with its binding site in the vicinity of the fusion loop, pr peptide blocked the membrane insertion and liposome co-floatation of E\u2032 and DI/II proteins. Prior studies showed that a monomeric DI/II protein with a single Strep affinity tag stably inserts into liposomes at either neutral or low pH [30], and pr blocked this insertion even at pH 8.0 where its interaction with DI/II was suboptimal (data not shown). Thus, while the pr-E interaction is strongly low pH-dependent, its functional inhibition of membrane insertion can still be observed at neutral pH in the presence of excess pr.",

Experiments in TBEV evaluated particle production and membrane fusion activity using a VLP system [56]. Mutation of H248 (TBE numbering) to A or I blocks VLP secretion, in agreement with our results. However, an H248N mutant efficiently produces VLP, and these particles show WT levels of fusion activity. WNV E H246A or Q mutations inhibit release of infectious reporter virus particles from cells, as do a number of other substitutions at this position [57]. Replacement of H246 with aromatic residues such as phenylalanine allows both particle release and infectivity. An H244A mutation in DENV2 NGC inhibits infectious virus production [43]. E H244 and its interacting partners D63 and D65 on pr are conserved within the flaviviruses, and thus these data from several flaviviruses plus our DENV results support an important role for the E 244 position. However, a histidine residue at this position does not seem to be strictly required for particle production, suggesting that substitutions such as 244F and 244N can support the interaction of E with pr.",

Mutant protein secretion was somewhat reduced, with the final yield of DI/II H244A about half that of the WT protein in two separate preparations (data not shown), suggesting some effects of non-optimal pr interaction. However, unlike the E protein in virus or VLP, the truncated DI/II protein lacks the TM region and does not mediate membrane fusion, and thus may be relatively independent of the pH-protection function of pr. The purified WT and mutant DI/II proteins were able to bind liposomes and form core trimers that were stabilized by DIII (Fig. 6). Thus, the mutant protein is correctly folded and active in membrane insertion. Studies with conformation-specific mAbs also provided evidence for the correct folding of H244A E protein (Fig. 8B). Together, these results suggest that the H244A E protein is still able to access the chaperone functions of prM, while its decreased pr binding indicates that it can no longer utilize the pH protection functions of pr.",

The membrane insertion and trimerization activity of H244A suggest that the full-length mutant protein would be fusion-active on such VLP once they are transported from the neutral pH of the ER to the low pH of the Golgi and TGN [31]. Thus, the decreased release of H244A VLP and its partial rescue by neutralization of the exocytic pathway support a critical role for pr in protecting DENV from exocytic low pH, and suggest that virus/VLP fuses in the TGN in the absence of pr-E interaction. Rescue of H244A VLP production by NH4Cl was clearly incomplete. This may be due to complex aspects of both virus and cell, such as direct effects of the H244A mutation on particle assembly in the ER, or difficulties in blocking fusion of a virus with the relatively high pH threshold of DENV.",

Such inhibitors could act at multiple points in the virus lifecycle. During virus protein biosynthesis, an inhibitor could block the chaperone interaction of prM with E, leading to misfolding of E and its elimination by the ER quality control pathway. An inhibitor of pr interaction could make E protein susceptible to premature fusion in the TGN and could thus block virus production similar to the H244A mutation. It is also possible that small molecule inhibitors of pr-E binding could interact directly with the DII tip on mature virus particles, perhaps stabilizing the dimer and/or blocking membrane insertion of the fusion loop, thereby blocking virus fusion. Thus the in vitro system we describe here has the potential to identify molecules that could aid in the study of the flavivirus lifecycle and that could act to inhibit specific steps.",

Under these conditions, the virus-pr complex does not bind target membranes, while virus from which pr is first released at neutral pH efficiently binds membranes upon shift to acid pH. Thus, the bound endogenous pr inhibits virus-membrane interaction and presumably blocks virus fusion [35]. Our results demonstrated that even after maturation to fully infectious DENV particles, exogenous pr could add back to the virus and inhibit low pH-triggered virus fusion and infection. The flavivirus membrane fusion reaction is very rapid, occurring within seconds of low pH treatment [47]. Recombinant DENV2 pr peptide inhibited fusion by both DENV1 and DENV2, suggestive of a fairly broad spectrum inhibition in agreement with the strong sequence conservation at the pr-E interface [34].",
