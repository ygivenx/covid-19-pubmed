This is exemplified by the recent Ebola virus outbreak in Western Africa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea [1]. Meanwhile, influenza viruses are still a great threat to human health [2,3]. So far, only two classes of antiviral drugs, which include amantadine and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are currently used as anti-influenza therapeutic drugs, but both of them have some adverse side effects in humans as well as the resistance of the virus towards this drug [4,5]. Hence, a concerted effort is aimed at discovering new antiviral agents to treat and eradicate these infectious agents [6,7].",

To further the scope of this particular research theme, a fungus, Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40, attracted our attention because its crude EtOAc extract exhibited potential antiviral activity. Further isolation yielded three new compounds: asteltoxin E (2), asteltoxin F (3) and 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchro mone (4), together with four known compounds: asteltoxin (1) [9], sterigmatocystin (5) [10,11], dihydrosterigmatocystin (6) [11,12], diorcinol (7) [13,14] (Figure 1). The antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activities of these compounds were individually evaluated. Herein, we described the isolation, structural elucidation, and bioactivity screening of these metabolites 1\u20137 from Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40.",

The molecular formula of 2 was established as C28H36O9 by the HRESIMS data (m/z 517.2440 [M + H]+), requiring 11 degrees of unsaturations. The UV spectrum showed maxima at 356, 300, 267, 211 nm, indicating the presence of an extended conjugated moiety. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptions for a hydroxy group at 3390 cm\u22121 and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group at 1697 cm\u22121 [15]. Close inspection of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1, Figures S1 and S2) of 2 using DEPT and 1H-13C correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) revealed the presence of six methyls (one oxygenated), two methylenes including one oxygen-bearing, 12 methines including three oxygenated methines, one double oxygenated methine (\u03b4H 5.27, \u03b4C 111.9) and eight olefinic methines ,as well as two sp3 quaternary carbons (one oxygenated), four sp2 quaternary carbons, including two oxygenated carbons (\u03b4C 154.7, 169.5) and two ester carbonyls (\u03b4C 163.7, 167.5). Comparing UV-vis and NMR data of compound 2 with those of asteltoxin (1) [9,16,17] revealed a high degree of similarity and a difference in the substituents of C-17. HMBC correlations observed from H3-28/C-24, C-25, C-26, H3-23/C-24 and H2-27/C-24, C-25, C-26 indicated the existence of a methyl crotonate moiety. In addition to this, the HMBC correlation of H2-27/C-17 and the chemical shift values of C-17 (\u03b4C 169.5) and C-27 (\u03b4C 65.9) suggested that C-27 was linked with C-17 through an oxygen bridge. Based on these analyses, the planar structure of 2 was determined to be as shown in Figure 2.",

The NOESY correlations of H-6/H3-21 revealed the cis fusion of the 2,8-dioxabi cyclo [3.3.0] octane. The NOESY correlations from H-6 to H-8; H-7 to H-8, H3-21 suggested that H-6, H-7, H-8 and H3-21 are positioned on the same side. The NOESY correlation of H-7/H3-20, as well as the lack of NOESY correlation between H3-20/H3-21, indicated that 4-OH was an \u03b1-configuration. The NOESY correlation of H3-20/H-3 indicated that the ethyl group at C-3 was in the \u03b1-configuration.

The molecular formula of 4 was established as C17H22O4 by the HRESIMS ion peak at m /z 291.1588 [M + H]+ (calculated for C17H23O4, 291.1591) requiring seven degrees of unsaturation. The strong absorptions in the IR spectrum at 3354 and 1628 cm\u22121 showed the existence of a hydroxy group and a carbonyl group [19,20]. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed 20 proton signals, two sp3 aliphatic methy protons (\u03b4H 0.86 and 1.15), five sp3 methylene protons (\u03b4H 1.29, 1.29, 1.48, 2.57 and 3.08), one oxymethine proton (\u03b4H 4.03), and three sp2 methine protons (\u03b4H 5.95, 6.59 and 6.62). The 13C-NMR spectra showed 17 signals, comprising two methyls, five methylenes, four methines and six quaternary carbon atoms. Accounting for five of the seven degrees of unsaturation suggested the presence of two rings. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data of compound 4 indicate that it is a chromone analogue. The only difference from 5-carbomethoxy methyl-2 heptyl-7-hydroxy chromone was the substituent of C-5 [21]. The 1H-1H COSY correlation of H2-14/H2-15, H2-17/H3-18 and HMBC correlations of H3-18/C-16 and C-17, H2-15/C-16 and C-17 indicated the presence of a pentyl moiety. In addition, the HMBC correlation of H3-14/C-5, C-6 and C-10 suggested that the pentyl was located at C-5 (Figure 4 and Table 2).",

In addition; compound 2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against H1N1 with IC50 value of 3.5 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcM. Compounds 2 and 3 were published online on 30 November 2015 as new compounds after the date we submitted on 2 November 2015 [25].",
