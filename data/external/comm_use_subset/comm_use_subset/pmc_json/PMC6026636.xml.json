            "text": "The human intestinal microbiota undergoes rapid dynamic changes in the first few months to years of life and these changes are hypothesized to shape future health (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with a wide range of diseases in humans, from gastrointestinal illnesses (Frank et al., 2007; Manichanh et al., 2012; Collins, 2014) to metabolic (Tilg and Kaser, 2011), atopic (Fujimura et al., 2014; West et al., 2015), and even neurodevelopmental conditions (Hsiao et al., 2013). Infants born prematurely and in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are particularly vulnerable and have been shown to exhibit aberrant microbiota development, including harboring high levels of antimicrobial resistance genes (Costello et al., 2013; La Rosa et al., 2014; Gibson et al., 2016; Gasparrini et al., 2016). Moreover premature infants are at risk of developing conditions associated with microbiota dysbiosis, both in the NICU, such as life threatening necrotizing enterocolitis (Pammi et al., 2017a), and later in life (Boyle et al., 2012). In addition, it is also recognized that the human skin microbiome undergoes critical maturation in infancy (Capone et al., 2011) and can be influenced by prematurity (Pammi et al., 2017b). Aberrant development of the skin microbiome has the potential to allow pathogen colonization and has also been associated with the development of atopic dermatitis (Kennedy et al., 2017).",

Neonates with an anticipated length of stay within the NICU of over 5 days were recruited within 3 days of life. Detailed maternal, pregnancy and delivery data were collected. While in the NICU infants had stool collected twice a week and frozen at -80\u00b0C within 12 h. Skin swabs were collected every 2 weeks using an E-Swab (Coplan, Murrieta, CA, United States) moistened with sterile saline gently rolled about 10 times in the groin area in the inguinal region.

Samples were transferred into mechanical lysis matrix tubes (MP Biomedical, Santa Ana, CA, United States). All samples were homogenized for 10 min on an oscillating vortexer (Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA, United States) at maximum speed and placed briefly in a flash spinner to remove excess liquid from the cap (Wang et al., 2008; de Boer et al., 2010; Salonen et al., 2010; Khelaifia et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014). Twenty five microliters of lysozyme was added at 20 mg/mL to the sample tubes and inverted ten times to mix (Wang et al., 2008). Samples were placed on a rotating heat block at 95\u00b0C for 5 min at 2000 rpm and cooled on ice for 2\u20135 min.

Then one Inhibit X tablet (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) was added to each tube and vortexed until the tablet completely dissolved and incubated at room temperature for 3 min (Wang et al., 2008). Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7g for 2 min; supernatant was removed and put into a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged again at 20,000 \u00d7g for 3 min (Wang et al., 2008). To finish extraction on the EZ1 (Qiagen, Valencia CA, United States), 400 uL were placed into an extraction tube and loaded onto the machine using the EZ1 DSP kit with the viral extraction protocol card. Each sample was cleaned and concentrated using the NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-up XS kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG).",

CosmosID is a microbial genomics platform focused on rapid characterization of microorganisms, pathogens and anti-microbial resistance for infectious disease identification, food safety inspections, pharmaceutical discovery, public health surveillance and microbiome analysis. CosmosID bioinformatics utilizes high performance data mining algorithms and highly curated dynamic comparator databases (GenBook\u00ae) that are readily accessible by cloud interface. The curated databases provide extremely fine resolution in identification, discrimination of pathogens from \u2018near neighbors\u2019, and accurate measurement of relative abundances. CosmosID utilizes a high performance data-mining K-mer based algorithm that rapidly disambiguates hundreds of millions of short reads of a metagenomic sample into the discrete microorganisms engendering the particular sequences. While the tools are flexible and can be used to compare whole genomes, the principal software pipeline has been optimized for processing unmapped and unaligned raw sequence reads of lengths less than 100 basepairs. The pipeline has two separable comparators. The first consists of a pre-computation phase and a per-sample computation. The input to the pre-computation phase is a reference microbial database, and its output is a whole genome phylogeny tree, together with sets of fixed length k-mer fingerprints (biomarkers) that are uniquely identified with distinct nodes of the tree. The second per-sample, computational phase searches the hundreds of millions of short sequence reads against the fingerprint sets in minutes. The resulting statistics are analyzed to give fine-grain composition and relative abundance estimates at all nodes of the tree. The second comparator uses edit distance-scoring techniques to compare a target sample with a reference set. The algorithm provides similar functionality to BLAST but sacrifices some recall precision for a one or two order of magnitude processing gain. Overall classification precision is maintained through aggregation statistics. This second comparator may be used independently of the first. However, enhanced discriminatory power is achieved by running the comparators in sequence. The first comparator finds reads in which there is an exact match with an n-mer uniquely identified with a set of reference strains; the second comparator then statistically scores the entire read against the reference to verify that the read is indeed uniquely identified with that set. Similarly, the community resistome and virulome, the collection of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes respectively in the microbiome, were also profiled by querying unassembled sequence reads against CosmosID curated antibiotic resistance and virulence gene databases.",

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using the Bray-Curtis distance measure and clustered using the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1987).

More antibiotic resistance genes were differentially abundant in samples collected from the new NICU compared to the old NICU for all sample types. Of note, in stool samples, both 2 week and discharge, and skin swabs, beta lactam resistance genes were notably more differentially abundant in the new NICU samples than the old NICU. Due to the difference in antibiotic use seen between the 2 cohorts (higher use in old NICU), differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes were compared between only those who received antibiotics in the old and new NICU, and between those who did not receive antibiotics in the old and new NICU (Supplementary Figures S3A,B, respectively). In those who received antibiotics, more differentially abundant genes were seen in the new NICU compared with the old NICU in the 2 week stool sample only. Of note, in those who received antibiotics, different differentially abundant genes were identified compared with the cohort as a whole, with tetracycline resistance genes more abundant in the new NICU. In comparing those without antibiotic exposure, differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes were only seen in skin swabs, with more genes in the new NICU. Due to the difference seen in infants primarily receiving breast milk (higher in the old NICU), differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes were compared between only those who primarily received breast milk in the old and new NICU, and between those who did not primarily receive breast milk in the old and new NICU (Supplementary Figures S4A,B, respectively).

            "text": "Notably, differentially abundant antibiotic resistance genes were observed in all sample types (stool, skin, and environment) between both cohorts, with more abundant antibiotic resistance genes detected in samples collected from the new NICU. The hypothesis was that the new single-family room NICU would have fewer antibiotic resistance genes detected in the microbiota of infants because single-family room NICUs have been shown to have decreased rates of nosocomial sepsis (Domanico et al., 2011). In addition, it is assumed that there is patient to patient transfer of microbiota, including those microorganisms with antibiotic resistance potential, via hand carriage of health workers. Open bay NICUs are hypothesized to lead to decreased hand washing frequency or less efficiency between patients whereas private rooms have readily accessible hand washing stations in each room, providing more opportunity for hand washing by healthcare workers (Saiman, 2002; Walsh et al., 2006). The results were therefore surprising, finding more abundant antibiotic resistance genes in samples collected from the new NICU, especially as there was significantly less antibiotic use in the new NICU compared with the old, with antibiotic use being a known risk factor (Gasparrini et al., 2016; Gibson et al., 2016). Specifically, cephalosporin use was less in the new NICU, even though beta lactam resistance genes were relatively more abundant in stool and skin samples in the new NICU. Even when antimicrobial resistance genes were compared in only those who had received antibiotics, differentially abundant genes were found between the two cohorts although the specific genes did differ. A possible explanation for the differentially abundant antibiotic resistance genes between samples from the two cohorts is that the resistome in this study may reflect the new NICU being located in a newly constructed building, that was previously unoccupied. A recent study by Lax et al. (2017) examined microbiota colonization and succession in a newly opened hospital, using both environmental and skin swabs. Bacterial communities on the skin of patients and from room surfaces became increasingly similar over the course of a patient\u2019s stay and alpha and beta diversity of skin swabs was found to be only weakly associated with antibiotic usage. Moreover, Lax et al. (2017) showed in samples that underwent metagenomic sequencing, antibiotic resistance genes were more prevalent on surfaces of the room than on skin of the patient. The combined results do indicate that the microbiota of a patient is susceptible to influence of the environmental microbiota in a building. This factor may be more influential in the NICU sample comparisons of this study as newborns begin life with a very \u201cna\u00efve\u201d immature microbiota and may be more vulnerable to colonization from external sources. Antimicrobial resistance genes have a survival advantage and may be more prevalent when there is less competition from lack of established bacterial communities in a new building. It is possible that over time the new NICU \u201cmatures\u201d in terms of microbiota colonization, effecting favorable change in the community resistome. Another possible explanation of the finding is that neonates in the new NICU are potentially exposed to fewer caregivers and if a specific caregiver carries more of these genes they may be more likely to colonize the infant. However, contradicting this, it was found that antimicrobial resistance genes in the new NICU did not cluster in certain individuals and were found in all sample types across infants. Lastly, it could be hypothesized that differences in feeding and nutrition between the 2 cohorts may have contributed to the difference in antimicrobial resistance genes seen. However, more infants primarily received breast milk in the old NICU, which is thought to be a protective factor (Marks et al., 2013), yet more differentially abundant antimicrobial genes were seen in the new NICU. Indeed, even when samples from only infants who primarily received breast milk were examined overall more differentially abundant antimicrobial genes were still seen in the new NICU.",

It is important to note that no infant from either cohort developed any clinically detectable infections caused by antibiotic resistant organisms or organisms associated with the detected virulence factors during their NICU stay. It is imperative to repeat this study with neonates who have been in the new NICU for a longer time after opening to determine whether differences observed in our study were more reflective of a new building or of a single-family room environment. Moreover, it is key to determine whether these observed differences persist into childhood, with long term health outcomes.

Individual variability and small sample size may be factors, but differences were observed in both patient skin and environmental samples. It will be important to monitor ecological succession of new NICU as it matures over time and determine whether these differences persist and exert any long-term outcomes for neonates. Although no differences were detected in DNA viruses, fungi, and parasites between the two patient cohorts, this comprehensive exploration emphasizes the power of such analysis for detection of potential pathogens and characterization of the virulome and resistome.

Power calculations for the differentially abundant gene statistics were conducted using the size R package (Bi and Liu, 2016) (Supplementary Figure S5). Also several types of patient samples were examined (stool at 2 weeks, discharge stool samples, and skin swabs) and the discharge stool sample was collected at differing ages for each patient depending on their length of stay adding further variation to the samples. However, the findings of the study are strengthened by the fact that differences in resistome and virulome between the two cohorts were detected in all sample types. The subjects of this study were carefully clinically matched but this was limited by sample size. Nevertheless, antibiotic usage and exclusive breast or donor milk feeding did differ between the two cohorts. More recently NICU practice generally has moved away from using empiric antibiotics for premature infants, with much less use of antibiotics in the new NICU than the old NICU in our study. This makes the finding of relatively more differentially abundant antibiotic resistance genes in the new NICU more intriguing and possibly more related to being a newly constructed facility. While the vast majority of infants in the new NICU (17/18) received some breast milk or donor milk, the fact that there were more infants that received exclusive breast milk or donor milk after TPN use in the old NICU may have had some influence on the microbiomes of the two cohorts (Cong et al., 2016). Nevertheless, differences in community resistome and virulome were detected in environmental samples also and not just infant samples. While this pilot study was exploratory and descriptive by nature, with clinical factors not fully controlled in both groups and with limited sample size to enable detailed further stratification by clinical features, it is the first study of its kind to give an overview of the potential environmental influences on the microbial community and its associated resistome and viruolme. Although the aim of this study was not to build associations, this will be examined in depth as the study is expanded with more individuals and samples from both environments, and critically when the new NICU has had time to \u201cmature\u201d and become stable through the process of ecological succession over time. Lastly, examining longitudinal microbiome development into childhood, as possible in a longitudinal cohort study such as this, is imperative to understand whether these early changes detected have any lasting impact on childhood health.",
