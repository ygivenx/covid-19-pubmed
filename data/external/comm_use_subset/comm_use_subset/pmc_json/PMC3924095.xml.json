In the United States, the average rate of EMS utilization by the elderly (persons aged \u226565 years) was more than 4 times that of younger patients.7 Despite these problems in the EMS, the effort to improve the effectiveness of the EMS is justified because emergency medicine offers many tools for improving public health.8 In 1994, the average number of daily ED visits nationwide in Taiwan was 11,888. This increased to 13,634 in 1996, 14,911 in 1998, 16,943 in 2000, 18,085 in 2002, and 18,823 in 2004. However, the numbers of accredited hospitals in Taiwan decreased from 828, to 773, 719, 669, 610, and 590, respectively, in the same years.9 ED overcrowding has been a continuing problem in Taiwan, as has the uneven distribution of ED visits. In 2003, for example, there were 24 tertiary medical centers in Taiwan, and the average number of ED visits at these centers was 187.5 cases per day\u20146.7 times higher than the national average.10 It is clear, therefore, that a nationwide descriptive study of EMS utilization is needed in Taiwan. We conducted an epidemiologic survey of EMS in Taiwan in order to provide sufficient information for policymakers to make decisions regarding the redistribution of national medical resources.",

As of 2007, 22.60 million of Taiwan\u2019s 22.96 million-person population were enrolled in this program. Foreigners in Taiwan are also eligible to enroll this program. Therefore, Taiwan\u2019s NHI Plan has accumulated data on 23.75 million people and their claims, the largest set of such data in the world. In order to respond to current and emerging health issues rapidly and effectively, the National Health Research Institute (NHRI), in cooperation with the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB), has established an NHI research database. The NHRI safeguards the privacy and confidentiality of subjects and routinely transfers health insurance data from the NHIB to health researchers for analysis, with the aim of improving the health of Taiwan\u2019s citizens.",

The hospitals located outside of the United States were in Europe (United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Portugal) and Asia (Taiwan and Singapore). According to the acute-care indicators report for the fourth quarter of 2004, aggregated descriptive statistics showed that unscheduled returns to the ED within 24 hours and 48 hours represented 0.99% and 1.51% of ED visits in the United States, 2.71% and 4.16% of visits in Europe, and 1.33% and 2.15% of visits in Asia. Interestingly, these indicators of unscheduled revisits in ED were positively associated with the amount of ED utilization. The reported denominators (ie, ED visitors per hospital) were approximately 2,400, 5,200, and 8,900 cases per month in the United States, Asia, and Europe, respectively.12",

A report based on data from the 2005 US NHAMCS showed that an estimated 115.3 million visits were made to hospital EDs, ie, approximately 39.6 visits per 100 persons, and that there were an estimated 41.9 million injury-related visits, or 14.4 visits per 100 persons.

In a study sampling 95,173 residents of Canada aged 65 or older, the presence of 2 co-morbidities (cardiovascular diseases and digestive diseases) was associated with increased ED use; the adjusted rate ratios were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.39\u20131.44) and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.64\u20131.68), respectively.16 In the United Kingdom, an investigation concluded that pressure on emergency care was associated with a disproportionate increase in the number of elderly patients. Between 1990 and 2004, the total number of patients had increased by 54%, with a disproportionate increase of 198% in patients aged over 70 years. They also found that the time required to manage patients increases with age, and that older patients required 9.8 times more emergency bed days.17 Perhaps this situation is likely to occur in Taiwan because an increase in the proportion of elderly patients treated in EDs has been noted in our survey: the percentage of elderly patients, ie, those aged 70 or older, increased from 10.8% to 12.8% from 2000 to 2004.",

Taiwan\u2019s health insurance program, which began in 1995, is a single-insurer system with a cost containment policy that mandates a fixed co-payment by the insured person for ambulatory medical services. This policy probably resulted in the increase in daily ED utilization (158% from 1994 to 2004).9",

If NHE is compared to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the NHE/GDP ratio was lower in Taiwan (6.2%) than in the United States (15.2%), Germany (10.9%), France (10.4%), Portugal (10.0%), Netherlands (9.2%), United Kingdom (7.9%), and even Japan (8.0%) in 2003.21 Taken together, these findings show that although the number of ED visits in Taiwan is high, the cost of ED treatment is lower than in other countries.",

Commonly studied solutions of crowding included additional personnel, observation units, hospital bed access, nonurgent referrals, ambulance diversion, destination control, crowding measures, and queuing theory.23 A consideration of these options from the latest systematic review would be helpful in assisting the government of Taiwan\u2019s efforts to initiate essential studies, organize all associated facilities, and formulate a comprehensive policy for EMS.",

Another limitation of the study was that fewer subjects were available for sampling in 2003, because ED visits decreased by 40% to 50% during the SARS epidemic, a situation that persisted for 3 months after the end of the epidemic.24,25 Finally, the value of the Taiwanese currency fluctuated considerably during the years from 2000 to 2004, which makes it more difficult to interpret the currency conversions we have utilized.",

Implementing the widespread primary care reforms necessary to meaningfully reduce ED utilization will be complex and expansive, although they are likely to benefit both patients and the health system.26 Complicated complaints and multiple diagnoses occurred more frequently in the elderly, and this should be considered when policymakers plan changes to Taiwan\u2019s emergency system and resource allocation. Strategies to improve continuity of care may result in lower ED use and reduced health care costs. Such strategies might prove superior to current managed care policies that attempt to control costs by denying access to emergency care.27 Recently, a group-visit model has been studied and deemed effective in improving patient and physician satisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, and in decreasing visits to emergency departments and specialists.28 Therefore, we believe that additional public education regarding preventive medicine and increased activities geared toward community health promotion would prove suitable and effective in decreasing ED crowding in Taiwan.",
