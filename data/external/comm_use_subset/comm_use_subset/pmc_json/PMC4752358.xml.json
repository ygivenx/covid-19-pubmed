This enveloped virus infects hepatocytes and causes serious liver diseases in humans. Past treatment of HCV included the use of interferon and ribavirin, a combination that was not very effective and not well tolerated. However, a new era finally started in 2014 thanks to the development of direct-acting antiviral arsenal which enables to achieve a sustained virologic response in more than 90% of treated patients in clinical trials [2]. Nevertheless, some concerns remain such as access to care in low- to middle-income countries or viral resistance that could be encountered in real-life less-compliant populations.",

            "text": "HCV entry into hepatocytes is a complex multistep process that involves viral envelope glycoproteins and several cell entry factors including CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN [3]. E1 and E2 are the two envelope glycoproteins that are present on the surface of viral particles as large covalent complexes stabilized by disulfide bridges [4]. Both glycoproteins are heavily N-glycosylated and, as a result, one third of the molecular mass of E1E2 heterodimers corresponds to N-glycans. Indeed, 4 and 11 N-glycosylation sites are conserved in E1 and E2 sequences from most genotypes and it has been shown that the majority of these sites harbor high-mannose-type glycans, even after egress of viral particles from the cells [4]. In addition, we contributed to demonstrate that the corresponding N-glycans play an important role for the function of these proteins: i) they enable the correct folding of the envelope proteins, ii) they modulate the efficiency of the entry step and iii) they mask conserved neutralizing epitopes on E2 envelope glycoprotein close to the binding site to the cellular receptor CD81 [5\u20139]. These features make HCV N-glycans promising target for new antiviral strategies, all the more as high-mannose glycans are rarely present on cellular proteins after their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. A proof of concept has been provided in vitro and in vivo by using several lectins such as Cyanovirin-N, Griffithsin or Scytovirin as well as the non-peptidic carbohydrate binding agent (CBA) Pradimicin-A [10\u201315]. However, a potential resistance of HCV to such a therapeutic strategy has never been investigated.",

We took advantage of the HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cell line which enables to monitor HCV infection in living cells [17, 19]. First, we infected HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cells in the presence of the 90% effective concentration of each lectin (1, 0.1, 2 and 1 \u03bcg/mL for GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT, respectively). Infected cells were then subcultured every three to four days in the presence of the lectin until 100% cells were infected. As soon as all cells were infected, supernatants were recovered and used to infect naive cells in the presence of the lectins. The concentrations of each lectin were increased in a stepwise manner as described in Fig 1. In these conditions, we were able to propagate HCV in the presence of 30 \u03bcg/mL of GNA after three months and 2 \u03bcg/mL of CV-N after two months. The highest possible ConA concentration was 10 \u03bcg/mL due to toxicity of the drug in the cell culture at higher concentrations (S1 Fig). Remarkably, it was difficult to propagate the virus in the presence of GRFT suggesting that adaptation of HCV to this lectin was more challenging. To confirm that we isolated CBA resistant strains, we compared the sensitivity of the isolated strains and the parental strain to lectins. As shown in Fig 2, we observed that the strains isolated in the presence of GNA, CV-N and GRFT were less sensitive to these lectins than the parental strain. In contrast, the strain isolated in the presence of ConA seemed to be as sensitive as the parental strain to ConA.",

Three mutations were identified after the three month culture with GNA: V284A in E1 and V392D / S449P in E2. Interestingly, the mutation S449P is expected to prevent the addition of the N-glycan on the E2N4 N-glycosylation site at position 448, by introducing a proline residue between the asparagine 448 and the serine 450. The mutation M338V in E2 was found after the culture of HCV in the presence of CV-N, ConA and GRFT. Interestingly, we also identified the mutation L755M in p7 in the three viruses isolated after culture with these lectins. Three other mutations, L612M, N417S and A400D, were also detected in the viruses selected with CV-N, ConA and GRFT, respectively. The N417S mutation has previously been shown to lead to a shift of the E2N1 N-glycan from N417 to N415 [26]. Importantly, when the virus was passaged in absence of lectin, we only detected the mutation I599V in E2. These mutations are summarized in bold characters in Table 1. Using the European Hepatitis C Virus database (euHCVdb) [27], we observed that mutations V284A, N417S, S449P and L755M occurred on residues which are highly conserved not only in genotype 2a HCV sequences but also in sequences of other genotypes (Table 2). In these sequences, only three synonymous mutations were identified (one in the end of Core, and two in p7, after GNA exposure). Altogether, these results suggest that a positive selection occurred on the HCV envelope protein genes in the presence of lectins. This was also supported by the cumulative behavior of the dS/dN ratio, obtained using the Synonymous / Non-synonymous Analysis Program (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html) [28] and comparing the four sequences obtained after lectin exposure and the control sequence obtained after culture without lectin (S2 Fig).",

Since the mutation L755M in p7 was fixed in three independent lectin exposures, we also decided to characterize it. Mutations were introduced alone or by combination of 2 or 3. A replication- defective virus carrying a mutation in the NS5B GDD motif (GND) and a variant genome carrying a large in-frame deletion in the E1E2 coding region known to inactivate viral particle release (\u0394E1E2) were used as negative controls for replication and assembly, respectively [16]. First, we assessed the impact of the mutations on HCV RNA replication. As shown in Fig 3A, some individual mutations or combinations of two mutations led to slight variations of the replication measured as Luciferase activities 24, 48 and 72 h after electroporation. An increased replication was observed at 72 h for the N417S, L612M and V284A-S449P mutants (1.6-, 1.6- and 2.0-fold WT respectively, p < 0.05). In contrast, the mutant V284A-V392D showed a slight decrease of replication (0.6-fold WT, p < 0.05). However, the combinations of three mutations did not have any significant effect on replication as compared to WT (1.2-, 1.2-, 1.7- and 1.4-fold WT at 72 h for V284A-V392D-S449P / M338V-A400D-L755M / M338V-N417S-L755M / M338V-L612M-L755M, respectively). Using western blotting on electroporated cells, we observed that E2 proteins containing the S449P mutation migrated slightly faster than the WT E2 which confirmed that this mutation leads to an impediment of the asparagine 448 N-glycosylation (Fig 4). In addition, the detection of E2 for the mutants containing the N417S substitution was often weaker than the WT E2 because this residue is involved in the epitope of the 3/11 MAb which was used for the western blot. To further characterize our mutants, infectious virus production was measured at 48 h post-electroporation for each mutant and compared to that of the WT. Supernatant of cells electroporated with the \u0394E1E2 mutants was used as negative control to determine the background level of Luciferase activity. As shown in Fig 3B, the production of infectious virus for A400D and A400D-L755M mutants was significantly decreased as compared to that of the WT (3.0- and 2.5-fold WT, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). On the contrary, results suggest that other combinations of two mutations positively modulate infectivity. The production of infectious viral particles was markedly improved for the V392D-S449P and L612M-L755M mutants (3.5- and 3.0-fold WT, p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). However, the different combinations of three mutations that were found at the end of each selection did not have any significant effect on infectious viral particle production.",

We also analyzed the effect of simple mutation and combination of two mutations on the sensitivity to inhibition by lectins. In the same way, we did not evidence any resistance conferred by the mutations selected upon GNA, CV-N or ConA exposure, alone or in combination of two (S3 Fig). The results obtained with A400D, M338V-A400D and A400D-L755M mutants were surprising since at low concentrations of GRFT (between 0.03 \u03bcg/mL and 0.3 \u03bcg/mL), the infectivity was increased (S3 Fig).

For this reason, we sequenced the regions encoding the Core and the non-structural proteins of the strains isolated upon lectin exposure. This enabled us to identify several additional mutations (7, 3, 4 and 5 upon GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT exposure, respectively). These mutations are presented in non-bold characters in Table 1. Interestingly, similar mutations at some of these positions had already been identified by other groups during JFH1 cell culture adaptation (I30S [29], P2271L [30], C2441S [17, 31\u201333], I2270T [33\u201335], D2227V [36], D2254G [34]) and several of these mutations have been shown to be beneficial for the virus, in particular for the assembly process. Furthermore, the cumulative behavior of the dS/dN ratio (S2 Fig) also evidenced that the region encoding the end of NS5A, which is essential for cell culture adaptation, was under positive selection. Altogether, our results suggest that HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the E1E2 envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the mechanisms of HCV resistance to CBAs.",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed at evaluating the resistance of HCV to CBAs in vitro. After more than eight weeks of HCV culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of different lectins, we identified several mutations in the genomes of the isolated strains, and evidenced a positive selection on the E1E2 coding region, as a consequence of the V284A, M338V, V392D, A400D, N417S, S449P and L612M non-synonymous mutations. Other mutations were also detected in the regions encoding the Core and the non-structural proteins of the isolated strains, with a second region under positive selection corresponding to the end of NS5A, a region known to be frequently mutated during cell culture adaptation. The characterization of the E1E2 mutations, alone or in combination, evidenced that none of these mutations confer resistance to CBAs. Importantly, when similar experiments were performed in the presence of neutralizing MAbs, escape mutations were observed as early as 5 days post treatment [26, 37\u201339]. Several explanations can be put forward to explain the difference between HCV resistance to MAbs and CBAs. Firstly, it is important to note that E1 and E2 bring many conserved N-glycans, thus many CBA targets, which have been shown to play an important role in the different steps of the HCV life cycle. Moreover, it has to be noticed that in contrast to neutralizing antibodies, CBAs are able to inhibit cell free as well as cell to cell transmission [14]. Finally, it has also been proposed that some lectins could act through both viral and cellular glycan interactions [13].",

            "text": "In case of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), it has been proposed that a CBA-based therapeutic strategy could not only directly inhibit viruses, but also induce partial loss of the glycan shield and make viruses more vulnerable to attack by the immune system [40, 41]. Interestingly, we observed that even if no resistance mutation could be evidenced in the E1E2 HCV envelope glycoproteins, the positive selection which occurred led to a modification of the HCV glycan shield. Indeed, among the identified mutations, the S449P amino acid change prevents the N-glycosylation of the asparagine 448 residue corresponding to the E2N4 glycosylation site which is important for HCV particle assembly and infectivity as well as protection against neutralization. Using the 3/11 neutralizing MAb, we confirmed that this mutation renders the viral particle more sensitive to neutralization. We also identified the mutation N417S which has previously been thoroughly characterized. This mutation (or the related mutation N417T) has been described as an adaptive mutation enhancing the entry process in vitro [42\u201346]. In our study, this mutation was responsible for a 1.7-fold increase of the infectivity but this was not significant. This mutation is also known to lead to a shift of the E2N1 N-glycan from N417 to N415, which prevents the recognition of N415 residue by several neutralizing antibodies, as observed here with the 3/11 neutralizing MAb [26, 37, 38, 47, 48]. Interestingly, dose response curves using single, double and triple mutants suggest that this mutation was also responsible for an increased sensitivity to GNA (Fig 5A and data not shown). Since GNA binds to mannose termini and lactosamine structures that are present in high-mannose-, hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans, the increased sensitivity may not be caused by a difference of N-glycan maturation. Instead, a better accessibility of the E2N1 N-glycan to the GNA could explain this feature. Interestingly, our results reveal that the mutation L612M, which may be critical for the overall E2 architecture [49], also increases the sensitivity to GNA (Fig 5A and data not shown). However, caution must be taken because such mutations which do not confer lectin resistance but increase the sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies may not be fixed in vivo, in the presence of the humoral immunity. Thus, in contrast to HIV [40, 41], it seems unlikely that development of HCV resistance against CBAs would result in an enhancement of neutralization by the immune system.",

At best, it may be used for the prevention of graft reinfection in HCV-infected liver transplant patients or possibly for the treatment of HCV-HIV coinfected patients where drug interactions with antiretrovirals are frequently observed. However, an important feature of CBA-based therapeutic strategy is the broad antiviral spectrum. In particular, CBAs have been shown to efficiently inhibit several emergent viruses such as Dengue Virus [51], Ebola Virus [52, 53] or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [54, 55]. To our knowledge, viral resistance to CBAs had only been evaluated using HIV strains, which are characterized by an evolving glycan shield. Thus, our results bring new insights into the development of CBA-based antiviral strategy since they suggest that HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the E1E2 envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",
