Studies focused on protection of\ndrugs based on RBD (subunit vaccines) showed that RBD vaccination protected ~\n80% of animals from MERS-CoV, despite the high titers of neutralizing\nantibodies capable of blocking the interaction between the virus and the DPP4\nreceptor on the cell surface [42, 59]. The lack of 100% protection seems to be\nrelated to the need to develop a cellular immune response, as well as the need\nto block fusion of the viral and cell membranes, which is mediated by the S2\nsubunit. Furthermore, application of subunit-based vaccines, as well as\ninactivated ones, prevents the emergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response and\noften leads to the development of Th2-skewed immunity [22, 42]. In the case of\nMERS, its development can lead to lung immunopathologies [48].

Strong antibody (mainly IgG1 and IgG2a) and T-cell immune\nresponses developed in animals vaccinated with rAd5 expressing various forms of\nthe MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Each of the rAd5 variants allowed for the\nemergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response, which is one of the key aspects in\nthe development of an anti-MERS vaccine. In a study focused on the intensity of\nthe humoral immune response, the membrane form of the RBD (rAd5-RBD-G) elicited\na more powerful IgG response than the other studied forms. It was also\ndemonstrated that only the membrane forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S,\nrAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies.\nIn the investigation of cellular immune response intensity, the forms of the\nfull-length MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S and rAd5-S-G) were characterized by\nthe strongest immunogenicity.\n",
