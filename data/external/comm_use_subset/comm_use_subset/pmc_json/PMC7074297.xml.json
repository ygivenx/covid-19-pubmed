The impact of such a dramatic restriction on human migration on the epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV will be soon visually identifiable, but this change made it difficult to update the cumulative incidence estimate using exported case data outside China [1]. Presently, exponential growth of confirmed cases has continued in China, but a substantial number of infections may have missed being diagnosed and reported.",

A total of 565 Japanese citizens boarded three different flights and were evacuated. As of 2 February 2020, healthy individuals are quarantined with movement restrictions and brought under medical observation at designated hotels and dormitories. An additional 63 individuals who were determined to have symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection upon arrival in Japan were all admitted to hospitals. The evacuation procedures involved in these flights have offered a unique opportunity for evaluation of the rate of underascertainment of 2019-nCoV cases in China.

Prior to disembarkation, the quarantine officers used portable thermoscanners to screen the temperature. In the following, all passengers were interviewed regarding whether they have any symptoms suggestive of upper raspiratory tract infection, including fever and cough. Of the 565 passengers, 63 were symptomatic. Second, the passengers were tested for presence of 2019-nCoV using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and eight passengers (1.4%) were determined to have the virus. Importantly, most of the individuals positive for the virus were asymptomatic (five passengers), while only the other three had symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection, indicating that the dataset generated from this process can help investigate the full spectrum of infection including mild and asymptomatic infections.

While T is assumed as 10.0 days elsewhere [2] and even longer in an earlier study [1], the mean serial interval has recently been estimated at 7.5 days [3]. Another modeling study estimated the mean infectious period to be 3.6 days [4]. Here we set the serial interval to be 7.5 days as the default, and 3.6 and 10.0 days as the possible range of uncertainty. The balance equation for the risk of infection is thus written:(1)8565=c(t)Tqn",

However, the risk of death among all infected individuals is likely much smaller. With our estimate of ~10% ascertainment, the actual risk of death is therefore 0.3% to 0.6% among all infected individuals (abbreviated as iCFR or IFR) [6], which may be comparable to the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957\u20131958. However, it should be noted that quoted values of IFR may be oversestimated if the ascertainment rate is biased due to difficulties in detection of 2019-nCoV using RT-PCR (e.g., very short detection window of the virus during the course of infection).
