Virus-cell and cell\u2013cell membrane fusion, mediated by fusion proteins associated with viral envelope, is crucial for the entry of enveloped viruses into cells and for rapid spread of infection to the neighboring cells. This membrane fusion process may, therefore, be a limiting point for efficient adaptation and infection of an animal virus in cells from a different host species. In this study, we report that acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity by point mutations in the spike (S) protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) plays a critical role in adaptation and/or selection of a variant that infects cultured cells.",

IBV, the prototype member of coronavirus, causes highly contagious diseases in chicken and is a constant threat to the poultry industry. Coronavirus was traditionally considered to have narrow host specificities [2]. However, the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a serious zoonotic transmission event caused by a novel coronavirus, demonstrate that a certain coronvirus species may exhibit wider host specificities and suggests the possibility of cross-species transmission of animal coronaviruses to human [3], [4]. Cross-species transmission was also observed in coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus OC43 [5]\u2013[7]. These events highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms of interspecies adaptation and transmission of coronavirus.",

Among them, 26 amino acid substitutions are in the S protein [10]. In this study, expression of S protein cloned from IBV strains EP3, CK, passage 7 (p7) and p65 of Vero-adapted IBV showed induction of cell\u2013cell fusion by S(CK), S(p7) and S(p65) constructs. However, no formation of syncytial cells was observed in cells expressing S(EP3). Construction of chimeric S constructs and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at the amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region (L857-F) that confers the non-fusogenic S protein to fusogenic. Re-introduction of the F857-L mutation back to the genome of Vero-adapted IBV (p65) showed rescue of virus containing the F857-L mutation. However, compensatory mutations occurred in the S1 region that could rescue the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S constructs carrying the F857-L mutation.",

Constructs CK3(S826-N) and CK(F857-L) were made by mutation of the S826 and F857 residues in S(CK) to N and L, respectively (Fig. 3a).

On the other hand, mutation of the F857 residue to L totally abolishes the fusion activity of S(CK) (Fig. 3c, panel CK(F867-L). The relative cell\u2013cell fusion activities of these S constructs are CK(S826-N)>EP3(L857-F)\u226bEP3 = CK(F857-L).

Comparison of amino acid sequences between S(p7) and S(p65) revealed a single mutation at the amino acid position 405 (G405-D) in S(p65) (Fig. 1a). To analyze the possibility that the enhanced infectivity of p65 virus is due to the enhanced cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the corresponding S protein, S(p7) and S(p65) constructs were created and expressed in Vero cells. Efficient induction of cell\u2013cell fusion was observed in cells transfected with both constructs (Fig. 6a, panels S(p7) and S(p65) and 6b, lanes 3 and 4). Comparatively, significantly larger syncytia was observed in cells expressing S(p65) construct than in cells expressing S(p7) (Fig. 6a), demonstrating that the additional G405-D mutation in S(p65) may enhance its cell\u2013cell fusion activity. The G405-D mutation was then introduced into S(EP3) and S(CK) and expressed (Fig. 6a), showing that introduction of G405-D mutation into S(CK) drastically enhanced its cell\u2013cell fusion activity (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, introduction of the mutation into S(EP3) and expression of the construct in Vero cells showed formation of small syncytial cells (Fig. 6b).

            "text": "Avian coronaviruses have been isolated from chicken, turkey and pheasant and may exist in many other avian species [20]. IBV is usually associated with respiratory disease in domestic fowl, and was believed to have a limited host range. Chicken is the only natural host. Similarly, coronaviruses originated from human and other animal species were considered to have narrow host specificities until the identification of SARS-CoV as the causative agent of SARS outbreaks in 2003. The current model of animal origin of SARS-CoV highlights the importance of cross-species adaptation and transmission of animal coronaviruses to human. Cross-species transmission of virus infection has long been recognized as a way for the emergence of many zoonotic diseases. The molecular basis for this phenomenon would lie on the rapid adaptation of certain viruses to a changing environment through selection of minor variants from quasispecies, accumulation of mutations, recombination between minor variants, and reassortment of their genomes. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control these events would be essential for providing safeguards to limit the impact of these devastating diseases. In this study, we show that acquisition and enhancement of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the S protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of IBV to cultured cells. Data present clearly show that the L857-F mutation in the heptad repeat 1 region of S proteins derived from cell-culture-adapted IBV is important for adaptation of the virus to cell culture systems, and an additional mutation in the S1 region (G405-D) could enhance this process. As S protein carrying the L857-F mutation is able to induce cell\u2013cell fusion, but losses the activity when F857 was mutated back to L, it suggests that induction of cell\u2013cell fusion is an essential step in adaptation/selection of IBV to cultured mammalian cells.",

It is a class I fusion protein and mediates viral entry by specific binding of the S1 domain to a host cell receptor [21]\u2013[25]. The cellular receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified, including members of the cacinoembryonic antigen family of cell adhesion molecules as the receptor for MHV, angiotensin converting enzyme II for SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63, and aminopeptidase N for human coronavirus 229E and TGEV [26]\u2013[30]. To date, the receptor(s) for IBV has not been identified in its native or adapted host cells. It is assumed that a mammalian counterpart on Vero cells could be used as a receptor for IBV at low affinity, and might have structural and functional similarities to the native receptor on chicken cells. At the initial stages of the adaptation process, a certain proportion of EP3 would weakly bind to this molecule and gains entry into the cells by endocytosis. In addition, binding of IBV to sialic acid was reported to be important for adaptation of the virus to human cells [31], [32]. The Beaudette strain of IBV was also reported to have an additional binding activity to heparin-like structures [33]. These additional binding activities may help to initiate infection and thus allow the virus to adapt to the new host receptor by mutation.",

Membrane fusion mediated by coronavirus, similar to other viruses, is a multistep process. It includes binding of the S protein to one or more receptors, conformational changes of the protein to a fusion-active form and the actual fusion process. The membrane-fusion activity of coronavirus S protein is mainly associated with domains in the S2 region of the protein [34]\u2013[38]. In this study, we demonstrate that L857-F substitution in the S2 region of the IBV S protein confers the S protein from non-fusogenic to fusogenic. This mutation may affect one of these fusion steps and thus modify the fusion activity of S protein and syncytia formation. At the same time, the virus was successfully adapted to the cultured cells with enhanced infectivity, confirming that acquisition of membrane fusion is an important step in selection/adaptation of IBV to cell culture and may also play a crucial role in cross-species adaptation and transmission of IBV in cultured cells.",

This mutation, meanwhile, enhances the infectivity of the virus in cultured cells. The enhancement effect by mutations in the S1 region and its significance on viral infectivity was further demonstrated by cloning and expression of S gene derived from the IBV variants rescued from the full-length transcripts containing the F857-L mutation. In variants FLv3 and FLv4, additional amino acid substitutions (Q523-L and I769-V) greatly enhanced the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the L857-containig S protein and the infectivity of the recovered virus. The involvement of residues in the S1 region in the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein was also demonstrated in other coronaviruses [25]. These results illustrate the complexity of the fusion process and the involvement of multiple domains in the induction of membrane fusion. It is worth mentioning that the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of various S constructs was approximated by the degree of cell\u2013cell fusion induced in cells overexpressing individual constructs. In a previous report, we showed nice correlation between the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of two S constructs and their expression levels in the cells [39]. This correlation was also observed in this study with more wild type and mutant S constructs.",

As structural information for this IBV S protein is currently lacking [40], [41], we are unclear the overall role of this residue on the formation and stability of the six-bundle structure of the protein. Further structural and functional studies are required to delineate the precise roles of this mutation in the fusion process. Mutation of this residue to either a Ser or a Tyr showed similar effect on the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the S protein as a Phe. On the other hand, when the residue was mutated to Ile, Glu or Lys, a much lower cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the S protein was observed. Interestingly, mutations in the S1 and some distant S2 regions could compensate the effect of F857-L mutation. This may explain why S protein from several other coronaviruses, such as MHV and human coronavirus, could induce efficient virus-cell/cell\u2013cell fusion although a conserved Leu residue was found at the equivalent position [42], [43].",
