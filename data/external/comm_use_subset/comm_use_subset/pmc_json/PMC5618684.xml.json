The majority of patients with NSCLC are already in an advanced stage at diagnosis, and surgical treatment is not curative, so chemotherapy remains a mainstay of therapy 3. Therefore, novel chemotherapeutic agents are urgently needed. Combination therapy, which improves the curative effect and reduces the toxicity of these drugs, has become one of the most important means of improving survival of patients with lung cancer 4. In addition, agents with anti\u2010inflammatory activities may exert a chemoprotective effect on normal tissues against the toxic insults of chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence has verified that many inflammatory signalling pathways are activated in various cancers; therefore, inflammation plays a critical role in multiple stages of tumour development, including initiation, promotion, invasion and metastasis 5, 6. Lung cancer is associated with an inflammatory environment, and many inflammatory mediators promote the development of lung cancer 7. Meanwhile, it has been reported that activation of the MAPK pathway plays an important role in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes. MAPK signalling cascades are important regulators of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines 8, which transmit signals through sequential phosphorylation events. MAPKs can phosphorylate transcription factors or other downstream kinases that up\u2010regulate the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators of extracellular stimuli 9. There are three major subfamilies of MAPK: the extracellular\u2010signal\u2010regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal or stress\u2010activated protein kinases (JNK or SAPK), and p38 MAPKs 10, 11, 12. Among mediators, three prominent cytokines, that is tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1), interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) and interleukin\u20101 (IL\u20101), could contribute to the development of lung cancer 13. These cytokines could induce transcription factors that drive inflammation, including NF\u2010\u03baB and STAT3. NF\u2010\u03baB, which is one of many downstream targets of TNF receptor 1 activation, is an important, ubiquitous transcription factor known to regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix turnover and angiogenesis 14, 15.",

            "text": "\nBerberis is a traditional Chinese medicine. Berberine is an alkaloid that is isolated from Berberis having biological and pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, anti\u2010inflammatory, and anticancer activities, and has been widely used in human health care 16. However, there have been few reports of berberine's analogue, dihydroberberine (Fig. 1A), especially with regard to its antitumour activity. Sunitinib (Fig. 1B) is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is effective against many tyrosine kinases, including PDGFR, VEGFR, FLT\u20103, CSF\u20101R, kit and ret. Preclinical and clinic trials have demonstrated that sunitinib has potent antitumour activity against renal cell carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, breast carcinomas, NSCLC and other cancers. Its anticancer activity results from a dual inhibitory effect towards angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation. Its main adverse reactions include hypodynamia, nausea and thrombocytopenia 17, which can be attributed to megadosing. In our study, we explored the effect of dihydroberberine on lung cancer cells and investigated the synergistic action of dihydroberberine and sunitinib on NCI\u2010H460 lung carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report our novel findings that dihydroberberine decreased the effective dose of and increased the sensitivity of lung carcinomas to sunitinib.",

On day 15, all of the mice were killed, and tumours were excised and weighed (Fig. 2C). These results show that the average tumour weight with vehicle, dihydroberberine, and sunitinib treatment groups was 1.71 \u00b1 0.43, 1.22 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.88 \u00b1 0.38 g, respectively. For comparison, the tumour weight with DCS was 0.47 \u00b1 0.07 g. Therefore, while 250 mg/kg dihydroberberine and 20 mg/kg sunitinib inhibited NCI\u2010H460 xenograft tumour growth by 28.65% and 48.53%, respectively, the combination of dihydroberberine and sunitinib had a marked inhibitory effect of 72.51%. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the body weight of the mice during the experiment. The final average body weights were 23.64 \u00b1 2.59, 23.11 \u00b1 1.67, 25.59 \u00b1 2.41, and 23.42 \u00b1 1.56 g in control, dihydroberberine, sunitinib and DCS groups, respectively. The average body weights of the sunitinib\u2010treated mice increased slightly, but the differences were not statistically significant.",

In cancer, PI3K/AKT/mTOR is constitutively activated by PI3Ks (composed of p110 catalytic subunits and regulatory subunits) that catalyse phosphorylation to coordinate cell growth, cell migration and cell survival 20, 21. The MAPK signalling pathway belongs to a large family of serine\u2013threonine kinases, which include ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and forms major cell proliferation signalling pathways from the cell surface to the nucleus 22. ERK is activated by mitogenic stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters, which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and meiosis. The JNK family members are key molecules in the signal transduction of various kinds of stress, as well as in neural development, inflammation and apoptosis. They are activated by radiation, osmotic pressure, temperature and others factors 23. P38 mediates growth, inflammation and apoptosis; it has thus become a target in the development of anti\u2010inflammatory drugs 24. JNK and p38 are important regulators of inflammatory mediators, so the activation of MAPK pathways plays an essential role in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes. Our results indicate that dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib has no effect on various isoforms of PI3K, either the catalytic or regulatory subunits, and also has no effect on the downstream effectors, AKT and mTOR. Interestingly, we found that dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib inhibited JNK and p38 activation in NCI\u2010H460 cells and tumours, but had no effect on ERK. Therefore, our results indicate that DCS may be a good multitarget combinatorial drug.",

The p38 MAPKs phosphorylate and activate several important transcription factors, including NF\u2010\u03baB, p53 and ATF, which leads to the induction and release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines 26. NF\u2010\u03baB is an important signal pathway, which plays a vital role in regulating the expression of multiple genes, including pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201012, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and interferon\u2010\u03b3) 27. Increasing evidence reveals that the inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB activity may lead to alleviating the severity of inflammatory diseases 28. The activation of NF\u2010\u03baB is regulated by three major steps: phosphorylation of I\u03baB, degradation of I\u03baB and nuclear translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB 29. Therefore, measurement of the presence of NF\u2010\u03baB can indirectly reflect the activity of the transcription factor. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, our results indicate that DCS significantly inhibits I\u03baB and the phosphorylation of NF\u2010\u03baB in NCI\u2010H460 cells and tumours. It has been previously reported that an increased NF\u2010\u03baB expression is accompanied by an increased secretion of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101 and IL\u20106 30. In the present study, DCS only inhibited the level of IL\u20101, but had no effect on TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 in tumours by ELISA. The p38 pathway is also associated with the production of COX\u20102, which is an important inflammation factor that catalyses prostaglandin synthesis 31. We show that DCS inhibits the expression of COX\u20102, but has no effect on PEGES2 in NCI\u2010H460 cells and tumours based on Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Therefore, inhibition of p38 activation by DCS appears to be an inducible factor of IL\u20101 and COX\u20102 down\u2010regulation in our model system.",

The major findings of the microarray analyses were that the differentially expressed genes in DCS\u2010treated cells were associated with the cell cycle process. JNK and p38 MAPK signalling pathways are well\u2010known mediators of growth factor\u2010dependent cell survival, and tumour cell proliferation is closely related to the cell cycle. Cell cycle progression is closely related to various cyclins, cyclin\u2010dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors and certain tumour suppressor gene products. Cell cycle regulation is downstream of JNK and p38 MAPKs, and genes closely related to the cell cycle, including cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK1, cyclin E1, cyclin A2 and CDK2, were confirmed to be altered using Western blotting. Meanwhile, our data showed that DCS\u2010treated NCI\u2010H460 cells were arrested in G1 phase, which accompanied by a decline in the levels of cyclin E and an increase in the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin B1 and CDK1. Flow cytometry analysis results demonstrated that DCS triggered NCI\u2010H460 cell apoptosis. These results are consistent with the results of our signalling pathway analyses.",

            "text": "Taken together, the findings reported in this work show that dihydroberberine increases the sensitivity of lung carcinoma to sunitinib. DCS shows more inhibition on lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, possibly by down\u2010regulating p38 and JNK MAPK signalling molecules, while simultaneously inhibiting I\u03baB, NF\u2010\u03baB phosphorylation and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of p38 activation by DCS could be responsible for IL\u20101 and COX\u20102 down\u2010regulation. Regulation of the cell cycle could subsequently lead to down\u2010regulation of JNK and p38, and further reduce IL\u20101 secretion. This is the first evidence that the combination of dihydroberberine and sunitinib could be a new strategy for lung cancer treatment, and it may become a potential drug candidate.",
