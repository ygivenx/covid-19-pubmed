            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, is a highly contagious intestinal disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PEDV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus whose genome comprises five open reading frames (ORFs) encoding an accessory protein and four structural proteins [1]. Of these, the spike on the surface of PEDV mediates binding and fusion between the virus and cells. In addition, the neutralizing epitope region of PEDV (COE) has been shown to induce virus neutralization antibodies and is used as a potential candidate immunogen against PEDV [2, 3]. PEDV has caused serious economic losses to the swine industry in Europe, America, Australia, and especially Asia. Currently, commercial vaccines, which mostly include inactivated vaccines [4] and attenuated PEDV vaccines, have provided some protection, but their efficacy has been poor [5, 6]. Since PEDV causes mainly intestinal infections [7], secretory IgA (sIgA), which can bind microbes and toxins in the intestine to prevent their adherence to epithelial cells [8], is desirable for defending the mucosa against PEDV. Thus, research on vaccination inducing a more efficacious sIgA-based protective mucosal immunity is urgently needed to prevent PEDV infections.",

            "text": "Oral mucosal vaccination has the great advantage of improving practicality for mass vaccination during pandemics, along with ease of production and administration. Above all, local protective mucosal immunity which is pivotal in response to PEDV invasion is generally not induced with parenteral vaccination [9]. Induction of mucosal immunity should be focused on the interaction between the antigen and lymphocytes within the mucosa. One promising approach involves the use of live recombinant Lactobacillus which can colonize the gastrointestinal tract and compete with pathogens for mucosal binding sites [10]. Cell wall associated or secreted factors from some Lactobacillus strains can enhance innate immune responses and epithelial barrier function, modulate the intestinal micro-environment, regulate immune cell behavior, and elicit release of cytokines [11]. In addition to natural immune-stimulating adjuvants with weak immunogenicity [12] and capacity to survive the gastric acid and digestive enzymes, several Lactobacillus strains have been applied for the delivery of heterologous antigens to trigger mucosal immune responses against pathogens [13\u201315].",

To increase the bioavailability of the immunogen of interest, the addition of dendritic cell-targeting peptide (DCpep) and microfold cell (M cell)-targeting peptide (Col) to this oral Lactobacillus delivery system has been proposed. Microbial sampling commonly includes two principal mechanisms: (1) M cells, predominantly localized at PPs can transfer the antigen to DCs and macrophages for processing and (2) DCs pierce the epithelial layers to sample the antigen directly [17]. Previous studies have demonstrated that DCpep directs the protective antigen to DCs using Lactobacillus as a vector to induce the desired intestinal and systemic immune response [18\u201320]. Furthermore, M cell ligand-fused antigens have been shown to enhance the specific mucosal immune response [21, 22]. A combination of targeting to DCs and M cells simultaneously may further strengthen and improve the antigen uptake and presentation.",

Briefly, RNA was incubated with 2 \u03bcL (10 \u00b5mol L\u22121) of reverse primer for COE for 10 min at 75 \u00b0C. Subsequently, 1 mL of RNase Inhibitor (20 g mL\u22121), 2 mL of dNTP mix, and 1 mL of RevertAid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase were added, mixed gently, centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g, and incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min, and the cDNA template was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers designed on the spike gene of PEDV HLJ-2012 (GenBank Accession No. JX512907.1) are listed in Table 1. Primers named COE-F1 and COE-R1 were used to obtain COE gene without targeting peptide. Then we use COE gene as PCR template, COE-F1 and COE-R2 as primers to get COE-Col-DCpep. The reverse primer named COE-R2 contained the sequence of targeting peptides to fuse DCpep and Col with the C terminus of COE. The flexible linker (GGGGS) was inserted between the two targeting peptides and flexible amino acids (GS) were inserted between COE and targeting peptide. SWISS-MODEL was used to predict the fused protein structure [24]. After that, the COE-Col-DCpep fusion genes were cloned into the expression plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT, to generate pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE-Col-DCpep. To construct the recombinant lactobacillus strains, the recombinant plasmids were electrotransferred into L. casei 393 as described previously [25], giving rise to the recombinant strain pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393. In addition, pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE/L393, pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE-Col/L393 and pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE-DCpep/L393 were also generated and maintained in our laboratory.\n\n",

            "text": "Parenteral vaccination generally fails to induce mucosal immunity where PEDV infection is localized. Oral vaccination can stimulate a protective mucosal immune response as well as be crucial for passive lactogenic immunity [28]. A recent study suggested that successful generation of PEDV neutralizing antibodies in milk depends on oral immunization or oral exposure of sows, and that serum IgG antibody may not be a correlative immunity for PEDV [32]. IgG was dominant in the colostrum, but was decreased in sow milk with time. SIgA accounts for 40% of the total milk antibodies [33]. In order to deliver COE to the gastrointestinal tract by oral administration, genetically engineered lactobacillus constitutively surface-displaying COE was constructed as a particulate antigen for induction of immune responses and immunocyte memory. L. casei 393 can survive in bile salts or low pH in the gastrointestinal tract as well as colonize the intestines of mice and swine for a few days [34] to enhance the systemic and mucosal immune responses for orally administered antigens [35]. Constitutive expression without an inducer is generally preferred for in situ delivery of antigens by lactobacillus in consideration of productive stability and the high cost of inducers.",

            "text": "One of the essential considerations for oral vaccines is that the immunogen needs to penetrate the gut wall where epithelial cells are lined tightly, to be taken up by antigen presenting cells, which influence the immune efficiency. Antigen sampling occurs by transcytosis in the membrane of M cells, as well as in the dendrite extensions of dendritic cells into the lumen [36]. In view of this, L. casei 393 strains that expressed mammalian DCpep and Col fused separately or together with the immunogen for targeted vaccination were evaluated for their immune efficiency in mice. Theoretically, recombinant lactobacillus first adheres to the intestinal mucus competing for binding epitopes with pathogenic bacteria. Simultaneously, the recombinant Lactobacillus was guided by Col binding to the receptor of M cells to be imported into the dome area of the gut associated lymphoid tissue where DCs are present. Then DCpep allows COE to be captured by DCs by binding to its receptors. Moreover, COE fused with DCpep can be directly engulfed by DCs through their dendrites between the epithelial cells. Protective immunity can also be elicited by activated B cells secreting sIgA [37, 38] and activated T cells differentiation. DCs can present processed COE to T and B cells directly or migrate into the mesenteric lymph nodes for antigen presentation. DC-activated T and B cells can migrate to the periphery to induce specific immunity against the pathogen challenge [17]. Our data showed that recombinant strains with targeting ligands, which likely recruited DCs and M cells, promoted more rapid and stronger immune responses at the mucosal and systemic levels, compared with those induced by pPG-COE/L393.",

            "text": "In this study, COE-Col, COE-DCpep, and COE-Col-DCpep groups showed higher sIgA levels in the feces compared with the COE group, from the sixth day post immunization, and higher IgG and sIgA in the tractus genitalis from day 10 post immunization, which illustrates that in the early stages, targeting ligands can help elicit better immunogenicity more rapidly, especially sIgA levels, indicating the significance of our oral vaccine. To evaluate the effect on cellular immunity, splenocyte proliferation and cytokine levels were determined. Differential effects on specific cell-mediated immunity depend on the adjuvant dosage, Lactobacillus strains, and antigen used [39, 40]. Higher levels of Th2-associated IL-4 and Th1-associated IFN-\u03b3 in vaccine groups than those in the control group illustrated cellular immune response was induced. The trend of splenocyte proliferation and IL-4 levels indicate that targeting ligands may enhance the production of memory lymphocytes and humoral immunity (COE-Col-DCpep group > COE-Col group > COE-DCpep group > COE group > PBS group, p < 0.05). Other relevant researches also demonstrate that targeting peptides can enhance antigen-specific IgG, IgA, T cell responses [19, 21]. Of these, it is reported that the antibody levels from mice orally administrated Lactobacillus expressing antigen-DCpep, were comparable with that from mice in the group vaccinated with antigen-adjuvant (single subcutaneous injection) [19]. Another research showed that the Co1 ligand did not induce oral tolerance and the use of Co1 resulted in a skewed Th2-type immune response [21]. In addition, we evaluated neutralizing antibodies, which can neutralize the viral pathogen by binding to epitopes on antigens associated with virus neutralization. After neutralization, some parts of the virus\u2019s infection cycle were inhibited, including cellular surface binding, fusion, entry, endocytosis, and replication [41]. Neutralizing antibodies have provided a quality correlate of vaccine efficacy for many licensed vaccines [42]. Assessment of PEDV-neutralizing activity illustrated that the COE-Col-DCpep group has the best neutralization potential suggesting that pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393 may be a promising vaccine candidate against PEDV infections.",
