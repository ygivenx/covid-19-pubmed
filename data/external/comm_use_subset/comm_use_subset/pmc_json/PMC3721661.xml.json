The sequencing of the human genome together with the development of new technologies, such as gene expression profiling and high-throughput protein analysis, has provided opportunities for rapid and accurate characterization of gene expression in tissues, and for the detection of individual host genetic polymorphisms. For example, our group has recently identified consistent patterns of gene expression in the pre-treatment liver biopsies which were predictive of treatment response.11 Identification of biomarkers to predict anti-viral treatment response would provide important diagnostic reagents in the management of HCV and may allow for the development of novel therapeutics for patients with HCV infection.",

Under non-reducing conditions the molecular mass of the protein is 250\u2013300 kDa, and in reducing condition it is 64\u201370 kDa, indicating that FGL2 in its natural state forms a tetrameric complex.39,40 Based on sequence and structural analysis, it is predicted that the encoded protein is composed of two major regions, the N-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminus. The N-terminal domain is proposed to have a linear conformation due to the presence of \u03b1-helical region and several conserved cysteine residues, which can promote coiled-coil formation. The 229-amino-acid-long carboxyl-terminus consists of a highly conserved globular domain, known as the fibrinogen-related domain (FRED), that is characteristic of the fibrinogen-related protein superfamily.

A recombinant FGL2, which was generated in a baculovirus expression system, inhibited the proliferation of T cells in response to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, Con A, and alloantigens. The inhibitory effect of FGL2 on T cells was mediated through suppression of DC maturation, characterized by the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) translocation to the nucleus resulting in down-regulation of CD80 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. The suppressive effects of FGL2 were abrogated by a specific antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of FGL2, strongly suggesting that the carboxyl FRED region accounts for the regulatory activity of the molecule. The recombinant protein also polarized allogeneic T cell responses towards a Th2 cytokine profile with increased production of IL-10 and IL-4, and decreased secretion of Th1 cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2.47 In another study, it was shown that the absence of FGL2 was associated with accelerated cellular rejection in a xenotransplant model.46",

Interestingly, high levels of FGL2 were produced by a functional clone of DN T cells, but were undetectable in a non-functional DN T cell clone. Furthermore, increased expression of fgl2 in primary DN T cells correlated with their suppressive activity in vitro.

Several lines of evidence suggest that induction of FGL2 contributes to the lethality of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. First, only in susceptible BALB/cJ and semi-susceptible C3H/eJ mice is there induction of FGL2 by MHV-3.56,59,60 Of interest, BALB/cJ mice, which express high levels of FGL2, uniformly die of liver failure, whereas surviving C3H mice that express only moderate levels of FGL2 develop chronic hepatitis (Figure 2 and reference 36). In contrast, resistant A/J mice, which fail to produce FGL2 following MHV-3 infection either in vivo or in vitro, all survive and clear the virus (Figure 2 and reference 36). Second, treatment of susceptible mice with a monoclonal antibody to FGL2 prevents thrombosis, hepatic necrosis, and lethality of MHV-3 infection.36 Finally, targeted deletion of fgl2 renders C57BL/6J mice largely resistant to MHV-3.45 At a molecular level, we have defined the active serine 89 site and requirement for phospholipids for prothrombinase activity of membrane-associated FGL2;42 demonstrated that fgl2 is transcriptionally regulated by the nucleocapsid protein (N) of strains of MHV that cause lethal disease;61\u201364 and shown that the mechanism of lack of fgl2 transcription in resistant A/J mice is altered phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT)1 \u03b1/\u03b2 iso-forms.64",

Plasma levels of sFGL2 were then compared to patients with chronic HCV infection as well as patients with non-viral related liver disease (alcohol-induced liver disease). Our data shown in Figure 3 suggest that, in patients with chronic HCV infection, levels of plasma sFGL2 is significantly higher than in patients with alcoholic liver disease, patients with a sustained viral response to anti-viral treatment, and healthy controls (Figure 3). These data demonstrate that in HCV patients, who cleared the virus following anti-viral therapy and developed an SVR, levels of sFGL2 return to levels seen in normal healthy controls. Furthermore, the results show that the presence of liver disease alone does not correlate with plasma levels of sFGL2 since patients with alcoholic cirrhosis have levels comparable to the healthy controls. Taken together, these preliminary results indicate that the level of sFGL2 may be a useful biomarker of disease progression and response to therapy in patients with HCV infection.",

The data to date suggest that patients with high levels of plasma sFGL2 (>150 ng/mL) have a more vigorous form of HCV with a higher probability of being non-responders to anti-viral therapy, whereas patients with levels <100 ng/mL are more likely to respond to anti-viral treatment. This is demonstrated in Figure 4, which shows the time-course of sFGL2 levels in two representative patients with chronic HCV infection treated with anti-viral therapy. Patient 1 did not respond to 48 weeks of therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Plasma sFGL2 levels in patient 1 were very high prior to initiation of therapy, >300 ng/mL, and remained high throughout treatment and at 6 months post-treatment. In contrast, patient 2 had sFGL2 levels of less than 100 ng/mL prior to initiation of treatment; the level of sFGL2 fell within 4 weeks of therapy to levels seen in healthy controls, and levels of sFGL2 remained very low after completion of therapy.",

            "text": "Based upon the data collected to date, it has been shown that FGL2 is integral to both the innate and the adaptive immune responses. This is not surprising as FGL2 is a molecule that has been conserved through evolution from single-cell organisms such as the ameba to higher primates. We propose a mechanistic model by which FGL2 exerts its immunoregulatory effects (Figure 7). Treg cells secrete FGL2, which then binds to the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor expressed on DC. Binding of FGL2 to Fc\u03b3RIIB down-regulates immune activation of DC as indicated by inhibition of expression of the maturation markers CD80, CD86, and MHCII. This suppressive effect of FGL2 on DC was shown to be mediated through inhibition of NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation.47 DC that are exposed to FGL2 would be therefore less effective in inducing proliferation and effector function of helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Suppression of helper T cell activation and DC maturation by FGL2 could lead indirectly to inhibition of T-dependent and T-independent B cell responses, respectively. As demonstrated by our in vitro studies, FGL2 can also directly induce apoptosis in B cells upon binding to the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor, which is known to be expressed on B cells. The indirect and direct suppressive activities of FGL2 result in inhibition of the immune response against the HCV, leading to viral persistence and chronic infection.",

Disturbances in Treg cell function or number have now been shown to contribute to failure of clearance of HCV and the development of chronic hepatitis. FGL2 has been shown to be an important effector molecule of Treg cells and was demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of both experimental and human viral hepatitis. Measurement of levels of sFGL2 in plasma of patients appears to predict both the course of HCV disease and response to anti-viral therapy, and, as such, FGL2 as a biomarker may become an important diagnostic reagent in the management of HCV patients. Furthermore, the studies show that inhibition of FGL2 improves outcomes to experimental hepatitis and thus provide impetus for generation of reagents to inhibit FGL2 in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection either alone or in combination with present anti-viral agents. As expression of FGL2 has been shown to be associated with other diseases including HIV, SARS, and cancer, measurement of sFGL2 levels and development of reagents that interfere with FGL2 may have even broader applicability.",
