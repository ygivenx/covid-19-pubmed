Such support is an important precondition for successful discovery and development of MCMs for biodefense.",

Funds in support of this aim should be vested in BARDA, which develops technologies for advancing MCM manufacturing, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Biological Technologies Office, which executes innovative biotechnology research efforts in support of national security.",

R&D efforts should include a focus on creating point-of-care diagnostic tools, particularly for emerging or novel infections, as well as a strong focus on addressing antimicrobial resistance, given increasing resistance to current anti-infectives. New antibiotics and antivirals are needed, but research and development beyond traditional MCMs is critical. The Administration should continue to support efforts that aim to bring nontraditional MCMs to market. These include, but are not limited to monoclonal antibodies, bacteriophages, lysins, antimicrobial peptides, and microbiome-based products. The Administration should also continue to encourage federal scientists at BARDA and NIAID to identify nontraditional antimicrobials that qualify for fast-track approval, priority review, or accelerated approval pathways under the GAIN Act.",

These funds would enable the agency to grow and train its product review workforce; additional supplemental funds could also support FDA's ongoing regulatory scientific research efforts. Such support, in turn, would allow relevant FDA programs and offices to mobilize MCMs through the regulatory pipeline as efficiently as possible.",

With the enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA will be tasked with overseeing a new priority review voucher program designated for MCMs against high-priority pathogens deemed to be national security threats, as well as other chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents. While such vouchers may offer pharmaceutical developers an added incentive to create needed MCMs for countering biological threats, conducting expedited product reviews over the specified 6-month period (as opposed to the typical 10-month period) could present FDA with considerable product review burdens. Increased base funding to strengthen FDA's product review workforce, as noted previously, could increase the agency's capacity to conduct expedited reviews of MCMs through this new program.",

Advanced or late-stage development is the costliest phase of the MCM pipeline and historically has been a major bottleneck in bringing viable products to market. The Administration could help bridge these late-stage gaps by increasing biodefense-related MCM funding through PAHPRA and Project BioShield\u2014which are intended to cover costs associated with late-stage MCM development and procurement\u2014thereby reducing some of the risks pharmaceutical manufacturers face in bringing MCMs to market.",

The US government should create new opportunities for private-sector pharmaceutical companies to work with DoD and NIAID to translate basic research findings into investigational therapies, diagnostics, and prophylactics. The BARDA-NIH CARB-X accelerator, aimed at developing new MCMs in the face of antimicrobial resistance, is a recent example, as is BARDA's partnership with GlaxoSmithKline to develop novel antibiotics for combating both antibiotic resistance and the threat of bioterrorism. As these MCMs mature, further collaboration between manufacturers and federal entities that specialize in advanced development\u2014such as BARDA's Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or DoD's Medical Countermeasure Systems office\u2014could help ensure that they successfully transition into the appropriate commercial markets.",

The Animal Efficacy Rule allows for approval of such MCMs based on evidence from animal studies; however, researchers still lack validated animal models for several high-priority diseases. The Administration should therefore fund federal biomedical authorities to continue collaborating with partners in academia and industry to identify additional animal models for basic research on emerging and intentional biological threats.",

During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for example, the US government provided nearly 1 million doses of antivirals to affected nations through the Pan American Health Organization and pledged up to 25 million additional doses to the World Health Organization. In doing so, however, US health authorities encountered considerable challenges in establishing legal conditions with recipient nations. Assisting other countries in the control and containment of significant infectious disease outbreaks is in the United States's public health and national security interest. In this vein, the Administration should identify strategies for clarifying, codifying, and strengthening international MCM sharing protocols. Given an increasingly globalized world, having stronger national capacities to mitigate biological threats outside the United States lessens the risk of those threats gaining a domestic foothold.",
