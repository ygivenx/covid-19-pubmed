This organism is the causative agent of Gl\u00e4sser\u2019s disease in swine, a condition characterized by a severe infection resulting in polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis [1]. H. parasuis is a member of the normal microbiota in the upper respiratory tract of pigs, even in high health herds [2]. Select strains are capable of spreading to the lungs and systemic sites, resulting in disease and death in the affected host. H. parasuis is present in all major swine producing countries and results in major economic losses to the swine industry each year [3].",

Strains typically causing disease and death in pigs belong to serotypes 1, 5, 10, 12, 13 and 14, while serotypes 6, 7, 9 and 11 are considered avirulent [4\u20138]. Strains belonging to serotypes 2, 3, 4, 8 and 15 show an intermediate virulence, causing polyserositis and death in some cases [4]. Protection has been achieved with the use of formalin-inactivated bacterins [9, 10], though heterologous cross-protection against strains from a different serotype can be variable and highly dependent on the vaccine and challenge strains utilized [11, 12]. Vaccination with other members of the Pasteurellaceae family, as well as attenuated H. parasuis strains, can offer some cross-protection against virulent strains [6, 7, 13]. Subunit vaccines composed of bacterial ghosts, DNA, transferrin and other Haemophilus proteins have been evaluated, with the efficacy of the vaccines varying [14\u201318].",

A polysaccharide capsule involved in resistance to phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing has been reported [19, 20]. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of H. parasuis is involved in induction of apoptosis, adhesion to certain host cells, and resistance to complement mediated killing [21]. Some strains have been shown to produce cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) which contribute to serum resistance, as well as host cell adhesion and invasion [22]. The virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters (VTAs), a family of adhesin proteins, have also been found in Haemophilus, and a role in delaying phagocytosis has been shown [23, 24]. Two outer membrane porin proteins, OmpP2 and OmpP5, have been identified as potential virulence factors, but a direct role in pathogenesis has yet to be characterized [25]. Additional proteins potentially involved in virulence have been identified, though not completely characterized, including a neuraminidase, IgA protease, and fimbriae [26, 27]. The presence or absence of many of these factors, however, does not always indicate virulence in this organism.",

Enriched in virulence factors, signaling molecules and other bacterial components, OMV structures have been isolated from numerous bacteria, their content determined and their role in pathogenesis examined [29, 30]. Multiple functional roles have been proposed for OMV, including secretion of virulence factors, bacterial envelope stress relief, inter- and intracellular communication, gene transfer, biofilm formation and host immune modulation [31, 32]. OMV are capable of delivering their content to host cells, through fusion with the plasma membrane or uptake via endocytic routes [33, 34]. Examination of the host immune response to OMV shows that they are capable of altering production of cytokines, regulating cell-surface molecules and triggering apoptosis [35\u201338]. Researchers have explored the use of OMV as vaccines against both human and animal pathogens, demonstrating their ability to provide protection against challenge with the parental strain from which they are derived [39\u201342]. No previous studies of OMV production by H. parasuis have been reported, though examination of OMV produced by the related human pathogen H. influenza has led to identification of virulence factors, potential mechanisms for diversion of the host immune response and use as a potential vaccine [35, 40, 43, 44].",

A number of standard techniques were utilized to accomplish this goal, as experiments of this nature have been successfully applied to a number of other bacteria, though never Haemophilus parasuis. Determining the proper growth conditions under which to isolate OMV was the beginning of this process, as media and method of cultivation can have an extreme effect on protein content and yield of OMV. Examining the effect of the purified OMV on host cells, as measured by RT-PCR and cytotoxicity assays, determined the potential host response to a vaccine composed of these structures. Comparison of the protein content between the avirulent and virulent strains identifies potential virulence factors that may be packaged into OMV. The final test was an animal study to examine whether these structures protect the host from infection with Haemophilus parasuis.",

Four piglets served as non-vaccinated, challenged controls. Pigs were observed for clinical signs of systemic disease, including lameness, lethargy, or neurological signs, and were humanely euthanized when systemic clinical signs appeared or 15 days post challenge if clinical signs were not observed, at which time samples were collected and plated for bacterial burden (nasal, hock joint, serosa, cerebral spinal fluid, lung lavage).

We examined the growth of this organism with a number of liquid and solid media (BHI, tryptic soy (TS), and Casman\u2019s) before choosing BHI for our experiments. When grown in BHI liquid media, D74 and Nagasaki strains reached maximum OD600 values at approximately 2.1 and 1.3, with maximum CFU values of 2.5 \u00d7 109/ml (D74) and 9 \u00d7 109/ml (Nagasaki) (S1 Fig and Table 1). We observed an increase in extracellular structures via EM, particularly with the Nagasaki strain, when H. parasuis was grown on BHI plates, in comparison to Casman's and TS plates (S2 Fig). When grown on solid media, colonies appeared on BHI agar within 24 h and bacterial lawns were confluent within 48 h. For these reasons, we chose stationary phase liquid cultures (12 hours) using BHI media, as well as growth on BHI plates for 48 h, as conditions for examination of OMV production in strain D74 and Nagasaki. Additionally, we created a whole cell sonicate as a control condition where vesicles form spontaneously as a result of cell lysis. Bacterial preps from which OMV were isolated were diluted and plated to determine CFU and protein concentration for OMV was determined prior to density gradient separation (Table 1).",

SDS-PAGE results showed the majority of proteins from plate isolated OMV migrated to the 15\u201320% (Lanes 2\u20134 Nagasaki plate, Fig 1E) or 20\u201325% (Lanes 3\u20135 D74 plate, Fig 1B) fractions of the density gradient. Protein in the whole cell sonicate (for both strains) was observed primarily in the 25\u201330% range of the density gradient (Lanes 4\u20136, Fig 1C and 1F). For liquid isolated OMV, protein was detected throughout all of the density fractions (Fig 1A and 1D). We relied on similar protein banding patterns observed in neighboring fractions (Fig 1A and 1D, Lanes 2\u20133 and 4\u20136) to determine which fractions to combine and recover for further analysis of OMV. Recovered fractions were also tested for total protein using BCA and quality of recovered vesicles verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig 2). As can be seen in the micrographs, recovered OMV samples isolated from liquid grown cultures (Fig 2A and 2D) contain typical round structures 50\u2013200 nm in diameter, as well as some debris which may be capsular material or aggregated proteins. OMV samples isolated from plate grown cultures (Fig 2B and 2E) contain some larger spherical structures (> 200 nm), in addition to the typical 50\u2013200 nm OMV. OMV samples isolated from plate grown Nagasaki (Fig 2E) also contain a number of tube-like structures that are several micron long. Purified sonicate samples isolated from liquid grown cultures (Fig 2C and 2F) contain a mix of structures, including several large (> 200 nm), round spherical objects. Attempts at recovering the 15\u201320% fractions from liquid isolated OMV (Fig 1A and 1D, Lanes 2\u20133) resulted in minimal protein yields and TEM analysis showed a reduced number of spherical structures (data not shown). For the liquid grown D74 and Nagasaki OMV and sonicate gradients, fractions 4, 5 and 6 were recovered and used for further analysis (Fig 1A, 1C, 1D and 1F). For the plate grown D74 OMV gradient, fractions 3, 4 and 5 were recovered and used for further analysis (Fig 1B).

Sera isolated from pigs prior to bacterin immunization showed minimal reactivity to the same H. parasuis OMV preparations (data not shown).

The most abundant D74 plate derived OMV spectral values came from both outer membrane and cytoplasmic proteins (29% for both), with periplasmic proteins the next most abundant (27%). In comparison, the D74 sonicate control consisted primarily of proteins predicted to localize to the cytoplasm (47%). Predicted localization of proteins identified as OMV-associated in strain Nagasaki showed that the most abundant proteins were periplasmic (48% and 43%, liquid and plate), followed by outer membrane proteins (30% and 22%, liquid and plate).

Live Nagasaki bacteria induced transcription of all cytokines evaluated above the level of the LPS control, with the exception of IL-1\u03b2, where there was no significant difference between any of the treatments (Fig 6). Both liquid- and plate-derived OMV, and sonicate from Nagasaki stimulated the production of transcripts for the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 at levels that were similar to that of LPS or live bacteria. Only production of the chemokine IL-8 transcript was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in comparison to the LPS control when AMac were stimulated with liquid derived OMV from Nagasaki (Fig 6). Similarly, production of TNF-\u03b1 transcript was decreased (p<0.05) in comparison to live bacterial stimulation when AMac were stimulated with Nagasaki plate OMV. Transcription of IL-10 was significantly higher in AMac stimulated by live bacteria compared to all other treatments (Fig 6). These results demonstrate that purified OMV and sonicate isolated from strain Nagasaki are able to stimulate cytokine transcription in AMac to similar levels as the live bacteria in most instances (TNF-\u03b1 plate OMV and IL-10 stimulation being the exceptions). We measured the cytotoxicity of LPS and OMV using a LDH release assay and found that OMV were not significantly cytotoxic to AMac (data not shown).",

Similar tubular structures have been reported in a number of other organisms and researchers have demonstrated roles in intercellular communication, attachment to host cells and extracellular electron transport [57\u201359]. While we have not identified the purpose of these tubular structures in H. parasuis, the observed increase in production on specific solid growth media does demonstrate a role in interaction with the environment. These data indicate that production of extracellular structures in tested strains of H. parasuis are influenced by culture media, growth conditions and is strain specific.

Many of the most abundant OMV-associated proteins identified through mass spectrometry have previously been shown to be immunogenic, secreted or virulence factors in H. parasuis (Table 2). Researchers have isolated OMV from H. influenzae (also a member of the Pasteurellaceae family) and identified associated virulence factors that have homologs in H. parasuis, which are also OMV-associated [43]. These include proteins involved in heme utilization, as well as the outer membrane porins P2 and P5. We also observed strong reactivity of porcine sera from Nagasaki bacterin vaccinated pigs to purified OMV-associated proteins, confirming that these structures contained numerous antigens. The reactivity of Nagasaki-specific immune sera to the D74 OMV-associated proteins demonstrates that there are immunogenic proteins conserved between the virulent and avirulent strains. We showed that H. parasuis Nagasaki OMV were able to protect associated proteins from degradation by proteases, similar to OMV studied in other bacteria [60]. Our findings show that naturally produced OMV were better able to protect protein content than a sample consisting of artificially generated vesicles (sonicate). The ability to protect cargo from protease degradation also shows that OMV may function in extracellular secretion in H. parasuis and confirms that our chosen method is a viable way to obtain OMV from this organism. Our results demonstrated that H. parasuis OMV are comparable to OMV isolated from other bacterial pathogens and likely contribute to the virulence of this organism.",

OMV isolated from bacteria grown in liquid media had 101 unique associated proteins, while plate grown strains had 284 unique associated proteins. The majority of the OMV-associated protein spectra (>70% of NSAF values) were found in both strains when the samples were isolated from bacteria propagated under the same growth conditions. A number of proteins that were found in OMV from both strains were predicted to localize to the cytoplasm, including chaperonin GroL (HPSD74_1917, HPSNAG_2042), DNA-binding protein HU-alpha (HPSD74_0959, HPSNAG_0784), translation elongation factor G (HPSNAG_1930) and translation elongation factor Tu (HPSD74_1362, HPSNAG_1121). The number of cytoplasmic proteins associated with OMV may be the result of bacterial lysis and association of proteins with the newly formed vesicles, or may be a type of vesicle that has been recently described, an outer-inner membrane vesicle (O-IMV) which are enriched in cytoplasmic proteins [61]. It is worth noting that predicted cytoplasmic proteins in the sonicate control samples were more abundant (47% and 43%) than in any of the naturally produced OMV samples, which indicates that the number of proteins associated with OMV were not solely due to bacterial lysis. Additionally, a number of bacterial OMV have been examined in other organisms and some researchers have reported a high percentage (> 30%) of cytoplasmic proteins associated with these structures [62, 63]. Since OMV isolated from both strains were not significantly cytotoxic to porcine AMac (data not shown), it remains to be discovered what benefit, if any, packaging these proteins into OMV provides the bacteria. The high abundance of some proteins in OMV would be the result of their abundance in the outer membrane of H. parasuis\u2013thus, the proteins are included in vesicles as they are formed and inclusion is unrelated to pathogenesis.",

OMV from D74 and Nagasaki were not significantly cytotoxic to AMac, however, they were capable of stimulating cytokine transcription to similar levels as live bacteria. Thus, OMV in H. parasuis function in immune modulation in the host, a role that has been reported in other bacterial pathogens [43]. OMV derived from liquid grown Nagasaki were able to stimulate production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 to levels that were not significantly different from live bacteria. Plate derived OMV were able to stimulate IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 to levels comparable to the live bacteria. These results are in agreement with findings by other researchers in which OMV produced by H. influenzae, Helicobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas were shown to stimulate production of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 [43, 64\u201367]. Interestingly, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by AMac was not significantly increased in comparison to live bacteria for any of the Nagasaki vesicles tested (liquid, plate or sonicate). This finding is in contrast to results previously seen by other researchers stimulating host dendritic cells with OMV isolated from Neisseria meningitidis, in which significant production of IL-10 was observed [68]. This may indicate that cell types are differentially effected by OMV (alveolar macrophages versus dendritic cells), that the observed level of stimulation is the maximum for the concentration of OMV used, or alternatively, that the live bacteria are somehow able to stimulate an IL-10 response [69], but OMV does not (lowering the immune response). Further research with H. parasuis OMV and other cell types may help to determine what role the OMV may be playing in immune modulation of the host.",

It\u2019s important to note that the OMV and sonicate were delivered without the addition of any adjuvant, unlike the commercial OMV vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis. Liquid-derived OMV from strain Nagasaki also contained the fewest proteins of any of the OMV or sonicate preparations but was still protective, narrowing the list of potential candidates for use in a subunit vaccine. Our results showed that the observed protection was associated with an antibody response to specific OMV-associated proteins and confirmed that there was a significant increase in peripheral H. parasuis-specific antibody in vaccinated pigs. Importantly, in our ELISA experiment, pre-challenge sera from the single surviving control pig did not exhibit increased reactivity above that of the other control pigs, evidence that survival was not due to prior exposure to Haemophilus. The surviving control pig was derived from a separate litter than the other vaccinated animals in this experiment suggesting individual genetic background may be important in resistance to infection with H. parasuis. These results demonstrate that OMV and sonicate derived from a pathogenic strain of H. parasuis were capable of eliciting a protective immune response. This also highlights the natural immunogenic properties of OMV, as these structures were given to the host without the use of an adjuvant.",

While OMV production and host response to these structures have been studied for nearly 30 years in the related H. influenzae, no research has been performed on these subjects in H. parasuis. Researchers have examined the use of nontypeable H. influenzae OMV as a potential vaccine, discovered that OMV are able to induce cross-protective immunity in mice and are capable of diverting the host humoral response via a novel virulence mechanism [35]. Currently the preferred method of protecting swine involves vaccination with bacterin based vaccines; however, the efficacy of these are limited and cross-protection against additional strains of H. parasuis is unpredictable [11]. It may be possible to create a multivalent vaccine using OMV (or sonicate) from numerous strains of H. parasuis that can provide protection against multiple strains. Examination of OMV from additional strains of H. parasuis, as well as their effect on additional host cell types, will give more insight into the virulence factors utilized by this organism to cause disease in swine, as well as provide useful targets for inclusion into a vaccine.",
