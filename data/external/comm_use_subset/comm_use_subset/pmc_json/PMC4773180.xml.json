In China, approximately 12,772 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) resources are used, including 1,574 (12.32%) kinds of animals [4]. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia recognizes 616 kinds of medicinal materials and cut crude drugs, of which 52 are derived from animal sources [5]. Due to over-exploitation and habitat loss, the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined and are unable to meet market demand [6\u20137]. This is significant because use of TCM is widespread and growing [1,4,6\u20137].",

Medicinal materials can be purchased at TCM shops, at markets for medicinal materials, from online shops, and from many other sources. In rural areas, people may even gather medicinal materials from the wild for their own use. Many TCM drugs are also used as health foods (also known as health care products), to regulate bodily functions rather than to treat disease. As such, diverse marketing channels exist for TCM materials [9].",

The Chinese government has placed 161 wild animal species used in TCM on the Key National Protected Wild Animal List [4]. Due to the need to protect their endangered sources, a number of ingredients once used in TCM, such as tiger bone and rhinoceros horn, have also been deleted from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia in a series of revisions from 1963 to 2010 [5]. In addition, captive breeding programs and research on synthetic sources of medicinal materials have been conducted in China since the 1950s in an attempt to reduce the impact of TCM on wild populations [6]. Social marketing campaigns as strategies for changing public behavior [10] have also been instituted by a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and conservationists recently, with the primary aim of influencing and changing consumer attitudes and behaviors [11\u201314], and some studies also directed attention towards the possibility of farmed animals or other alternatives as substitutes for wild ones, such as tiger bone and bear bile [3,15\u201316].",

Furthermore, consumer preferences are known to play an important role in consumer buying behaviors in the wildlife trade [3,15,17\u201318], and thus are likely to be a significant factor in the success of many of these mechanisms\u2014particularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners).",

Therefore, while it has been argued that social marketing strategies can serve as powerful tools for publicity and education [10\u201312,20] that can change the preferences and behaviors of consumers and reduce the driving force for wildlife over-exploitation, but this is still questionable because the changes in attitudes do not directly trigger behavioral changes and there is still a gap between protection attitude and actual consumption behavior [11,21]. Indeed, despite the growing emphasis that has been placed in areas such as environmental education or community-based conservation, there is as yet little literature on the subject of human behavior and biodiversity conservation [11] and this is an important gap.",

            "text": "What little research has examined consumer perspectives on conservation of animals used for TCM in fact suggests that consumer attitudes and beliefs may undermine a number of the current conservation mechanisms. For example, existing research suggests that people may prefer products produced from wild animals because they believe that wild materials are more potent than farm-raised ones [3,16]. Accordingly, some researchers have argued that the ability of farmed animal-based products, such as bear bile, to reduce demand for wild animal products is at best limited [15]. Furthermore, while the price of TCM materials, particularly those derived from animals, is increasing [22] and this might generally be thought to increase the demand for substitutes [3,23], the ongoing and pervasive influence of ancient tenets of TCM may mean consumers are in fact willing to pay a higher price for wild products rather than buy cheaper farmed products or substitutes [15,17\u201318]. Thus if current conservation mechanisms including substitution and captive breeding programs are to be successful and social marketing efforts appropriate designed and targeted [11\u201312,20], a more in depth understanding of consumer preferences and beliefs will be an important first step toward preventing unsustainable wildlife consumption [19,24].",

This preference was most commonly attributed to a belief that TAMs derived from wild animals are more effective than materials from other sources. In contrast, only a few respondents appeared to be motivated by conservation consciousness to choose substitutes or synthetic materials. This is consistent with existing research indicating that consumers of TCM prefer products made from wild sources and believe such products are more potent [3,16].

More farmed or alternative materials were selected by consumers, indicating the better substitutability of wild materials. The degree of substitutability of varying animal materials changed following certain patterns and there was a probability for the substitution of each TAM (Fig 2). Furthermore, our study also suggests that consumers may be more willing to choose substitutes for TAMs derived from highly publicized endangered wildlife, such as tiger bone and bear bile. This is in stark contrast to arguments other scholars have made on the basis of previous research that demand for wild bear bile cannot be reduced by the availability of farmed bear bile [15].",

Our results did suggest that conservation consciousness and a desire to protect endangered animals were significant factors in the choice to adopt substitutes to wild sourced TAMs. As their conservation consciousness increased, the respondents were more likely to choose substitutes and less likely to choose wild-source TAMs (Fig 5). Thus, emphasizing conservation concerns has great potential for increasing the substitution of TAMs derived from wild sources (Fig 6). This indicates that there may indeed be a place for conservation awareness raising efforts to impact on consumer consumption of wildlife products [13,40]. However, it is important to recognize that the relationship between public education efforts and behvaiour change is complex and may require numerous engagement strategies [10,12,20].",

We observed that respondents were in fact price-conscious and more likely to choose the cheapest option available, i.e., synthetic materials. As the prices of wild-sourced TAMs increase, consumers tend to choose alternatives [18,23,41]. However, importantly, curative effects had an even more powerful, positive impact on consumer choice, which overrode price-consciousness for some respondents.",

Our study confirms the results of previous research that has documented a preference among TCM consumers for wild sourced ingredients. However, while other researchers have taken this as evidence of the fruitlessness of substitution strategies, by placing this preference within the context of more in depth data regarding consumers\u2019 knowledge, beliefs and stated preferences, our results reveal that significant potential for substitution remains. If future research confirms our finding that whilst consumers express a preference for wild products on the basis of a belief in the increased efficacy of such products, they in fact have little knowledge of and pay scant attention to the composition of the products they buy, this would suggest that there is considerable room for a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients in many of these products. Furthermore, the significant role that conservation consciousness played in the willingness of respondents to accept substitutes for wild animals, the greater willingness to accept substitutes for highly visible endangered species such as rhinoceros and tiger, and the role of the belief in the increased efficacy of wild ingredients, provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.",
