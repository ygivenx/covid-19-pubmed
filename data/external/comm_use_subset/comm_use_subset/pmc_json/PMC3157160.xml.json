R\n0 is the most widely used epidemiological measurement of the transmission potential in a given population [4]. It is a measure of initial disease spread, such that if R\n0 > 1, then the disease can invade an otherwise susceptible population and hence persist, whereas if R\n0 < 1, the disease cannot successfully invade and will die out. The concept is defined as the number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population [5].",

Few epidemics are ever observed at the moment an infected individual enters a susceptible population, so calculating the value of R\n0 for a specific disease relies on secondary methods. There are many methods to calculate R\n0 from mathematical models, few of which agree with each other and few of which produce the average number of secondary infections. Methods to calculate R\n0 from theoretical models include the survival function, the next-generation method, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, the existence of the endemic equilibrium, and the constant term of the characteristic polynomial. R\n0 can also be estimated from epidemiological data via the number of susceptibles at endemic equilibrium, the average age at infection, the final size equation and calculation from the intrinsic growth rate. For an overview, see Heffernan et al. [2].",

R\n0 is also used as a measure of eradication for a disease that is endemic, but issues such as backward bifurcations, stochastic effects, and networks of spatial spread mean that an invasion threshold does not necessarily coincide with a persistence threshold. This results in a reduction of the usefulness of R\n0. For example, it is possible that a disease can persist in a population when already present but would not be strong enough to invade. Finally, the threshold value that is usually calculated is rarely the average number of secondary infections, diluting the usefulness of this concept even further. ",
