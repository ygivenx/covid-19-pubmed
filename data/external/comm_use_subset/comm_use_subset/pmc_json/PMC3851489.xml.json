The rotavirus genome is enclosed in three concentric layers and is comprised of 11 segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA, encoding six structural proteins (VP1-4, VP6 and VP7) and five or six nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP5/6) [1,2,4]. This unique segmented nature of the RVA genomes allows for the occurrence of reassortment between different viruses during co-infection in a single cell and induction of progeny viruses with novel or atypical phenotypes [1,2,4].",

Among these genotypes, the G (for glycoprotein) and P (for protease-sensitive) genotypes for the VP7 and VP4 outer capsid proteins, respectively, are the most important and frequently analyzed for rotavirus classifications, as they possess important immunogenic epitopes that are relevant for immune protection and vaccine development [1,8]. In extensive genomic studies, 27 G and 37 P genotypes have been identified globally, with various combinations of G and P genotypes distributed across humans and animals [7,9]. The most common G serotypes of RVA found in pigs are G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11 in combination with two dominant P genotypes, P[6] and P[7] [10-12]. In calves, the G6, G8, and G10 genotypes are the major types in combination with either the P[1], P[5] or P[11] genotype [13,14].",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that the transmission of RVA can occur from animal to human as well as from animal to animal by the contribution of one or several genes to reassortants, which is often combined with a reshuffling of genes into several reassortants [15-21]. Although it is still unclear what determines RVA host range restriction, several studies using different RVA strains and different animal models have implicated at least six rotaviral genome segments in host range restriction and virulence (VP4, VP7, VP3, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP4) [22-28]. Furthermore, there are several reports of direct transmission of RVA strains containing all 11 genome segments from heterologous species in nature. Complete genome analyses of equine RVA strain RVA/Horse-tc/GBR/H-1/1975/G5P[7] revealed a likely porcine-to-equine interspecies transmission [29]. The human RVA strain RVA/Human-wt/BEL/B4106/2000/G3P[14], detected and isolated from a child with enteritis, was shown to possess the same genotype constellation as a lapine G3P[14] RVA strain RVA/Rabbit-tc/ITA/30-96/1996/G3P[14] [30]. Whole genome sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the human G3P[3] RVA strains RVA/Human-tc/ISR/Ro1845/1985/G3P[3] and RVA/Human-tc/USA/HCR3A/1984/G3P[3] are closely related to the canine RVA/Dog-tc/USA/CU-1/1982/G3P[3], RVA/Dog-tc/AUS/K9/1981/G3P[3] and RVA/Dog-tc/USA/A79-10/1979/G3P[3] RVA strains, and the feline RVA/Cat-tc/AUS/Cat97/1984/G3P[3] RVA strain in all the genome segments [31]. These reports further suggested that direct transmission of heterologous RVA strains can naturally induce gastroenteritis in a heterologous host [30,32]. However, little is known about the exact pathology of these strains in both homologous and heterologous hosts under natural and experimental conditions.",

However, increasing evidence indicates that RVA can cause viremia and extra-intestinal infections in humans [33,34]. These data suggest that RVA can escape from the intestinal lesions and routinely spread to extra-intestinal organs [33,34]. In experimental animal models, it has been clearly demonstrated that RVA cause not only gastrointestinal infections but also extra-intestinal infections [34-37], which are caused by viremia [37-40]. These experiments were performed with homologous [36], heterologous [35-38] or reassortant RVA strains [39,40]. However, there is a paucity of direct comparison data on virulence and intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity of RVA strains in their own homologous and heterologous hosts.",

            "text": "Porcine and bovine RVA are important pathogens because of their significant economic impact on the livestock industry as well as their crucial role as reservoirs for human infections [5,11,41]. Therefore, we previously investigated the causes of porcine and bovine diarrhea illnesses and characterized multiple RVA isolates from diarrheic fecal samples [11,19,20,32]. Among the Korean RVA isolated, the bovine RVA strains RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/K5/2004/G5P[7] and RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/K8/2005/G5P[7] isolated from diarrheic calves have a remarkably similar genotype constellation as the porcine G5P[7] RVA strain OSU [32]. This prompted us to investigate whether this heterologous strain K5 could efficiently infect and induce diarrhea and pathology in the intestinal and extra-intestinal tracks of its homologous (piglets) and heterologous (calves) host. To assess the cross-species pathogenicity of the bovine K5 RVA strain in calves and piglets, the porcine G5P[7] OSU-like RVA strain RVA/Pig-tc/KOR/K71/2006/G5P[7] isolated from a diarrheic piglet was also used for comparison in this study. From these experimentally infected animals, various tissues and organs, fecal and nasal swabs and blood were sampled and analyzed for morphological changes, antigen distribution using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and viral RNA presence by RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. To better understand the potential consequences of viral genetic variations on infection characteristics, the genomic polymorphisms between the porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains were compared. The findings from our study provide insight into the possible functional contributions of viral genomic polymorphisms in the virulence and pathogenicity of heterologous RVA strains.",

Following incubation, the slides were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.2). Slides were incubated with propidium iodide diluted in 500 nM PBS (pH 7.2) for 10 min at RT as a nucleic acid stain. Slides were washed twice with PBS (pH 8.0), and covered with 60% glycerin in PBS (pH 8.0), and glass cover slips. Fluorescence of the samples was examined microscopically under ultraviolet illumination (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To calculate the number of antigen-positive cells in the organs or tissues, 10 fields per section were analyzed, using a 40\u00d7 objective and a 10\u00d7 eyepiece, yielding a final magnification of 400\u00d7.

Briefly, all tissue and fluid samples from the experimental animals were individually weighed, homogenized or vortexed at a 1:10 dilution in 0.01 M PBS and were centrifuged (tissues 13 000 \u00d7 g for 3 min; fecal samples 5000 \u00d7 g for 10 min). The supernatants along with the remaining bulk samples were collected and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. After extracting total RNA from supernatants, each real time RT-PCR reaction was performed using a Rotor-Gene Real-Time Amplification system (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) and SensiMix one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Quantace, London, UK) in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL containing 5 \u03bcL of the RNA template, 12.5 \u03bcL SensiMix one-step mixture, 1 \u03bcL each of 0.5 M forward and reverse primers (final concentration of each primer: 20 nM), 0.5 \u03bcL of 50 X SYBR Green solution (final concentration: 1 X), 0.5 \u03bcL of RNase inhibitor (final concentration: 10 U), 0.5 \u03bcL of MgCl2 (final concentration: 4.0 mM) and 4 \u03bcL of RNase-free water [39,40,49]. Reverse transcription was carried out at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by the activation of the hot-start DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min and 40 three-step cycles: 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 51 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. Quantification of virus RNA copies was carried out using a standard curve derived from serial 10-fold dilutions of the in vitro transcription of complementary RNA (cRNA) amplified in separate PCR tubes. Rotorgene 6000\u00ae (Corbett Research) software was used for the calculation of the amount of rotavirus-specific RNA in the samples. The threshold was defined automatically in the initial exponential phase, reflecting the highest amplification rate. With regards to the crossing points resulting from the amplification curves and this threshold, a direct relation between the cycle number and the log concentration of RNA molecules initially present in the RT-PCR reaction was evident. By linear regression analysis of these data, Rotorgene 6000\u00ae software set up a standard curve, which enabled the determination of the concentration of RNA present in the samples.",

As expected, viral RNA copy numbers of porcine K71 strain were much lower in the fecal samples of virus-inoculated calves than those of virus-inoculated piglets throughout the experimental period (Figure 7A).

Therefore, viremia and extra-intestinal tropisms were evaluated in the sera and extra-intestinal specimens obtained from piglets inoculated with either porcine K71 or bovine K5 strains and calves inoculated only with the K5 strain. The viremia caused by the inoculation of the porcine K71 strain in piglets was detected by nested PCR at 2 dpi, and persisted for 2 or 3 days (Table 1), but no viremia was detected in the calves (Table 3). Real-time PCR results showed that viral RNA in the sera of virus-inoculated piglets were present at 1 dpi, reaching a peak at 3 dpi, and then gradually decreasing (Figure 7A). The viral RNA of bovine K5 strain were detected by nested PCR at 1 or 2 dpi in both virus-inoculated piglets and calves, and lasted to 5 dpi in piglets and to 6 dpi in calves (Tables 2 and 4). Real-time PCR detected viral RNA of bovine K5 strain in the sera from both virus-inoculated piglets and calves at 1 dpi; the copy numbers increased at 3 dpi and then decreased at 5 dpi (Figures 7B and C). Viral RNA copy numbers detected in the sera of piglets were, however, higher than that in calves throughout the whole experimental period (Figures 7B and C).

Among the 11 nucleotide changes in the gene coding regions, three were silent mutations, resulting in eight amino acid substitutions (Table 6).

Knowledge of the virulence and pathogenicity of RVA strains in different host species is key to understanding methods of prevention and control of RVA infections. Direct interspecies transmissions of RVA have been reported to occur in nature on a number of occasions [31,32,54]. However, the pathogenicity of such strains remains largely unknown in different host species. In our previous report [32], the bovine K5 strain has been isolated from a diarrheic calf, and characterized as a porcine-like RVA strain due to having the same genotype constellation as the porcine RVA reference strain OSU. In the present study, we further characterized its pathogenicity in its homologous (piglets) and heterologous (calves) hosts. In addition, the virulence of the bovine K5 strain in the homologous and heterologous hosts was compared with that of the porcine K71 strain. The porcine K71 strain was isolated from a diarrheic piglet and was identified as being an OSU-like strain with a genotype constellation identical to that of the OSU strain [11]. On the contrary to our expectations, the bovine K5 strain showed pronounced virulence and pathogenicity in the homologous (piglets) as well as heterologous (calves) hosts; piglets and calves infected with this strain had continuous diarrhea, high virus RNA copy numbers in the fecal samples, and severe and large histopathological lesions in the small intestinal mucosa. As expected, however, the porcine K71 strain had severe virulence and pathogenicity in piglets, but not in calves. When RVA cross the host species barrier, this is usually a dead-end infection since the virus is not able to properly spread in the new host species. However, if the interspecies transmitted virus is able to reassort with RVA inherent in that host species, the resultant reassortant strains may have a higher probability to efficiently infect and spread among the population of the new host [5,25,54,55]. On the contrary to this general belief, our results highlight the existence of different enteropathogenic virulence depending on the strains, even among those with the same genotype constellation in nature. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the virulence and host range restriction of a particular RVA strain in its homologous and heterologous hosts.",

Simian RVA strain RRV and lapine strains share similar VP4, VP7 and NSP1, which have been implicated in host range restriction, and the simian RRV strain has been shown to replicate efficiently and to transmit horizontally in a rabbit model [56]. Therefore, it is possible that the possession of these three related genes may confer RRV the ability to replicate efficiently in rabbits [56]. Genetically, human DS-1-like strains are believed to have a common origin with bovine RVA strains because they share the same genotypes of six genomic segments (VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP2, and NSP4) [5]. Moreover, DS-1-like strains have been shown to successfully infect cattle [57,58], but not piglets [26]. On the contrary, the virulent human RVA strain Wa has a similar genomic constellation to those of porcine RVA, i.e., only the VP7, VP4, and VP6 genotypes are different with the porcine RVA strain OSU, VP7, VP4, and NSP1 with the porcine RVA strain Gottfried, and VP7, VP4, VP6, and VP2 genes with the porcine RVA strain A131 [5]. Moreover, the human RVA strain Wa induces diarrhea and pathology in the small intestine of piglets [38,59]. Based on these genomic and pathological properties, it has been speculated that human Wa-like RVA strains could have a common origin with the porcine Wa-like strains [5]. In the present study, both the bovine K5 and the porcine K71 RVA strains shared the genotype constellation with porcine RVA strain OSU, and induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology in piglets. In calves, however, the virulence of both strains was different; the bovine K5 strain induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology, but the porcine K71 did not. It is still unknown why the genetically nearly identical porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains had different virulence in calves. Interestingly, the human Wa-like strain D can also infect and induce mild disease in calves [5,57]. Like the human Wa-like strain D, the bovine K5 strain showed virulence not only in piglets, but also in calves.",

These unique mutations between the two strains may be possible candidates for virulence determinants in the heterologous host (Table 6). Since little information is available about the key virulence determinants (mutations) responsible for virulence and pathogenicity of RVA in a heterologous host, it is still uncertain whether the increased virulence and pathogenicity of bovine K5 strain in the heterologous host (calves) is induced by any single substitution in a certain gene or by a combination of these substitutions. Furthermore, three amino acid substitutions in VP1, VP3 and VP4, and one nucleotide substitution in the 3\u2032 UTR of K5 were found to be unique in comparison with other porcine and bovine RVA reference strains. Since the virulence and pathogenicity in the heterologous and/or homologous hosts of these porcine and porcine-like bovine RVA reference strains has not been tested, it is still uncertain whether the increased virulence and pathogenicity of bovine K5 strain in the heterologous host (calves) are induced by the observed substitutions. Therefore, the molecular and biological properties of each genome segment, and its possible association with host range restriction and/or virulence will be needed to be clarified in further studies, using reverse genetics to swap individual genes of these viruses or introduce particular mutations. The exact mechanisms of how the bovine K5 strain acquired these specific mutations are unknown. The mutations of strain K5 could have been acquired by serial replication in vivo in calves, or alternatively, the mutations of strain K5 could have occurred during serial replication in vivo in piglets, and subsequently have been transmitted to calves.",

To address this point, we sequentially collected serum and extra-intestinal organs and tissues from piglets and calves inoculated with the bovine heterologous strain K5. Both piglets and calves inoculated with the K5 strain showed similar dynamics of viral RNA in the sera and extra-intestinal organs and tissues. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpi and its concentration reached a peak at 3 or 5 dpi, and then gradually decreased. Viral antigen was detected in these extra-intestinal organs and tissues where degeneration and/or necrosis of the corresponding parenchymal cells were observed.

In addition, non-synonymous mutations of bovine K5 strain compared with those of porcine homologous K71 strain may contribute to virus replication ability, virulence, and pathogenicity in the heterologous host (calves). These preliminary observations contribute to our understanding of RVA infection in homologous and heterologous hosts. To further clarify the molecular and biological properties of each genomic segment associated with host range restriction and/or virulence, a combination of standard biochemical and molecular tools, together with the experimental inoculation studies with many heterologous strains in their natural homologous and heterologous hosts and new technologies such as reverse genetics system, will be required.",
