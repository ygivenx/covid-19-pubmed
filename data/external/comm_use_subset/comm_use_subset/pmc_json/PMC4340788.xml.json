No causative microorganism was identified. Despite rapid clinical improvement, chest X-ray showed persistent interstitial changes (Figure 1A). A subsequent high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) revealed marked lung damage suggestive of bronchiectasis with peribronchitis, fibrotisation, subpleural cystic remodeling (honey-combing) and emphysema (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pulmonary function tests showed normal vital capacity, total lung capacity as well as diffusing capacity (Table 1).

After 6 months a stable finding was documented via HRCT and no clinical symptoms were present. The EBV viral load remained low in peripheral blood. Minimal presence of the virus was seen in repeated BAL. However, the serological signs of active EBV infection persisted and no EBNA antibodies were detected at the follow up. No lymphoproliferation was present and the patient remained asymptomatic. The condition was classified as persistent EBV viremia accompanied by an atypical serological response. Molecular genetic testing of SH2D1A was carried out. A normal result excluded X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, the most common inborn cause of abnormal immunological reaction to EBV infection.

In the recently published cohort of 57 patients treated at the National Institute of Health (NIH, Bethesda, USA) [9] 70% of the patients had severe viral infections, particularly infection with HPV (63%) presenting with recalcitrant warts, condylomata, and/or dysplasia. Severe herpesvirus infections were present in 35% of patients: recurrent herpes stomatitis, esophagitis, genital infection, severe varicella in 11% of cases, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia or disseminated disease. Interestingly, in 11% of patients persistent EBV viremia similar to our patient was documented; in 2 patients EBV-positive skin tumors occurred. Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria was seen in 53%, severe bacterial infection was observed in 49% and severe invasive fungal infection in 16% of the patients. Eighteen percent of patients showed no increased susceptibility to infection. Additionally, vascular/lymphatic defects (venous thrombosis, lymphedema), sensorineural hearing loss, miscarriages and hypothyroidism were found [1-9].",

The infiltrated and fibrotic tissue decreased the elasticity of the lung parenchyma, however, there was still enough normal tissue that kept the static volumes and transfer factor normal (Table 1). Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare our findings with other pediatric patients as the data on pulmonary infliction in children are scarce. There were 24 children in the NIH cohort. Data on the pulmonary function tests were presented for only 6 of them (median age at testing 16 years, range 12\u201317 years; median time from disease manifestation 2.5 years, range 0\u201316 years). All those children suffered from myeloid malignancy, in four of them a chronic infection with herpesviruses or mycobacteria species was documented. Mild to severe diffusion defects were found in all tested patients, in two children a bronchial obstruction was seen. No information on structural lung changes in the affected children was provided [9].",

As the patient presented with serological signs of acute EBV infection whereas the pulmonary changes were chronic, a decisive role of EBV in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary tissue changes in our patient was improbable. Possibly repeated mild infections in an environment of impaired regulation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthetase expression [13], defective phagocytosis and impaired GM-CSF signaling in pulmonary macrophages [14,15] played a role in the pathogenesis of the chronic pulmonary inflammatory changes.",

Similarly, the defective antibody response at more advanced stages is associated with B cell lymphopenia [8,9]. However, with regards to the possible oligogenic etiology of immunodeficiency in GATA-2 deficiency, impact of other genes implicated in EBV control should be considered. We have excluded only the most common syndrome \u2013 X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1 caused by a defect in an adapter protein SAP, involved in signalling of cell-cell interactions. Other molecules implicated in EBV control encompass for example: the ubiquitously expressed XIAP with both antiapoptotic function and multiple signalling pathway connections; the surface molecule CD27, important for intercellular communication; the NK cell activating receptor for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (CD16), and minichromosome maintenance 4 (MCM4) crucial for NK-cell function; or IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), coronin1A, serine-threonine kinase (STK)4 and magnesium transporter, MAGT1, indispensable for T-cell receptor signalling and T-cell homeostasis [16].",
