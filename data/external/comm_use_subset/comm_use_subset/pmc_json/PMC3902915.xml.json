            "text": "Viruses are renowned for their ability to mutate and rapidly adapt to new environments. Recently, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has risen dramatically in virus discovery and the identification of emerging pathogens (1\u20133), the characterization of the human virome (4), the analysis of established infectious agents (5,6), the quality control of live attenuated viruses (7,8) and to understand the mutant spectra of viruses. NGS can be used to discover and characterize both homologous (9) and non-homologous recombination (10). Viral recombination generates considerable genetic diversity and plays a central role in the evolution and emergence of new viruses (11). Recombination can reshuffle single mutations that originally occurred on different, but homologous, viral genomes, resulting in the accumulation of advantageous mutations or the removal of deleterious ones. Homologous recombination between co-infecting viruses may also result in the evolution of new virus strains, as was observed among picornaviruses including human rhinoviruses (12) and between vaccine-derived polioviruses and circulating enteroviruses (13).",

Defective genomes evolve during persistent and acute infections in cell culture (14) as well as during wild infections (15,16). The evolution of defective genomes was proposed to be critical in the transition of acute to chronic viral infections (17) and was found in patients persistently infected with measles virus (18), dengue virus (19) and hepatitis C virus (20). Virus-to-host recombination events are relatively rare as compared with intra-viral genome recombinations; however, such events may have important biological consequences such as the selective advantage conferred to hepatitis E virus on insertion of a 171-nt fragment from human S17 ribosomal protein mRNA (21).",

ViReMa is compatible across a number of sequencing platforms that produce either long (e.g. 454 technologies) or short (e.g. Illumina) reads and can work with a variety of viral genomes (DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, multi- or single partite, short or long, etc). ViReMa does not require any pre-treatment of the original dataset beyond standard quality-filtering and does not require any special reference library generation. In addition to single recombination events, multiple recombination events within a single read are detected, as are virus-to-host recombination and insertion and substitution events. Using ViReMa, we demonstrate that by mapping the distribution and frequency of recombination events in the genome of flock house virus (FHV), we can discover de novo functional genomic motifs required for viral replication and encapsidation.

An additional 2-h nuclease digestion was performed with 20 U DNase I and 0.5 ug RNase A in between the two sucrose gradient spins to remove any contaminating non-encapsidated RNA or DNA. After the final sucrose gradient, RNA was extracted using standard phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitated and re-suspended in pure water.

Consequently, Bowtie will report the locations of a successfully mapping seed regardless of the number of mismatched nucleotides that follow it. These mismatches are reported in the 13th field of the standard sequence alignment map (SAM) output (28). For example, a 75-nt read that successfully aligns to a reference sequence but with only one mismatch might report \u2018MD:Z:45C29\u2019 in this field. However, a 75-nt read that maps over a recombination junction might read: \u2018MD:Z:45C0G0G0C0C0G3G0A0G0G0A0T0C0C0A0A1T0T0T1A1G0T0C1\u2019. From this, we can determine that the first 45 nucleotides from the read have been successfully aligned, but the remaining 30 nucleotides are predominantly mismatched to the reference sequence. (Note that the CIGAR string will still read \u201875M\u2019.) The first 45 aligned nucleotides thus correspond to the 5\u2032 region of a putative recombination junction up until the recombination breakpoint.

However, these mismatches cannot occur in the nucleotides immediately preceding or following a putative recombination event (\u2018\u2013X\u2019 parameter in command line). This ensures confidence in the discovery of a recombination junction while allowing maximum sensitivity of the segment mapping. This also prevents a segment from mapping beyond the true recombination junction by claiming mismatched nucleotides at this location.

However, deep-sequencing reveals a far richer distribution or quasi-species of defective genomes than has previously been observed using standard molecular cloning and polymerase chain reaction techniques. To see which regions of the FHV genome were retained during passaging, we plotted the frequency with which every nucleotide was excised among all of the detected recombinant RNAs. This reveals conserved regions of the viral genome. As can be seen in Figure 4, the two genomic RNAs show conservation of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-UTRs and some short internal motifs. There are three conserved regions in FHV RNA 2: nt 1\u2013248, nt 520\u2013725 and nt 1235\u20131400; and three conserved regions in FHV RNA 1: nt 1\u2013300, nt 1105\u20131248 and nt 2308\u20133107. These observations correlate well with previous studies that have demonstrated the necessity for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-UTRs for efficient RNA replication (31\u201335). Similarly, a short motif is present in RNA 2 at nt 186\u2013217 that forms a bulged stem loop and acts as a signal for RNA 2 packaging into virions (36). We would observe conservation of this packaging motif, as we only sequenced encapsidated RNAs. The internal regions at nt 538\u2013616 in RNA 2 and at nt 68\u2013205, nt 1227\u20131243 and nt 2322\u20133011 in RNA 1 have also previously been demonstrated to contain sequence motifs that are required for replication (31,33,37). The fact that we find all of these previously described motifs to be so well conserved in our analysis confirms their necessity for replication and packaging.

In contrast to these packages that extract individual segments of a pre-determined length and position from a read, ViReMa provides a unique approach by dynamically generating moving segments for alignment. After an initial seed-based alignment, a new read segment is obtained from any unaligned nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the read. Alternatively, if a mapping cannot be found, the seed position is adjusted by trimming a single nucleotide from the beginning of the current segment. Consequently, ViReMa provides a highly sensitive and versatile platform for recombination discovery and it is not limited to specific reads lengths and it can handle reference genomes of any size. ViReMa is also capable of detecting multiple recombination events within a read, insertions and substitutions as well as more complex recombination events where they may be a small number of inserted nucleotides between recombination junctions.",

In our analysis of over 31 million reads, >2.35 million recombination events were detected, 180 075 recombination events could not be unambiguously identified and <11 000 reads could not be mapped. Owing to artifactual recombination events that inevitably creep into cDNA-sequencing libraries (38), such an exhaustive search prompts consideration of the handling of false-positive recombination events. Many recombination detection algorithms are focused on the detection of splice-junctions in eukaryotic mRNA or in the detection of chromosomal rearrangements or fusions in the DNA of tumorigenic cells. These programs implement strict noise-reducing filters to remove any potential false-positive hits and any putative junction must be confirmed by the presence of multiple aligning reads or by paired reads that span a recombination junction. This is suitable in cases such as eukaryotic RNA splicing, as there should be only one or a limited number of biologically correct fusion junctions and as these junctions are likely to contain canonical splicing site consensus sequences.",

As many thousands of genome copies may be generated in a single replication cycle and as a deeply-sequenced viral genome will contain reads derived from a large pool of viral quasi-species, we should expect to find a wide range of possible recombination sites. Moreover, the mechanisms of DNA or RNA recombination may vary between species. For example, RNA template switching has been shown to occur most frequently in AU-rich regions of the brome mosaic virus RNA genome (39), whereas poliovirus has been demonstrated to favor GC-rich tracts (9). Consequently, we cannot exclude events based on the sequence information alone. Therefore, suitable controls must be used to obtain a base-line rate for artifactual recombination during the generation of the cDNA-sequencing libraries. This can be achieved by comparing the recombination in the viral genome with non-viral templates such as in vitro transcribed RNA. Similarly, artifactual recombination can be directly detected by mixing separate samples before cDNA library generation (9).",

In principle, the approach laid out here would be possible even without knowledge of the genome sequence of the virus, as this can be assembled de novo from the sequence dataset (3). Also, the sample would not need to be purified as with sufficient sequencing read depth, the non-viral sequence reads can be removed computationally to reveal just the relevant virus data (40). We are constantly facing the threat of emerging pathogens, as exemplified by recent coronavirus and influenza virus outbreaks. It is therefore critical to develop methodology that allows researchers to quickly identify and characterize important features of a viral genome while only having available limited knowledge or means to study an outbreak virus.",
