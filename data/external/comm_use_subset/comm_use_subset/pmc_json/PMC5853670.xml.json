In the final step, the beads were washed 4 times with buffer A and 1 time with phosphate buffered saline using a vacuum manifold before measuring luciferase activities using the Renilla luciferase assay system substrate (Promega). VP40 positivity was determined if the relative luciferase signal postimmunoprecipitation was at least 3 standard deviations greater than the background signal, as determined from an average of 8 previously identified negative serum samples. Positive controls were obtained from human convalescent patient sera collected during the 2014 Boende, DRC, EBOV outbreak [16].

The pseudotypes contained in the culture supernatant were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation for 1.5 hours at 4\u00b0C and 27000 rpm in a SW-28 rotor and the viral pellet resuspended in 1/100 volume of Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (HBSS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The pseudotype virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Pseudotype viruses were titered on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to determine the volume required to yield 104 RLU luciferase activity in cell lysates 48 hours postinfection. Two pseudotype virus neutralization assays were performed as previously described [21]. Pseudotype virus was incubated with serial dilutions of sera (1:50, 1:250, 1:1250, 1:6250) before infection of RD cells. All infections were completed in duplicate wells and each plate contained identical controls, including uninfected cells, cells infected in absence of serum, and cells infected in presence of negative control serum (US donor) or positive control serum from a recent, confirmed Ebola survivor. Infection rates in presence of human serum samples were expressed as percentage of infection in presence of negative control serum. To determine neutralizing capability, serum from the patients had to at least neutralize approximately 50% of virus compared to appropriate control.",

The virus/sample mixture is then incubated with cells, and nonneutralized virus infects cell monolayers. The antibody titer can be calculated by comparing the number of virus plaques in each sample dilution well to the virus-only control wells (no test sample). Samples were serial diluted (1:2) in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) over a range of 1:30 to 1:10240, mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio with the C05 isolate of Ebola Makona and either complement (Cedar Lane Labs standard guinea pig complement) or media and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Following incubation, 300 \u00b5L of virus/serum inoculum was added to triplicate wells of a 6-well plate containing 90%\u2013100% confluent Vero E6 cells and rocked every 15 minutes for 1 hour. Following incubation, 2 mL of overlay (1.25% Avicel in minimal essential media) was added to each well before incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 8 days. After incubation, the overlay was removed, and the cell monolayers fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature with 1 mL of a 0.2% crystal violet solution in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. The plates were washed with tap water and dried, and the total number of plaque forming units (PFUs) were counted and recorded for each well. An anti-Ebola virus antibody from IBT Bioservices (#01-0004) was used as a positive control for each assay. The PRNT50 was calculated by identifying the first dilution with 50% or 80% fewer plaques compared to the average number of plaques observed in virus-only wells.",

However, in addition to GP, NP or other viral proteins could individually or synergistically constitute effective targets for future vaccine therapy [26].

Additionally, these data represent the longest documented serological response to individual recombinant Ebola viral proteins (GP, NP, and VP40) and live EBOV. Until now, the longest duration of antibody responses to EBOV infection measured had been 11 years [9], thus our study provides evidence that antibody responses against EBOV can be long-lived and extend significantly further beyond known filovirus infections than previously documented. While the number of available survivors from this outbreak is limited, this is the only study to our knowledge that examines long-term immune response to EBOV in survivors on this time scale.",

These findings are comparable to an earlier study of serological responses to the related Sudan Ebola virus (EBOV-S), suggesting that VP40 appears to be less commonly immunogenic than GP or NP [27]. As a gold standard, live EBOV neutralization was measured using a PRNT to determine if these EVD survivor samples could neutralize actual virus in vitro 40 years after infection. Four (29%) survivors had anti-Ebola neutralizing titers, 2 of which also demonstrated strong neutralization using the pseudovirus assay. As noted, the PRNT curve for ES-12 is atypical, raising the possibility that the mode of neutralization for this particular survivor may not be EBOV specific, but rather nonspecific inhibition. Of the 4 survivors with neutralizing antibodies, all reacted to viral protein GP, with survivors 4 and 8 being considered strongly reactive, and survivors 12 and 13 considered mildly reactive. Three survivors reacted strongly to NP (ES-4, 8, and 13), with one PRNT neutralizer showing no response to this recombinant protein.

More work will be necessary to accurately assess the best measures for predicting neutralization, as there is variability in neutralizer response to GP, NP, and VP40. However, as an initial screen, those who are NP and GP reactive appear more likely to neutralize the virus in downstream applications. Given that within this study cohort, the majority of survivors react at least mildly to GP, yet are unable to neutralize may indicate that GP response is not necessarily the best indicator of downstream neutralization. Additionally, 1 of the strongest PRNT neutralizers had extremely low response to GP, yet high responses to NP and VP40. However, it is also important to note that protective antibodies are not necessarily always neutralizing using in vitro assays [29], and leads to the possibility that in vivo, our survivor cohort may all be protected from reinfection, because there have not been documented cases of reinfection with EBOV.",

However, these results agree with previous studies, which have found known survivors harboring detectable antibodies against viral proteins or full virus antigen [9, 10, 27]. Interestingly, survivor ES-8, whose sera demonstrated the greatest ability to neutralize live virus, was the only health-care worker enrolled in our study, indicating that these types of individuals should be investigated in greater depth during future research. Questionnaire data from this individual indicated multiple exposures to Ebola during the outbreak, with percutaneous exposure as well as contact with patient bodily fluids. The high levels of immunoreactivity seen in other individuals may also be the result of re-exposure through asymptomatic, endogenous, or sylvatic sources in an endemic region [25, 30, 31], although as mentioned, human reinfection with EBOV has not been documented. Another possibility is that related viruses may also stimulate EBOV humoral immunity, enabling this continued protective response observed in some survivors [27]. Alternatively, these individuals may have inherent genetic or regulatory differences that enable them to retain EBOV response and neutralization capabilities long after initial infection, whereas others lose this ability at a more rapid rate. Irrespective of mechanism, these survivors with specific, potent, and enduring immunological responses may guide beneficial research in preventing or treating EVD in inevitable future reoccurrences.",
