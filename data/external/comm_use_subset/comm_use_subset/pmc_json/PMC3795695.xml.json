Additionally, HAdV vectors are widely used for the study of cellular processes, and are chosen as gene and vaccine delivery vehicles for clinical use. A shortcoming of HAdVs in therapy for human diseases is their intrinsic tendency, as with infection by naturally occurring HAdVs, to induce innate immune responses and inflammation [2,3]. One potential mechanism for HAdV induced inflammation can be found in the process of viral entry, in which cellular components involved in viral internalization directly induce subsequent inflammatory gene expression by infected cells [4\u20137]. Therefore, to understand basic mechanisms of HAdV induced inflammation, and to mitigate complications of adenoviral gene therapy, it is important to understand modes of HAdV entry into various cell types.

            "text": "Endocytosis is a multi-step process that involves internalization of macromolecules and particles into specific transport vesicles derived from a cell\u2019s plasma membrane. Clathrin mediated endocytosis is a well studied endocytic pathway used by both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [8].The cell surface is abundantly endowed with other components that allow detection and response to external stimuli. Lipid rafts represent one of the major constituents of the cell membrane, contain a heterogeneous population of proteins, and act as centers for downstream cell signaling. Caveolae are a special type of lipid raft that by electron microscopy appear as uncoated, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, and are responsible for uptake and efflux of cholesterol esters. Caveolar, lipid raft mediated endocytosis plays an important role in cell adhesion and growth [9,10]. Caveolins are the major integral membrane protein of caveolae [11] and include three types with a similar molecular weight of 22 kDa [12,13]. Caveolin-1 and -2 are found in most cell types, while caveolin-3 is present only in muscle cells. Knockout of the gene for caveolin-1 in mice also reduces caveolin-2 expression, and leads to loss of morphologically defined caveolae [14]. Caveolae-like structures were identified as possible pathways of viral entry for SV40 in 1989 [15], however, SV40 entry via caveolae was recently disputed [16]. In addition to SV40, caveolae and lipid rafts have been implicated in the entry of filovirus [17], human enterovirus [18], echovirus [19] and human immunodeficiency virus [20,21], among others [22\u201326]. Importantly, the specific means of host cell entry by viruses appears to be dependent on the type of cell and its state of activation, and may be redundant [27,28].",

For adenoviruses, viral attachment to specific integrins activates PI3K which in turn activates the small GTPases, Rac and Cdc42 [34] . Inhibition of cell signaling can drastically reduce virus infection [35,36]. SV40 entry is regulated by at least five different kinases [37]. Virus attachment to cells can induce lipid raft formation by clustering of specific surface proteins and lipids. Interestingly, many viruses bind glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and gangliosides, associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and this may lead directly to activation of cellular kinases [30], adding to increasing evidence that virus binding to lipid rafts specifically initiates intracellular signaling.

Initial binding is followed by a secondary interaction between the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif in the viral capsid penton base and cellular integrins \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, and \u03b1V\u03b21 [42\u201345] This secondary interaction is thought to induce a host cell signaling cascade resulting in clathrin mediated endocytosis [46\u201348], and possibly, activation of the rab5 dependent classical endosomal pathway [49]. Herein, we show that HAdV-D37, an etiologic agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, enters primary human corneal fibroblasts predominantly via lipid rafts and caveolae, suggesting both redundancy and cell specificity in mechanisms of adenoviral entry.

Individual confocal image slices were loaded to measure co-localization pixels (Amira 5.2.2) in cells (green: caveolin-1 or LAMP1, a late endosomal marker associated with conventional endosomes [51], red: Cy3-labeled HAdV-D37). In human corneal cells, Cy3-labeled HAdV-D37 co-localized to a greater degree with caveolin-1 than with LAMP1 (p=.0068), while in A549 cells HAdV-37 predominantly co-localized with LAMP1 (p=.0025), indicating an entry pathway other than caveolae (Figures 1A and B). HAdV-C2, not known to infect the cornea, failed to infect corneal cells in culture, and in A549 cells co-localized predominantly with caveolin-1 (p=.02). (Figures 1A and B). Cholera toxin B subunit (CTXB) has been used to track and identify lipid rafts. To further examine the role of lipid raft microdomains in HAdV-D37 entry, we treated corneal cells with both Cy3-labeled virus and 488-CTXB, and tracked their cellular localization over time (Figure 1C). Co-localization of virus and CTXB was observed in the cell membrane at 30 min, cytoplasm at 60 min, and perinuclear region at 90 min, supporting a role for caveolin-1 and lipid rafts in HAdV-D37 entry into corneal cells.",

Earlier studies showed an essential role for both integrins and Src kinase in HAdV entry [31,35,45,46,52]. Therefore, control pretreatments also included an RGD-containing 15-mer (50 \u03bcM) designed to match the amino acid sequence in the HAdV-D37 penton base (DAVP(RGD)NYASAAEA) [53,54], in order to block integrin aggregation, and its KGE-containing 15-mer control (DAVP(KGE)NYASAAEA), otherwise identical to the RGD 15-mer. The chemical PP2 (10 \u03bcM) was used to inhibit Src kinase activity. At both 30 min and 1 hr post infection, viral entry appeared nearly completely blocked by pretreatment with either M\u03b2CD or RGD, and partially by PP2, but not by KGE (Figure 2A). Replenishment of cholesterol (0.4mg/ml in 0.2mM M\u03b2CD) for 1 hr appeared to restore both normal cell morphology and viral entry, as assessed by confocal microscopy (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis of detergent free lipid raft preparations at 1 hr post infection revealed increased caveolin-1 in lipid rafts from virus infected cells as judged collectively in fractions 4, 5 and 6 (Figure 2C). Caveolin-1 was seen at much lower levels and only in the 5th fraction of mock infected cells. In cells that were M\u03b2CD treated prior to virus infection, caveolin-1 was reduced. We also observed increased phospho-Src (pSrc) in virus infected cell fractions 5 and 6. Reductions in both caveolin-1 and pSrc were observed in RGD pretreated cells, whereas PP2 pretreatment reduced only pSrc and not caveolin-1 (Figure 2C). These results suggest a relationship between caveolin-1 and Src in HAdV-D37 entry.",

To investigate the type of endosome used in HAdV-D37 entry, flotation gradient fractionation of post nuclear supernatants was performed to separate different endosomal compartments [55]. Upon viral infection, fractions 4-6 maximally expressed LAMP1 indicating the presence of late endosomes [56], while fractions 9-11 were enriched with caveolin-1, indicating the presence of caveolae (Figure 3A). When the blots were stripped and reprobed, the caveolin-1 containing fractions were found to also contain pSrc. RAB5, a marker for early endosomes [57] was observed in fractions 14-16 upon viral infection, but was not evident in the fractions expressing pSrc. We confirmed Src activation in fractions 10 and 11 using a Src kinase assay in which substrate fluorescence and kinase activity are inversely proportional (Figure 3B). These results suggest that a pathway mediated by caveolin-1, and involving Src kinase, is an important route of HAdV entry into human corneal cells. M\u03b2CD pretreatment altered the fractionation of caveolin-1, and resulted in reduced identification of endosomal markers (Figure 3A). However, we cannot exclude alternative possible effects of M\u03b2CD on clathrin mediated mechanisms, as previously shown [58,59]. ",

M\u03b2CD pretreatment reduced viral DNA content in both endosomal fractions (p<.05, both comparisons). Viruses can often circumvent artificial barriers to cell entry by use of alternate entry pathways [50,60,61]. However, in our study, M\u03b2CD pretreatment reduced the presence of viral DNA in both the caveolin-1 containing fraction and in the LAMP1 containing fraction. We also examined for the presence of viral DNA in lipid raft fractions from M\u03b2CD treated cells when replenished with cholesterol, as compared to those treated with M\u03b2CD alone prior to viral infection. In lipid raft fractions from M\u03b2CD treated, cholesterol replenished cells, E1A content was equivalent to that from cells not treated with M\u03b2CD prior to infection (Figure 3C).",

Specificity of the caveolin-1 siRNA was validated by showing expression of unrelated protein kinase C was not reduced compared to control (data not shown). However, HAdV-D37 infection of corneal cells after caveolin-1 knock down by siRNA reduced IL-8 expression by ~ 50% (p=.0001, Figure 4C). ",

By confocal microscopy performed at 30 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr post infection, viral entry, but not viral attachment, appeared markedly reduced in caveolin-1 -/- as compared to wild type mice at these time points (Figure 5A). Western blot analysis of wild type and caveolin-1-/- mice corneas after infection revealed increased pSrc in wild type corneas at 1 and 24 hr post infection, compared to caveolin-1 -/- mice, suggesting that caveolin-1 is necessary for Src activation after infection (Fig, 5B). Similarly, upon viral infection, CXCL1 protein expression was reduced in caveolin-1 -/- mice as compared to wild type mice (p=.0001, Figure 5C). These results suggest that caveolin-1 is important to viral entry, kinase activation, and subsequent chemokine expression. ",

Therefore, we applied the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 \u03bcM) to the mouse adenovirus keratitis model. When injected 30 min prior to HAdV-D37 infection, PP2 reduced corneal inflammation as assessed by histology 4 days post infection (Figure 5D) and also reduced CXCL1 expression by ELISA at 16 hr post infection (p<.05, Figure 5E), while the PP2 solvent DMSO alone did not reduce inflammation or CXCL1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest HAdV-D37 enters corneal cells at least in part via caveolae, in an integrin dependent and Src kinase mediated pathway. ",

A Caveola has a characteristic flask or bulb-shaped appearance [68\u201370], without the obvious coat of clathrin pits[ 71]. Initially, SV40 was reported to use the caveolar pathway to enter cells [15,72], but was later observed to use a caveolae independent pathway [16,60,73]. Each caveolae contains approximately 140-150 caveolin-1 molecules [74]. To confirm caveolin associated viral entry into corneal fibroblasts, we performed ultrastructural studies with and without viral infection (Figure 6). Electron micrographs of uninfected fibroblasts demonstrate abundant membrane associated vesicles, visible as flask shaped invaginations of the cell membrane (Figure 6A). Within 1 hr after HAdV-D37 infection, viruses were seen in some of these Caveola-like structures (Figure 6B-D). In some tissue sections, it appeared that caveolae were fusing to form caveolar vesicles (caveosomes) as reported earlier [75]. Viruses also accumulated in these presumed caveosomes (Figure 6D). In order to confirm that the membrane associated vesicles seen ultrastructurally are indeed caveolae, we applied immuno-electron microscopy with primary antibodies against caveolin-1 or clathrin, and secondary antibody bound to protein-A nanogold. Membrane-associated vesicles in human corneal fibroblasts labeled well with antibody against caveolin-1 (Figure 6E). Within 30 min after viral adsorption, many caveolin-1 expressing vesicles were seen to contain virus (Figure 6F). The size of the caveolin-1 containing vesicles in corneal cells ranged from ~80-140nm in diameter (data not shown). Therefore some vesicles appeared able to accommodate the ~ 90 nm diameter adenovirus. Notably, clathrin staining vesicles in the same cells were much less abundant and no clathrin staining vesicles were seen to contain virus (data not shown). These results confirm that HAdV-D37 uptake into human corneal fibroblasts occurs in vesicles containing caveolin-1. ",

            "text": "Endocytosis is used by pathogens as a gateway to cellular entry. The specific pathway of entry seems to be host and pathogen specific [76]. The most well studied mechanism of receptor-mediated entry is clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Most previous reports suggest that HAdVs use clathrin mediated endocytosis for cellular entry [77,78], with macropinocytosis as an alternate pathway [77,79\u201381]. Caveolae are ubiquitous on the surface of cells, particularly in fibroblasts [82], and appear large enough to accommodate human adenoviruses [83\u201385], which typically measure ~ 90 nm in diameter. Recently, HAdV-C was shown to utilize lipid raft mediated, caveolar endocytosis in non fibroblast cell lines [50,61]. Because of our longstanding interest in pathogenesis of HAdVs in the human cornea, we sought to test viral entry in primary human corneal fibroblasts. We used two cell types, primary fibroblasts cultured directly from human donor corneas, and as control, A549 cells, a human alveolar epithelial cell line that was previously shown to support HAdV-1 virion production [86] and commonly used for the culture of HAdVs. Our results clearly demonstrate caveolin-1 associated entry into corneal cells by the highly cornea-tropic HAdV-D37. In contrast, HAdV-D37 entry into A549 cells was less robust and appeared to predominantly involve the LAMP1 pathway. As an additional control, we also tested the entry of HAdV-C2, a non corneal pathogen, but the degree of entry into human corneal cells was too low to permit quantitative analysis. Caveolae mediated entry of another non-enveloped DNA virus, SV40, is controversial [16,60,73], and in the absence of caveolin-1, SV40 still successfully enters cells [60], suggesting redundant and alternative mechanisms. However, in corneal stromal cells, HAdV-D37 appears to rely largely on lipid raft mediated, caveolin-1 associated endocytosis. Cholera toxin B subunit (CTXB) has been shown to bind glycosphingolipid ligand, GM1, and has been used to identify distinct, lipid raft endocytic pathways [87]. In our study, CTXB co-localized with HAdV-D37 in corneal cells during entry. We show the presence of viral DNA predominantly in caveolin-1 associated membrane fractions. It is important to acknowledge that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is also sensitive to acute depletion of cholesterol [58,88] and that raft recruitment has been shown to precede clathrin-dependent endocytosis for anthrax toxin, EGFR, and BCR, respectively [89\u201391]. In our study, cholesterol depletion also reduced viral DNA in LAMP1 rich fractions in corneal cells, indicating a similar redundancy in cholesterol function. When cholesterol was replenished in cells treated with M\u03b2CD, there was a gain in entry as determined by confocal microscopy and viral DNA expression. We also previously showed the critical role of Src in HAdV infection [35,52,66,67,92]. The observation of increased Src kinase activity specifically in caveolin-1 enriched fractions in infected cells strongly suggests a role for caveosomal signaling upon viral infection. At 1 hr post infection, PP2, a chemical inhibitor of Src kinases, partially reduced viral entry, whereas both M\u03b2CD and RGD more completely blocked viral entry. Using a mouse keratitis model [63], caveolin-1-/- mice showed reduced entry of virus as compared to wild type mice and showed reduced levels of both pSrc and CXCL1 expression complimenting our in vitro data. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for Src kinase in the caveosome during viral entry, with downstream effects on chemokine expression by infected cells. ",

For example, within the polyomaviruses, JC virus enters cells via clathrin mediated endocytosis [93] and is later sorted into caveosomes [94], while BK virus uses pH dependent caveolar endocytosis [95]. Other polyomaviruses enter cells using uncoated vesicles independently of both caveolin and clathrin [96]. These studies do not account for potential differences in cell types used to determine viral entry. Our ultrastructural studies confirm the association between HAdV-D37 with caveolin-1 in corneal fibroblasts during viral entry, but not clathrin in the same cells. Our data also suggests that HAdV-D37 may utilize different entry pathways in different cell types. Time course studies with a panel of cell types relevant to corneal infection will be necessary to determine the range of entry mechanisms utilized by HAdV-D37, and to better understand the infectious and inflammatory outcome of different entry pathways. HAdV-D37 replicates readily in human corneal fibroblasts [53], and in our hands, knockdown of caveolin-1 reduced chemokine expression, suggesting that caveolin contributes to both productive infection and corneal inflammation. However, our data may be relevant only to the earliest stages of infection, and does not address possible sorting of virus later in infection to different endosomal compartments.",

Real-time PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the following conditions, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C (10 s), 55\u00b0C (20 s), and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. To determine mRNA expression for caveolin-1 and IL-8, total RNA was extracted from caveolin-1 or scrambled siRNA transfected, HAdV-D37 infected cells, at 2 hr post-infection using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was then treated with DNase I (1 unit) (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37\u00b0C for 1hr. Two \u03bcg of the DNase treated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and oligo dT15 primers (IDT). Primers for caveolin-1 and IL-8 were designed using Primer3 plus software (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi), and synthesized by IDT (Table 1). The cDNAs were diluted by 1:10 and 1 \u00b5l was used for qRT-PCR using Fast SYBR Green master mix under the conditions: 40 cycles oat 95\u00b0C (30 s), 60\u00b0C (1 min), 72\u00b0C (30 s), and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. A non-template control and endogenous control (human GAPDH) were measured for the relative quantification. The related expression levels were calculated by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method against the untransfected/uninfected controls [99].",
