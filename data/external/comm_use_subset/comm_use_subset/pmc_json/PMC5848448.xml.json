            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect most species of warm-blooded animals around the world [1, 2]. Toxoplasma gondii infection in immunocompetent adults is often subclinical and persists in the life of the host [3]. It can also cause several serious diseases, such as neonatal mortality and fetal infection, which occur in the congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients [1, 3, 4]. Manipulating the host environment is a critical step for T. gondii to establish its successful invasion and survival in host cells [5\u20137]. It injects parasite-derived effector molecules into the host cell to interfere with their defenses during the invasion [8]. Immediately following the invasion, T. gondii establishes a specialized parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the host cell cytoplasm [9]. The PV protects the parasites against lysosomal destruction and provides a residence in which the parasites can replicate within the host cells [10]. Meanwhile, the intracellular parasites can change the host biological process to maintain its persistence, such as by inhibiting apoptosis [11, 12], inducing autophagy [13], controlling the cell cycle [14] and regulating immune signaling [15].",

Thousands of mammalian lncRNAs have identified their regulatory function in various biological processes, including cell development [17], chromatin modification [16] and immune regulation [18]. LncRNAs have gained great interest for their wide variety of regulatory roles [19]. They can interact with RNA, DNA, protein or microRNAs to regulate transcription, splicing, nucleic acid degradation and translation [16, 20]. The dysregulation of lncRNA expression can lead to cell functional deficiencies that contributes to a variety of diseases, such as developmental defects [21], tumorigenesis [22] and autoimmune diseases [23]. Recent studies have shown that viral or bacterial infection can change the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the host, which indicated that lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of host-pathogen interactions, and even determine the outcome of infection [24\u201327]. Several lines of emerging evidence have demonstrated that small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs) are involved in the host-T. gondii interaction [28\u201331]. However, the role of lncRNAs in the response to the Toxoplasma parasite is still unclear.",

The lncRNAs were found to be involved in the expression of several genes coding for immune-related proteins, including LTA, IL17C and UNC93B1 (Fig. 3e). The additional co-expression network of lncRNAs and immune-related genes, such as IL-17RA, LST1, TNFRSF14 and AIF1, are shown in Additional file 6: Figure S1. For example, 39 lncRNAs, including NONHSAT144418, were positively correlated with the expression of the LTA gene, which encodes a protein of the tumor necrosis factor family; and 4 lncRNAs, including NONHSAG006167, were negatively correlated with the Il 17c gene coding for the cytokine IL17C that is restricted to activated T cells. Interestingly, we found that UNC93B1, which has been identified as one of the critical immune-related molecules in mediating the host defenses against T. gondii infection [35, 36], was correlated with a novel lncRNA, NONHSAT022487 (Fig. 3e). Additionally, the co-expression network analysis suggested that lncRNA NONHSAG006167 may be involved in the regulation of UNC93B1-related immune signaling.",

Since apicomplexans can only propagate within host cells, the regulatory cell biological function is critically important for their survival and pathogenesis [38]. Previous studies on the interaction of apicomplexan parasites and the host have largely focused on protein-coding genes [33, 39\u201341]. However, a number of recent studies have suggested that long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) were also involved in host-pathogens interactions [25, 27, 28, 42]. For instance, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection altered the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in the human macrophage [42]. The analysis of the host transcription following SARS-CoV infection revealed that lncRNAs were associated with the host response to virus infection and altered innate immune signaling [27]. Our study of host long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) in response to T. gondii infection provides new insight into the regulating mechanism of the host gene expression by the Apicomplexan parasites.",

Compared with the uninfected HFF cells, the expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs were profoundly altered in the T. gondii-infected HFF cells. The heat-killed parasite-infected HFF cells were used as a control to exclude the genes and pathways that were activated by dead parasites. There were redundant 392 lncRNAs and 116 mRNAs that were detected in the inactivated group compared with the uninfected group. They thus considered that the host lncRNAs and mRNAs were regulated by the dead parasites. A total of 996 lncRNAs and 109 mRNAs (fold change \u2265 5) were identified as the differential expression candidates and subsequently analyzed by GO term and KEGG pathway analysis. Interestingly, we found that the most enriched GO terms in the biological processes that targeted the upregulated genes are the adaptive immune response and the positive regulation of interferon production. However, the most enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways involved in the downregulated mRNAs are the Toll-like receptor and signaling pathways. It is believed that T. gondii possesses multiple means to down-modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [43]. One of the mechanisms for this downregulation is that T. gondii infection inhibits the intracellular signaling cascades, such as NF-\u03baB and STAT1, within the infected cells [44, 45].",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition receptors that play a central role in macrophage activation and the control of parasitic infections [36, 46]. The T. gondii-derived component profilin can be recognized by TLR11and TLR12 and induce IL-12 production that limits the cyst burden in T. gondii-infected mice [47, 48]. The UNC93B1, a multi-transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, is required for proper TLR localization and signaling in both humans and mice [49, 50]. UNC93B1 can facilitate trans-location of TLR (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi [51, 52] and mediates the host immune responses to infection with murine cytomegalovirus [53], as well as several intracellular protozoan parasites [35, 54]. A deficiency in the functional UNC93B1 protein abolished TLR dependent cytokine secretion by macrophages and attenuated immune responses against intracellular parasite infection, including Trypanosoma cruzi [54] and T. gondii [35, 36]. Mice lacking functional UNC93B1 result in the impaired production of IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and enhanced T. gondii tachyzoite replication [35, 36]. However, the role of UNC93B1 in intracellular parasite growth appears to be independent of TLR function [35].",

            "text": "Our results suggested that NONSHAT022487 can suppress the expression of the immune-related molecule UNC93B1 by lncRNA knockdown and over-expression experiments. Meanwhile, the RT-qPCR results in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that there is a non-significant difference in the expression of NONHSAT022487 and UNC93B1 between the mock and the controls. Considering that both lncRNA NONHSAT022487 and UNC93B1 are involved in innate immune responses, it is possible that their different expression maybe affected by nonspecific treatment, such as transfection with GFP shRNA and pcDNA empty vector. Our further study also demonstrated that NONSHAT022487 can regulate the secretion of the cytokines IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 after T. gondii infection. To survive successfully, the Toxoplasma parasite actively regulates the host immune response to downregulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which could be harmful to the parasite [15, 32]. For example, T. gondii infection inhibits the host cell transcriptional response to IFN-\u03b3 [55]. Meanwhile, T. gondii-infected murine splenic lymphocytes could impair the capacity of these cells to produce cytokines and immunoglobulin secretions [43]. This regulation of the host immune response is critical for the parasite to establish a chronic infection. On the other hand, the host has to downregulate the immune responses shortly after initial upregulation to control damages to self. Several lines of emerging evidence have indicated that lncRNAs function in the regulation of the mammalian innate and adaptive immune responses [23, 56]. For example, lncRNA-Cox2 has been identified to regulate the TLR signaling pathway [56], while lncRNA PACER (p50-assocated COX-2 extragenic RNA) acts as a decoy molecule in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [23]. Therefore, further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of lncRNAs in Toxoplasma infection and immune regulation.",

The secretion of the cytokines IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant of various THP-1-derived macrophage cells from before (uninfected) or after T. gondii infection (T. gondii) were assessed by ELISA. Cells were transfected with shRNA-NONHSAT022487 lentiviral plasmid (sh-NONHSAT022487), shRNA control plasmid (sh-Control), pcDNA3.1-NONHSAT022487 plasmid (pc-NONHSAT022487) or pcDNA3.1 control plasmid (pc-Control) as indicated. Data are the mean with standard deviations (SD) from three independent biological replicates. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01",
