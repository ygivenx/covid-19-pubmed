Recent viral zoonoses have led to some of the most devastating and medically relevant outbreaks in modern history, including SARS coronavirus, pandemic influenza, and HIV/AIDS, highlighting the urgent need to understand how viruses adapt to infect new species. At a population level, factors influencing the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans include increasing population density, greater contact with wildlife, increased travel, and poor public health infrastructure [2], [3]. However, these factors only allow the microbe increased access to new hosts; they do not directly enable it to adapt to and replicate in the new species. Intermediate hosts, animals that are not the natural host of a virus but are still permissive or semi-permissive for viral replication, play a critical role in cross-species transmission. These hosts can facilitate increased contact between a virus and a new host, and drive adaptive changes that may improve virus replication (Reviewed in [4]). For example, spill-over of Nipah virus from fruit bats into pigs, the intermediate host, increased human exposure to the virus and resulted in eventual human outbreaks in Malaysia [5], [6]. In another example, lentiviral adaptation through intermediate chimpanzee hosts led to both increased contact with humans, and adaptive genetic changes permitting the virus to inhibit the human versions of several host restriction factors (Reviewed in [7]).",

A subset of these proteins inhibits specific virus families, such as the restriction of retroviruses mediated by TRIM5\u03b1 [8]. However, other restriction factors, including protein kinase R (PKR), block the replication of multiple virus families. PKR is activated by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common byproduct of both RNA and DNA virus replication, followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation. Activated PKR then phosphorylates the \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), ultimately arresting translation initiation [9]. In response to the broad and potent barrier to viral infection imposed by PKR, most virus families have evolved at least one mechanism to inhibit the PKR pathway [10].",

            "text": "This conflict between host restriction factors and their viral antagonists results in an \u201carms race\u201d leading to rapid evolution of both sets of genes [11]. The extraordinarily high rate of positive selection (dN/dS) among primate PKR genes reflects the evolutionary pressure on PKR to evade virus antagonists [12], [13]. To productively infect new host species, virus antagonists must rapidly adapt to escape these differences in PKR. In the current study, we modeled the process of viral adaptation through an intermediate, minimally permissive host. We experimentally evolved a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist rhtrs1 in African green monkey cells expressing RhTRS1-resistant PKR. We demonstrate that amplification of the exogenous rhtrs1 locus was an early adaption that is sufficient to rescue virus replication in minimally-permissive AGM cells. This amplification of the rhtrs1 locus was also sufficient to expand the species tropism of these viruses, enabling them to infect both human and rhesus cells substantially better than the initial virus. Importantly, rhtrs1 amplification did not occur when the initial virus was passaged through human fibroblasts, suggesting that amplification in AGM cells was a necessary intermediate step to expand the virus host range. Gene amplification is a universal mechanism of rapid adaptation occurring in eukaryotes [14], [15], prokaryotes [16], and viruses [17], [18], enabling diverse adaptations including evasion of host restriction factors (Reviewed in [19]). Our results suggest that gene amplification in an intermediate host may be a risk factor for broad cross-species transmission independent of other adaptive events.",

However, we discovered that a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RhTRS1 and lacking both of the known vaccinia PKR antagonists, E3L and K3L, (VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1) produced 100 to 1000-fold less virus in AGM-derived PRO1190 cells relative to VV-\u03b2g (which contains both E3L and K3L) although it replicated almost as efficiently as VV-\u03b2g in AGM-derived BSC40 cells (Fig. 1A).

To test this hypothesis, we generated PRO1190 cells stably expressing either a PKR-specific shRNA (PRO1190-PKR kd), which resulted in a 56% reduction of PKR expression, or a scrambled control shRNA (PRO1190-ctrl kd) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, PKR-specific RT-qPCR demonstrated a 60% reduction in PKR mRNA from PRO1190-PKR kd cells relative to PRO1190-ctrl kd cells (2578 copies or 6503 copies PKR/ng total RNA respectively) but little difference between PRO1190 and PRO1190-ctrl kd cell PKR levels (Fig. S1). In PRO1190-PKR kd cells, VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 replication was almost completely rescued to VV-\u03b2g levels (Fig. 1C). We detected a similar increase in VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 replication after transiently transfecting PRO1190 cells with a siRNA specific for PKR, but not a control siRNA (data not shown). Sequence analysis of PRO1190 PKR identified three non-synonymous mutations relative to a previously reported AGM PKR (GenBank # EU733254) that is sensitive to RhTRS1 (Fig. S2, [20]). Interestingly, one of these single nucleotide variants is heterozygous in PRO1190 cells, and changes a residue (T577M) that is evolving under positive selection in primates [12]. Although additional studies will be needed to determine whether one or more of these PRO1190 PKR polymorphisms is responsible for increased resistance to RhTRS1, the results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the block to VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 replication in PRO1190 cells is mediated by PKR.",

After four passages we observed a 10- to 100-fold increase in viral replication that remained stable for at least three subsequent passages in each of three independent lineages (Fig. 2). We next performed a competition assay to assess the relative fitness of the passaged virus in comparison to the initial VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 virus. We co-infected PRO1190 cells with either VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 or VV-A, both of which express eGFP, and the same competitor, VV\u0394E3L+RhTRS1, which expresses \u03b2-gal (MOI = 0.1 for each virus).

We have shown that RhTRS1 does not inhibit human or rhesus PKR in the context of VV\u0394E3L [20]. To determine whether the adaptations that evolved during serial passage in PRO1190 cells affected the virus species tropism, we infected primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) or primary rhesus fibroblasts (RF) with VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1, each of the three passaged virus pools or VV-\u03b2g at an MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 3). As expected, VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 replicated poorly and VV-\u03b2g replicated efficiently in each cell type. Remarkably, all three passaged pools replicated between 1000- to 10,000-fold better than VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 in both HFF (Fig. 3, center) and RF (Fig. 3, right). For each pfu of VV-A, VV-B and VV-C used to infect the cells, 5.2, 1.9, and 6.3 pfu of progeny emerged from HFF and 40.8, 7.3, and 3.7 emerged from RF, respectively, suggesting that these viruses were sufficiently well adapted to enable continuous propagation in these cells (see below). However, these virus pools still replicated 10- to 100-fold better in PRO1190 than in either human or rhesus cells (Fig. 3, left). Thus, adaptation of VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 in minimally permissive AGM fibroblasts also provides a substantial replication benefit in human and rhesus cells expressing distantly related PKR proteins. To elucidate the underlying mechanism for this gain of fitness, we harvested DNA from passage 7 viruses for genetic analyses and then passaged the viruses once more in PRO1190 to generate viral stocks for biochemical and infectivity analyses.",

Based on read depth, we detected duplication of the rhtrs1 locus in all three passage 7 virus pools but not in VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 (Fig. 4A). Each of the passaged pools contained between 1.4 and 1.9 copies of rhtrs1 per genome, although these numbers reflect averages of a heterogeneous population of viral genomes. Confirming this estimate of rhtrs1 copy number, the frequency of reads in which we detected a recombination site near the rhtrs1 locus increased as a percentage of total reads in viruses predicted to have more copies of rhtrs1 (Fig. 4B).",

We were unable to obtain enough of the 2.3 kb band for further analysis, but we did characterize the 3 kb and 1.8 kb products by Sanger sequencing. The larger product was identical in all three passaged virus pools, and represents a recombination between the vaccinia virus gene L5R upstream of rhtrs1 with J2R downstream of rhtrs1. In the smaller product J2R recombined with the neoR gene, which was introduced as a selection marker during construction of VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 (Fig. S3C). These two sites represented the predominant recombination sites (85.5% and 2.8% respectively) identified by Illumina deep sequencing. However, we found additional minor recombination sites by Illumina deep sequencing, including a 15 kb duplication in VV-B. The presence of an identical recombination site in all three passaged virus pools suggests that duplication may have been present at a very low frequency in the initial virus population even though we did not detect it in the Illumina sequencing data. Regardless, taken together these data demonstrate that the copy number of rhtrs1 in the viral genome was substantially increased by passage through PRO1190 cells.",

None of the other mutations were detected in all three pools or occurred at >50% frequency in any pool, so are unlikely to account for the improved replication of the passaged viruses.

In contrast to infection of PRO1190 cells, infection of HFF with VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 resulted in nearly complete shut off of protein synthesis by 24 hpi (Fig. 6, top right panel) and produced only trace amounts of RhTRS1. Compared to VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1, VV-A infection of HFF resulted in detectable, though still low overall levels of 35S labeled proteins, and much more RhTRS1 (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10). PKR phosphorylation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were elevated after infection with both VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 and VV-A compared to mock or VV-\u03b2g controls (Fig. 6, compare lane 9 to lanes 6 and 7). These data suggest that a single copy of rhtrs1 was insufficient to inhibit the translational shutoff mediated by human PKR, but amplification of this weak antagonist resulted in partial inhibition of human PKR allowing enough protein synthesis to support a modest level of virus replication.",

We therefore serially infected PRO1190 cells and HFF with VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 in parallel (Fig. 7). In PRO1190 cells, viral fitness again increased after four passages.

We therefore serially infected HFF with VV-A, VV-B and VV-C at low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.1 at each passage). We were able to propagate these viruses in HFF for at least four passages. Moreover, replication increased between 5- to 14-fold after only two passages, suggesting further adaptation occurred in HFF cells (Fig. 7B). To define mutations that may have evolved during serial passage in HFF, we performed paired-end Illumina based deep sequencing on viral DNA isolated after the fourth round of passage in HFF. Again, we did not find any mutations in rhtrs1; however, we detected an average rhtrs1 copy number of 1.7, 2.8, and 2.7 for the virus pools derived from VV-A, VV-B and VV-C, respectively, representing an average expansion of the rhtrs1 locus by approximately one additional copy relative to the PRO1190-adapted viruses. In addition, two VV gene mutations (in F7L [indel] and J6R) that arose during PRO1190 adaptation were lost after HFF adaptation, and two new mutations (in F7L [missense] and H4L) of uncertain significance appeared during HFF adaptation (Table S3). Taken together, our study suggests the hypothesis that gene amplification acts broadly to increase replication in a variety of hosts, and may provide a molecular foothold that allows for continued species-specific adaptation of the virus in more resistant hosts.",

Human immunodeficiency viruses, avian influenza viruses, and the recently described Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus exemplify the ongoing threat and potential of animal viruses to spread to and among humans, highlighting the urgent need to understand the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission and adaptation to new hosts. One such mechanism, genetic locus amplification in response to selective pressure, has been observed in both viruses and bacteria [16]\u2013[18], [21]. Here we demonstrate that amplification of the exogenous gene rhtrs1 is sufficient to block potent PKR-mediated inhibition and improve VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 replication in AGM-derived PRO1190 cells. This adaptation also expanded the species tropism of the virus, enabling markedly improved replication in otherwise resistant human and rhesus monkey cells. Importantly, VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 failed to replicate in HFF to a level sufficient to sustain transmission upon serial passage, demonstrating that adaptation in PRO1190 was a critical intermediate step to expand the viral species tropism. Thus, the process of adaptation in one host may increase the likelihood of virus transmission to a variety of divergent species.",

It is not clear whether the initial duplication(s) occurred during preparation of the VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 stock in BSC40 cells or during the first few passages in the PRO1190 cells. The observation of a faint PCR product from the starting virus, VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 using outward directed rhtrs1 primers in one of three experiments (Fig. S4), and the detection of an identical recombination break point in all 3 independently passaged virus pools suggest the amplification may have been present at a very low level in the starting virus. However, amplification of the locus in VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 occurred below the level of Illumina deep sequencing detection (Fig. 4), supporting the idea that if rhtrs1 duplications are present they are rare in the initial VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 stock. Additionally, we detected recombination between J2R and neoR (Fig. S4) only in the VV-A pool, suggesting that recombination events did arise during serial passage. Regardless of when they arose, amplifications of the rhtrs1 locus were substantially enriched during virus passage under selective pressure (Figs. 2 and 4). A previous study demonstrated amplification of K3L as an adaptive mechanism against human PKR with strikingly similar kinetics to the current study [17]. Together, these two studies support the hypothesis that preexisting or frequently arising de novo gene duplications enable vaccinia virus to adapt rapidly to selective conditions imposed by relatively resistant host restriction factors.",

Indeed, Elde, et al. detected such an adaptive mutation in K3L (H47R), apparently arising after amplification of the locus [17]. Therefore, we were surprised that no mutations arose in rhtrs1, although it may be that additional rounds of replication would reveal such mutations. We did, however, detect 13 mutations in endogenous vaccinia virus genes that occurred at >5% frequency (Fig. 4). While our data suggest that none of these mutations are necessary to expand the species tropism of VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 (Fig. 5), we have not ruled out the possibility that they may provide some replication benefit. The presence of mutations in A24R, A35R, and A37R are the most intriguing, as they were either present at >50% frequency in one pool (A24R and A37R) or detectable in all three pools (A35R). None of these genes has been previously implicated as a PKR antagonist. A37R is conserved across multiple poxvirus families (http://www.poxvirus.org), but its function is unknown. A24R is a subunit of RNA polymerase. If the mutation we identified acts like some other reported RNA polymerase mutations to decrease transcription elongation [25], [26], this mutation might result in less dsRNA production and therefore less PKR activation. A35R is a gene of unknown biochemical function that may be involved in evasion of the adaptive immune response [27], [28]. All three passaged virus pools contained nucleotide deletions in A35R at greater than 10% frequency. A35R orthologs are conserved across most poxviruses but, intriguingly, variola virus contains a truncation in its A35R gene, demonstrating that similar truncations have evolved in the past. Further studies are underway to evaluate the potential contributions of these mutations to viral replication.",

A substantial proportion of the block to VV-A replication in HFF is still mediated by PKR despite RhTRS1 overexpression (Fig. 5B), suggesting that further adaptation in HFF may be necessary to block the PKR pathway in HFF completely. These results indicate that RhTRS1 overexpression blocks human PKR incompletely. Nonetheless, viruses that had adapted by initial passage in PRO1190s replicated in HFF at a level sufficient to enable sustained passage in HFF (Fig.7B). Furthermore, these PRO1190-adapted viruses acquired additional changes as a result of serial passage in HFF, although the biological relevance of these changes is currently unclear. Combined with the observation that serial passage of VV\u0394E\u0394K+RhTRS1 in HFF failed to generate any adapted viruses (Fig. 7A), these data suggest that adaptation of rhtrs1 in minimally permissive PRO1190 cells was a critical intermediate step in the generation of a virus with broadened species tropism.",

            "text": "Cross-species pathogen transmission is an important source of emerging infections worldwide. Our study illustrates that gene amplification of a weak viral antagonist of PKR can broaden the host range of vaccinia virus. The presence of gene families in other large DNA viruses, e.g. the cytomegalovirus US22 family, of which rhtrs1 is a member, provides indirect evidence that episodes of locus amplification have also occurred in other viruses. Adaptation of a viral antagonist through non-synonymous mutations has the potential to confer a species-specific advantage for the virus in a specific host. In contrast, gene amplification and subsequent over-expression of the antagonist is more likely to increase protein activity through mass action effects in a variety of hosts. Thus, gene amplification may be a common evolutionary strategy employed by large DNA viruses, permitting modest replication in otherwise resistant host species and providing a molecular foothold that enables further adaptations necessary for more efficient replication and spread in the new host.",
