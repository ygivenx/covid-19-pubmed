The burden of infectious disease, from persistent infections [2] to intermittent outbreaks [3], is especially high in developing countries of the tropics [4]. The amount of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLL) due to infectious diseases has decreased globally in the last decade, however in areas of the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), infectious diseases still account for the majority of DALYs and YLL [5]. Despite this, the burden of infectious disease in SSA is likely underestimated due to misdiagnoses stemming from inadequate healthcare infrastructure with limited availability of diagnostic tests, procedures, and surveillance [6, 7]. These factors contribute to an environment conducive for EIDs to go unrecognized until they have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in a human population. This is highlighted by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa [8, 9], and demonstrates the need for an improved diagnostic and surveillance framework in SSA.",

Pathogen emergence has been described as a step-wise process consisting of three parts; pre-emergence, localized emergence, and pandemic emergence [12]. Pre-emergence describes pathogen transmission in natural reservoir populations where some disturbance results in pathogen expansion within natural populations, an increase in pathogen host range (non-human), and/or pathogen spread to a new geographical area. Localized emergence is characterized as pathogen spillover into human populations with restricted animal-human and/or human-human transmission. Finally, pandemic emergence refers to global spread of the pathogen through human-human transmission, or sustained transmission through the appropriate vector [12].",

Active sampling of wildlife and domestic animals has identified pathogens that may be capable of causing pandemics (i.e. pre-emergence) [19\u201324]. However, substantial physiological, ecological, and evolutionary barriers exist to pathogen host switching, and the majority of animal pathogens cannot become zoonotic [12, 25\u201328]. In order to recognize pathogens prior to pandemic emergence, it would be helpful to sample pathogens that are circulating in human populations at the stage of localized emergence. Active sampling of human blood and/or tissue is the ideal strategy to detect localized emergence, however, human sample acquisition can be invasive, costly, logistically challenging, and requires institutional review board (IRB) approval. Consequently, developing non-invasive and cost effective strategies to collect human samples for pathogen screening are necessary.",

Pathogens were detected by NGS in pooled xenosurveillance samples and finger-stick blood samples and then confirmed with qPCR and qRT-PCR to make prevalence estimates in the two sample types. Moreover, composition and count of NGS reads aligning the detected pathogens were compared between the two methods. Our results confirm that xenosurveillance and finger-stick methods for surveillance detect the same pathogens from a field setting in rural West Africa.",

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to assess H/M-DBS samples for the presence of pathogen-derived nucleic acid. RNA NGS was performed on H/M-DBS samples from a single household in Village A. The remaining samples from Village A were subject to DNA NGS. RNA NGS samples were separated into two pools by location and sample type. Total nucleic acid extraction on H/M-DBS was performed using the Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) and eluted into 50\u03bcL of water. Due to low RNA yield from H/M-DBS, samples were pooled by volume for both RNA and DNA NGS. The H-DBS pool was composed of 25\u03bcL of total RNA from each H-DBS, whereas the M-DBS pool was composed of 10\u03bcL of total RNA from each M-DBS. Each pool was DNAse treated using DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Pools were purified using a 2x ratio of RNA clean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) and eluted into 30\u03bcL of water. In order to increase reads of potential pathogen nucleic acid, an in-house protocol that uses gene specific primers and RNAse H to deplete pools of rRNA was employed. Following rRNA depletion, double-stranded DNA (cDNA) was created from the remaining RNA. First-strand synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System following manufactures protocol (Invitrogen, USA). 2nd strand cDNA synthesis was conducted immediately following 1st strand synthesis using a Klenow Fragment (3\u201d-5\u201dexo-) (New England Biolabs, USA).

The following criteria was used to remove spurious alignments: 1) Parasite did not produce top hit in Blastn search, 2) low complexity reads (e.g. ATAT repeats), or 3) reads aligned to conserved ribosomal RNA sequences. Following these criteria, 426 reads produced a quality alignment to multiple genes across all chromosomes of the P. falciparum genome (S2 File), and no nematode parasite reads/contigs were deemed legitimate.

Moreover, An. gambiae mosquitoes transmit comparably few pathogens, specifically Plasmodium sp., Wuchereria bancrofti, and O\u2019nyong nyong virus.

While specialized equipment is necessary (e.g. Insectazookas) and training is required for xenosurveillance, needles, sharps containers, antiseptics, and bandages are not needed, the occupants can continue with their regular activities, and residents do not need to be present when sampling occurs. The non-invasive nature of this technique also facilitates more frequent sampling, resulting in more blood samples collected, thus increasing the possibility of sampling pathogens that occur transiently in the blood. Additionally, no specific training is required to collect and process the mosquitoes and IRB approval is not required, as human blood is not being sampled directly. Furthermore, storing blood spots on FTA cards with RNA Later allows for bypassing cold chain, ensures deactivation of potential pathogens in samples [50], and results in nucleic acid that is a high enough quality to sequence.",

A large number of reads were produced in both our RNA and DNA NGS datasets, however, we observed a considerable reduction in reads following quality control and host filtering. Greater than 99% of reads were removed in all sequencing libraries. This is likely due to multiple factors. The RNA NGS pools saw a greater than 90% reduction in reads following removal of PCR duplicates. Because a very low quantity of RNA is recovered from individual DBS, a substantial amount of amplification is required to bring libraries to a usable quantity of nucleic acid. For RNA NGS, increasing the number of DBS per pool would reduce duplicate reads. For DNA NGS, less amplification was required as more DNA is eluted off of individual DBS. This indicated that DNA from mosquito blood-meals was more stable on FTA cards compared to RNA, which allowed us to pool more individual DBS per pool. Predictably, more unique reads were produced from DNA sequencing libraries than RNA sequencing libraries. Substantial losses of reads were observed following filtering of host nucleic acid, indicating most of the sequenced nucleic acid was derived from either humans or mosquitoes, as expected (Fig 2). These reads are not informative for pathogen identification, however they indicate mosquito blood meals were likely taken from humans. Although our in-house depletion strategy worked at clearing our M-DBS RNA sequencing samples of mosquito rRNA, the remainder of the samples would benefit from improved host depletion or pathogen nucleic acid enrichment strategies.",

Following further analysis, reads aligning to parasitic worms proved to be largely spurious based on additional bioinformatics scrutiny. This is likely the result of bacterial sequences from our samples aligning to misassemblies in the published genomes. The incorporation of contaminating bacterial sequences into whole genome assemblies is not uncommon [51\u201353]. As well, Liberia is endemic for lymphatic filariasis and An. gambiae is a primary vector of W. bancrofti in West Africa, therefore any reads aligning to this parasite in xenosurveillance samples must be from an infected host or and infected vector [54]. Similarly, multiple reads aligning to P. falciparum were identified in all sequencing pools, which is expected, however we cannot say with confidence from xenosurveillance samples whether the reads are host or vector derived. Reads aligning to P. falciparum do highlight the fact that while xenosurveillance is intended to identify any human pathogens present in peripheral blood, not just those transmitted by mosquitoes, these samples can also contribute to routine vector surveillance efforts (e.g. identifying the malaria parasite in local Anopheles mosquitoes). While we did not quantify the prevalence of P. falciparum from individual DBS in this study, the sample collection and storage method would allow for such testing. Furthermore, xenosurveillance can be conducted using other hematophagous arthropods, although a clear understanding of the natural history of the chosen organism and their ability to vector pathogens is crucial when conducting downstream analysis.",

Interestingly, although GBV-C, an RNA virus closely related to hepatitis C virus, is not known to be pathogenic, infection with this virus is associated with an increased rate of survival in patients co-infected with either HIV or Ebola virus [41, 55]. As this virus infects and replicates in CD4-positive T cells, we would expect to be able to detect GBV-C RNA in blood [56]. GBV-C has an estimated prevalence between 10\u201328% in West African countries, which is similar to our findings, albeit derived from a small sample size (Table 3) [41]. Both H and M-DBS, collected from the same household, produced a similar number of reads that aligned with high confidence to GBV-C (Fig 3A) from pooled samples. HBV reads were identified in DNA NGS pools [57]. Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is responsible for up for up to 30% of liver cirrhosis cases globally [58, 59]. Prevalence is highly variable across Africa, but is estimated to be between 4\u20138% in Liberia as determined by HBV surface antigen, which is congruent with our data (Table 3) [60]. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates both viruses are of human origin and from West Africa (Figs 4 and 5). Fewer reads from H and M-DBS aligned to HBV compared to GBV, however substantially more DBS made up the sequencing pool (Fig 3B). As well, the DNA NGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq, producing substantially fewer overall reads than RNA NGS pools sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq (S2 Table). Nevertheless, these results indicate that NGS can be a sensitive enough technique to detect a pathogen \u201csignal\u201d through host \u201cnoise\u201d in complex pooled samples of blood collected by either method. GBV-C and HBV nucleic acid was amplified using qRT-PCR and qPCR, respectively, from individual DBS, showing alternative methods can be used to detect the presence of pathogens in lieu of NGS. Due to similarity in read quality and composition collected from by each method, our data suggest xenosurveillance is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance.",

            "text": "Xenosurveillance can be a useful strategy to supplement existing public health efforts in developing regions of the world. As mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, the availability of samples is enormous. Xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. Sample storage is simple and cost effective. As well, sample quality does not appear to suffer from being collected by a mosquito, as there are no substantial differences between samples collected via xenosurveillance or finger-stick. However it remains to be determined if samples collected by xenosurveillance are useful for other means of disease surveillance (e.g. serology). Xenosurveillance is capable of detecting a wide array of pathogens [30], although this study did not reliably detect parasites and bacteria infecting humans. However, zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria [14]. Recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus support this notion [61\u201363]. In theory, routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. As well, xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring [64]. Species specific PCR can be used to identify known or suspected pathogens from xenosurveillance samples, although the use of NGS provides an unbiased detection approach. As the cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease, large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal [65]. Furthermore, as field applicable sequencing tools are being further developed and optimized, the use of real-time NGS for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens is being realized [66\u201369]. The combination of xenosurveillance and novel sequencing strategies has the potential to bring active, real-time, disease surveillance to resource-poor areas of the world.",
