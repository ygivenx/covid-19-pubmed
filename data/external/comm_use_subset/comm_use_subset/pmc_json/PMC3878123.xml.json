Search engine query data from other search engines, namely Yahoo and Baidu, also correlated well with influenza surveillance data in the US and China, respectively [6,7]. Online news data from HealthMap [8] were used to track the 2010 Haitian cholera outbreak, along with social media data (Twitter) [9].",

The project\u2019s primary aim is to develop a data collection and visualization system for better understanding of Weibo in China. Details of the methodology have been reported elsewhere [16]. In summary, the project generated a list of about 350,000 indexed microbloggers by searching the Sina Weibo user database systematically using the Application Programming Interface (API) functions provided by Sina Weibo. The inclusion criterion was those users who have at least 1,000 followers. We used high-follower-count samples for two reasons: first, in social media, high-follower-count users are relatively more influential and can often draw disproportionally larger public attention [23]. Second, this sampling strategy can minimize the influence of spam accounts, which were found widespread in China\u2019s social media [24]. Because of the heightened restriction on Sina Weibo API access, the microbloggers included in the data acquisition since January 2013 were restricted to a selective group of around 50,000 \u201copinion leaders\u201d with at least 10,000 followers. This group of microbloggers was selected for analysis in the current study in order to have fair comparison between the keyword frequencies in 2012 and 2013.",

Likewise, part of the 2012 data, prior to September 23, 2012, was used to establish the baseline for the keywords that were related to MERS-CoV. We chose 2012 as the baseline year, assuming that the underlying Weibo conversations about health-related information were not significantly different between 2012 and 2013.

After the peak, there was a quick decline in Weibo discussion on this topic. The number of Weibo posts that contain \"H7N9\" and/or \"\u79bd\u6d41\u611f\" (avian flu) declined to 7,469 per million on April 12 (a decline of 3,638.7 posts per day from April 5 to 12, assuming a linear trend, R2 = 0.9433). On April 13, the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that there was a H7N9-positive case in Beijing. The H7N9 avian flu-related posts doubled (15,864 per million, t = \u22129,741; p < 0.001). After this second peak, the attention waned and the number of posts on H7N9 avian flu declined at a rate of 1,873.6 per million per day to 1,883 per million on April 20, 2013 (Figure 2). If only the keyword \"H7N9\" was used, the signal was even more sensitive. Given its very low baseline in 2012 (mean, 0.027 per million posts, s.d. 0.265), its peak of 8,803 per million posts (t = \u2212632,933; p < 0.001) was 33,220 s.d. away from the baseline mean.",

The Chinese online community complained about the Beijing municipal government's disaster management.

Given China\u2019s SARS experience in 2003, the Chinese online community\u2019s reaction is not surprising. Our observations show that the Chinese online community discussed SARS in the first week after the first report of the H7N9 outbreak with an order of magnitude higher frequency than that in the first week after the first report of the MERS-CoV outbreak. These results again confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in China than one outside China.",

            "text": "Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31], public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32]. The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for \u201ceffective media communication\u201d, through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33]. Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be \u201cdeficient\u201d in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are \u201csufficient\u201d [34]. But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media \u201cchallenged conventional public health communication\u201d [35]. In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36]. Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34]. Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37]. Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11].",

First, we can study how information about a given disease spread across the social network as represented by Weibo. Kwak et al. [40] identified a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter and low reciprocity in Twitter follower-following topology, which was different from most human social networks. Over 85% of the top trending topics on Twitter are headline news or persistent news. Once retweeted, a tweet would reach an average of 1,000 users regardless of original tweet\u2019s number of followers [40]. However, a previous study has found that Chinese Weibo exhibits a distinct pattern of information dissemination [41]. For example, the network connections between Chinese microbloggers are markedly hierarchical than those between Twitter users, i.e. Chinese users tend to follow those at a higher or similar social level [42]; majority of Weibo posts are indeed re-posts that are originated from a small percentage of original messages [24]. It will be very interesting if further research can shed light upon how information sharing over Weibo can affect human response to the diseases off-line.",

Despite the fact that these microbloggers are more likely to be authentic users rather than spam accounts, the samples constitute less than 0.1% of the overall microblogger population [23]. However, a random sampling study finds that Weibo content contribution is unevenly distributed among users [23]. Over half of Sina Weibo subscribers have never posted, whereas about 5% of Weibo users contributed more than 80% of the original posts [23]. Hence, the sampled microbloggers in our study were the most influential microbloggers who contributed a majority of Weibo posts and drew the most attention in terms of the number of reposts and comments [23]. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, this group of high-follower-count microbloggers should be deemed fairly representative of the public attention towards the MERS-CoV and H7N9 outbreaks. But the reader should note that the findings of our study might not be generalizable to the samples collected by other sampling strategies. The operational parameters of sampling were not determined to optimize collection of data specific to a given disease. Future research is warranted to reconfirm the research findings by using a research design that is customized for specific epidemiologic research purposes.",
