H7-specific antibody responses were assessed at week 18 (2 weeks following the 16 week H7N9 MIV boost). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc t-test indicated statistically significant differences in HAI titer across the three groups at week 18 (p = 0.03 for the Anhui antigen and p = 0.02 for the Shanghui antigen). The magnitude and frequency of HAI responses was greater in group 1 (DNA prime-MIV boost) and group 2 (DNA/MIV prime-MIV boost) than in group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), indicating H7 DNA primed for a better HAI response than H7N9 MIV (Fig. 2, Table 1). Two weeks following the boost, peak GMT were higher in those receiving H7 DNA prime (groups 1 and 2) rather than H7N9 MIV prime alone (group 3), and this difference reached significance between groups 1 and 3 (33.8 vs. 8.3, p = 0.02) for the Anhui antigen and between groups 1 and 3 (24.6 vs. 5.8, p = .01) and groups 2 and 3 (14.7 vs. 5.8, p = 0.03) for the Shanghai antigen (Fig. 2). While higher titers were observed in group 1 compared to group 2, this difference was not significant for either antigen. Five of 10 individuals in group 1 achieved a positive response titer of \u22651:40 to either the Anhui or Shanghai antigen at 2 weeks post-boost while 3 of 9 individuals in group 2 and 1 of 9 individuals in group 3 achieved a positive HAI response \u22651:40 (Table 1). In all groups, peak HAI GMT was detected 2 weeks post-boost (Fig. 2, Table 1). In group 3 (MIV prime-MIV boost), peak HAI GMT was maintained until 12 weeks post-boost, although the titer was lower than both groups 1 and 2 (Fig. S1).\n\n",

In this phase 1 clinical trial, a novel H7 DNA vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and provided robust immunogenicity as a priming vaccine when boosted with H7N9 MIV. Given the absence of baseline immunity to H7 in the human population and the weak immunogenicity of H7, it is anticipated that H7N9 vaccine regimens will require more than one injection.14, 26, 27 Our results are consistent with this assertion. The DNA vaccine may provide an option for priming the immune system to improve the overall response to a heterologous booster vaccination, providing greater magnitude of antibody responses than with either vaccine alone.27\u201330 This may occur because DNA vaccines prime different populations of T cells than a protein-based vaccine, and may express a trimeric HA antigen in the membrane of the transduced cell that may have a more native structure than the HA in MIV. The duration and location of antigen presentation may also differ from MIV. These features may lead to a B-cell repertoire with different specificities and a broader expansion of antigen-specific B cells that could produce higher magnitude responses with higher avidity.23 In this trial, compared to subjects who received only H7N9 MIV twice, subjects receiving H7 DNA as a priming vaccine developed higher HAI and neutralizing antibody titers 2 weeks following the H7N9 MIV boost. While this trial contained a limited number of subjects, these results are consistent with prior studies evaluating a similar regimen for H5N1, which showed that H5 DNA priming for an H5N1 MIV vaccine improved the antibody response when the boost interval was greater than 12 weeks.22, 24\n",

Serologic evaluation of laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 in China suggest that robust antibody responses are associated with increased survival. In one cohort of 45 patients infected with H7N9, 64.9% of survivors had H7N9 HAI titers \u226580 while among fatal cases, only 28.6% had HAI titers \u226580 (ref. 31). In contrast, an additional serological evaluation of 18 patients with confirmed H7N9 infection revealed that early and rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies, rather than HAI, correlated with improved clinical outcome.32 In our study, 50% of those receiving the heterologous vaccine regimen of H7 DNA prime-H7N9 MIV boost achieved HAI titers \u22651:40 following the boost compared with only 1 of 9 receiving H7N9 MIV prime alone and boost. The HAI titers of the subjects were compared against both the Anhui and Shanghai strains. In subjects that received the H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV prime concurrently, there was a significant increase compared to the H7N9 MIV prime alone group for the Shanghui strain (14.7 vs. 5.8, p = 0.03) and marginal significance for the Anhui strain (21.6 vs. 8.3, p = 0.063). Nevertheless, the trends are very similar over the two strains. This difference in significance may have occurred due to the small number of subjects involved in the study.",

Subjects that received H7 DNA as a priming vaccine developed higher HAI and neutralizing antibody titers 2 weeks following the H7N9 MIV boost. While the small trial size is a limitation to this study, the results do agree with previous studies involving DNA priming vaccines.22, 24 Although demonstrated in multiple clinical trials, the mechanisms underlying this DNA priming effect remain poorly understood and continue to warrant evaluation. Since the population is generally naive to H7, this provided the unique opportunity to evaluate immune responses to novel influenza vaccine platforms in the absence of baseline immunity. Further evaluation of the DNA prime-inactivated protein boost regimen on the diversity of the B cell repertoire, and the ability to elicit stem-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing heterologous influenza virus strains will provide additional insight into the complex immunological response to influenza vaccination.",

The study was designed to assess the recombinant H7 DNA plasmid vaccine, VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP, administered alone or with the monovalent influenza subunit virion H7N9 Vaccine (MIV) as prime with H7N9 MIV boost compared to H7N9 MIV prime with H7N9 MIV boost. VRC 315 was designed to examine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccination regimens against H7N9 influenza, in healthy adults aged 18\u201360 years with no previous H7 avian influenza investigational vaccine administration. Subject inclusion criteria also included a body-mass index lower than 40, normal baseline blood counts, and normal liver and renal function laboratory measurements. The study was reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. Individuals provided written informed consent and completed a study specific assessment of understanding before enrollment. Human subjects protection guidelines for conducting clinical research from the US Department of Health and Human Services were followed. The primary end points evaluated the safety and tolerability of the three prime-boost regimens. The primary immunogenicity time point was 2 weeks after the H7N9 MIV boost. Sample size was determined to ensure good precision in estimating severe adverse event rate. Secondary and exploratory end points evaluated H7-specific antibody responses assessed by HAI assay and pseudovirus neutralization assays.",
