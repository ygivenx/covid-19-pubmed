            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae in the genus Vesiculovirus. VSV is an enveloped, bullet-shaped virus with a negative, single-stranded, 11,161-bp RNA genome encoding 5 proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [1,2]. Infectious VSV can be efficiently recovered by a reverse genetics approach that utilizes multiple plasmids expressing VSV genes [3,4]. Since the development of the VSV infectious clone, VSV has been considered a vaccine vector candidate due to its inability to undergo genetic recombination and genetic reassortment, and the absence of transforming properties. Furthermore, recombinant VSV can accommodate large or multiple foreign gene inserts in its genome, and has been used to express a variety of viral antigens [5\u201310]. These recombinants elicit strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses upon use as vaccines and also mediate protection against their own virus challenge in mice and non-human primates. Along with the ability to generate robust immune responses, VSV naturally infects at mucosal surfaces, enabling the use of intranasal immunization to induce both mucosal and systemic immunity [11].",

There has also been a report of a laboratory worker infected after direct exposure to VSV [15]. Although human infection is typically subclinical or only results in mild flu-like symptoms [14,16], a single case of encephalitis in a Panamanian boy associated with VSV Indiana infection has been documented [17].

            "text": "Based on the neurological effects, research objectives have shifted towards developing VSV with decreased virulence for use as a human vaccine vector [7,8,21\u201324]. These attenuated VSV can undergo a single or multiple rounds of infection and viral transcription, however, possibly inducing neurotoxicity. We have therefore developed a novel strategy to eliminate viral transcription and strongly reduce the risk of VSV neurotoxicity by deleting the P gene in the VSV genome (VSV-\u0394P). This P gene is known to encode an essential cofactor responsible for an active polymerase complex. Deletion of the P gene should completely abrogate transcription of VSV in infected normal cells while allowing for host immune response activation, leading to a safer yet equally effective vaccine compared to wild-type VSV. We have been able to show that VSV-\u0394P replicated strictly in supporting cells and caused no neurovirulence in mice. More importantly, we demonstrate that VSV-\u0394P expressing hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or hemagglutinin (HA) from a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9 were able to incorporate HN or HA on their surface. Moreover, mice immunized with these recombinant viruses generated robust immune responses similar to their replication-competent counterparts.",

To investigate the effect of P gene deletion on viral replication, VSV-\u0394P and VSV were used to infect BHK-P cells at an MOI of 0.01 and supernatants were harvested at various time points. In contrast to VSV, VSV-\u0394P was first observed 12 h post-infection, and remained at least 2 logs lower than VSV at all time points (Fig 2B). Consistent with viral replication, VSV-\u0394P produced smaller plaques than VSV (Fig 2C), and the plaques were detected 48 h post-infection compared to 24 h post-infection for VSV.

To further examine whether insertion of a foreign gene interfered with virus replication, virus growth of VSV-HA1 and VSV-\u0394P-HA1 was measured over time. All VSVs could be detected at 6 h except VSV-\u0394P (Fig 4F), similar to Fig 2B. Replication of VSV-\u0394P and VSV-\u0394P-HA1 was 2\u20134 logs lower than the P-containing VSVs, with the difference becoming noticeable after 12 h. Taken together, incorporation of foreign glycoproteins did not disrupt viral replication compared to the respective parental strain, and these viruses expressed foreign glycoproteins on the viral surface, which is relevant for eliciting immune responses against surface antigens.",
