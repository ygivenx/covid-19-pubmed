Currently, both inorganic and organic materials have been used for metabolic analysis by selected spectroscopy methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, biochemical analyzers, and mass spectrometry (MS) et al.1\u20135. In contrast with other methods, MS enjoys unique advantages of high accuracy, sensitivity, resolution, and throughput. However, the efficacy of MS and other spectroscopy methods is determined by rigorous sample pre-treatment procedures for enrichment or purification2, 6\u20139, due to the high sample complexity and low molecular abundance in biological samples. To date, MS-based analysis of metabolites in bio-fluids is still unsatisfactory in terms of selectivity, speed, costs, and reproducibility for clinical use. Therefore, to address the challenges in the sample pre-treatment, a designer material platform is in urgent demand for advanced in-vitro metabolic diagnosis.",

Inorganic particles (e.g., silicon10, 11, carbon12, 13, metal14\u201316, and metal oxide17, 18) have been preferred matrices in LDI MS for small metabolites as reported by research groups globally including ours. These particles can control the analytical variations and background signals in the mass region below m/z of 500, achieving the qualitative analysis of small metabolites, such as carbohydrates and amino acids6, 7, 19. Further coupling LDI MS with isotopic quantification, designed particles enabled metabolic analysis of rare cells, e.g., circulating tumor cells17. Notably, the LDI performance of particles is far from ideal for selective detection of small metabolites, dealing with complex bio-fluids in real case. As a result, the application of particle-assisted LDI MS for clinical diagnostics is very challenging and needs rational design of materials for use.",

Plasmonic Au nanoshells with nanoscaled surface roughness and higher hot carriers production over solid Au particles16, 22 have been demonstrated to be better candidates for LDI MS detection of small metabolites, whereas their application is very limited in complex bio-fluids for diagnostic purpose23. Notably, the analytical performance of plasmonic nanoshells depends on the selection of noble metals to adsorb ultraviolet (UV) laser and optimized shell structure for LDI MS detection.

Furthermore, coupling with isotopic quantification of selected metabolites, we demonstrated the use of these silver nanoshells for disease detection and therapeutic evaluation in clinics. For disease detection, we identified patients with postoperative brain infection through glucose quantitation and daily monitoring by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. For therapeutic evaluation, we investigated drug distribution in blood and CSF systems and validated the function and permeability of blood\u2013brain/CSF-barriers, during therapeutic treatment of patients with cerebral edema for pharmacokinetics study. Our work sheds light on the design of materials for high-performance metabolic analysis and precision diagnostics in real cases.",

            "text": "We synthesized silver nanoshells (also denoted SiO2@Ag) through a hard templating method (Fig. 1a), and the shell structures can be controlled using multi-cycled silver mirror reactions for LDI MS (Fig. 1b). The reaction temperature and time were critical and optimized in the synthesis process (Supplementary Fig. 1, see also \u201cMethods\u201d for details). We prepared mono-dispersed silica particles by the St\u00f6ber method with an average size of 181.8 \u00b1 12.53 nm and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.203 \u00b1 0.112 as the core materials (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 2). After the first cycle of silver mirror reaction, we anchored the silver nanoparticles with a size of ~2\u20134 nm onto the surface of silica particles (SiO2@Ag-1, Fig. 1c) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) demonstrated the typical inter planar spacing of 2.04 \u00c5 for silver composites along [2, 0, 0] direction (inset of Fig. 1c)24, 25. After multiple cycles (two cycles for SiO2@Ag-2, three cycles for SiO2@Ag-3, and four cycles for SiO2@Ag-4) of silver mirror reactions, we observed the gradual increase of shell thickness and silver nanoparticle size for SiO2@Ag-2 (Fig. 1d), SiO2@Ag-3 (Fig. 1e), and SiO2@Ag-4 (Fig. 1f), due to the seed-mediated growth process26, 27. We characterized the morphologies of SiO2@Ag, showing controlled nanoscaled surface roughness and nano-crevices under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by the multi-cycled silver mirror reactions (Fig. 1c\u2013f). As the electricity/heat insulating materials, the silica cores of SiO2@Ag contributed to produce more hot carriers20\u201322, 28 and retained the heat during LDI process, whereas the silver shell can be excited under 355 nm of laser22, 23, 28. Moreover, as shown in the elemental mapping analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3)29, 30, the distribution of carbon (from the small metabolites), silver (from the shell, affording similar silver nanoparticles densities on surface to Fig. 1e with silver loading ratio of 22.80% by weight), and silicon (from the core) in the nanoshells\u2013metabolites hybrids demonstrated the small molecules were trapped by nano-crevices on the surface of silver nanoshells, which would be crucial for efficient LDI of small metabolites.\n",

We obtained similar results for three batches of materials in parallel and demonstrated the reproducibility of the synthetic method with no significant difference (p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 4a).

We calculated surface area of SiO2@Ag based on the multipoint Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) model31, 35 and SiO2@Ag enjoyed larger surface area (20.72 \u00b1 0.115\u201324.20 \u00b1 0.069 m2 g\u22121) compared with the bare SiO2 particles (18.58 \u00b1 0.095 m2 g\u22121) because of the increased surface roughness and introduction of silver (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1). The increasing average size of silver nanoshells did not correlate to a similar increase in surface area due to the change of density similar to previous reports36, 37.

After the fourth reduction cycle, the absorption peak red shifted to ~443 \u00b1 1.63 nm for SiO2@Ag-4 (p < 0.05), due to the enhanced plasmon coupling and aggregation of excess silver on the surface of silica core particles (agreed to TEM and SEM, Fig. 1f). The specific increase in the maximum absorption peak can be observed in Supplementary Fig. 4b for three batches of silver nanoshells in parallel. Notably, the absorption band of silver is close to 355 nm (the wavelength for Nd:YAG laser used for LDI MS), beneficial for matrix use compared with gold nanoparticles16, 23, 40. The light absorbance increased and the plasmon resonance peak became broader with higher loading ratio of silver, agreed to TEM, SEM, DLS, and EDX characterizations demonstrating the adjustable properties of silver nanoshells through multi-cycled silver mirror reactions.

In addition, we viewed molecular peaks with Na+ adduction as well in Supplementary Fig. 10, including m/z of 205.28 [M+Na]+ for mannitol (Supplementary Fig. 10a), m/z of 203.26 [M+Na]+ for glucose (Supplementary Fig. 10b), and m/z of 172.21 [M+Na]+ for methionine (Supplementary Fig. 10c). We summarized typical m/z values of identified molecular peaks in Supplementary Table 3. In the above selection of optimized materials, the shell structure of SiO2@Ag was the key parameter and the differences in the physical and chemical properties of various small metabolites can lead to the different ionization efficiency as observed, even using the given SiO2@Ag in LDI MS analysis. SiO2@Ag-3 with a thin packed silver layer (Fig. 1) afforded structural stability, specific nano-gaps, and surface plasmon resonance, leading to significantly higher performance over the SiO2 and SiO2@Ag-1/2/4. Overloading of silver on the silica (SiO2@Ag-4) reduced the analytical efficiency of SiO2@Ag-3, owing to the surface aggregation of excess silver on the silica core (Fig. 1f, i; Supplementary Fig. 4b), rather than clumping of SiO2@Ag particles (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 11). Insufficient loading of silver (SiO2 and SiO2@Ag-1/2) also affected the analytical efficiency of SiO2@Ag-3 (Fig. 1e), due to more surface area from silica cores exposed to metabolites and less specific silver nano-crevices. Notably, the unique silver peaks (Ag1-3\n+) can be used for mass calibration in each spectrum for accurate analytes identification.",

Thus, we coupled isotopic quantification to measure the concentration of glucose for diagnostic purpose in CSF, affording consistent calibration curves with coefficient of determination (R\n2) of 0.99 using isotopes with six 13C (Fig. 3c) and using one 13C (Supplementary Fig. 18). Figure 3d showed one typical mass spectrum of analyte from five experiments (Supplementary Fig. 19 showing the other four) and its isotope with analyte/isotope (A/I) ratio of 1/1. Notably, compared to the biochemical method based quantification, the sample volume was reduced from 200 to 0.5 \u03bcL and the experiment time was reduced from hours to several minutes by the LDI MS. The isotopic quantification afforded the average recovery of ~131% with coefficient of variation (CV) within 6% (Fig. 3c), which was comparable to the biochemical method that afforded the average recovery of ~107% with CV within 14% (Supplementary Fig. 20). We concluded that the silver nanoshells (SiO2@Ag-3)-assisted LDI MS achieved fast, sensitive, accurate, multiplex, quantitative, and reproducible detection of small metabolites in native CSF without any enrichment or purification.",

Different from blood systems, glucose level in CSF is more stable as an energy source for brain and has a vital role in neurotransmitter synthesis and synaptic neurotransmission54, 55. Postoperative brain infection causes low glucose levels in CSF due to the metabolism of operation introduced bacteria53, 56, and the threshold of glucose level is ~2.8\u20133.9 mM in continued drained CSF as demonstrated in the earlier reports56, 57. As displayed in Fig. 3e for a patient with brain infection, the glucose levels were 2.83, 2.88, 3.16, and 2.71 mM for consecutive 4 days after an operation, suggesting postoperative brain infection. For comparison, the as measured glucose levels of a patient without infection were 4.66, 6.12, 5.45, and 5.09 mM using silver nanoshells-assisted LDI MS also for consecutive 4 days (Fig. 3f). Further, we detected 17 CSF samples from infected patients and 21 CSF samples from uninfected controls by our approach (Fig. 3g), which showed consistence with the current biochemical method used in hospitals affording coefficient of determination (R\n2) of 0.92 (Supplementary Fig. 21, see also Supplementary Table 5 for details). We obtained the optimized diagnostic sensitivity of 81.6% with specificity of 88.2% based on the cut-off value of 2.85 mM according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under curve of ROC (AUC) of 0.961, Fig. 3h). Previous LDI MS approaches were mostly limited to standard analysis, spiked experiments, or imaging tests, considering the difficulties in sample pre-treatment of complex bio-fluids for enrichment and purification. In the above demonstration, we demonstrated clinical diagnosis of patients with postoperative brain infection as well as daily monitoring by advanced LDI MS analysis of CSF, using the silver nanoshells with designer structural parameters.",

It is instrumental to understand the distribution and metabolism of selected drugs for pharmacokinetic study. For instance, mannitol, a small metabolite, has been long employed for reducing intracranial pressure, and increasing cerebral perfusion and blood flow during clinical treatments58, 59. Nevertheless, monitoring concentrations of small metabolites/drugs (e.g., mannitol) in serum and CSF is difficult by traditional electrospray ionization (ESI) MS techniques due to the high samples complexity and low molecular abundance, which requires enrichment or separation (such as, chemo-selective extraction and liquid/gas chromatography) and is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and very expensive for large-scale use60\u201362. With 0.5 \u03bcL of native serum, we directly obtained the Na+-adducted mannitol at m/z of 205.28 (Fig. 4a) and Ag+-adducted mannitol at m/z of 289.23 and 291.23 (Fig. 4b), together with glucose (m/z of 203.26, 287.23, and 289.23) and other small metabolite (Supplementary Table 6), based on the optimized silver nanoshells. We compared tandem mass spectra of these signals from bio-samples and standards, in addition to the accurate mass measurement for identification (Supplementary Figs. 14\u201317). As control experiments, we observed no signals by LDI MS without any matrix due to low LDI efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 22a). We obtained overwhelming background noises with few peaks from small metabolites using organic matrix (e.g., \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, CHCA) in Supplementary Fig. 22b and can only recognize glucose signal using inorganic matrix (gold nanoparticles) in Supplementary Fig. 22c, both of which demonstrated the advantages of silver nanoshells over current matrices in bio-analysis.\n",

In CSF samples analysis of three patients based on the silver nanoshells-assisted LDI MS, mannitol concentrations showed minor increase by ~29.41\u2013128.96% before and 30 min after intravenous injection during the therapeutic treatment (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Table 7, p < 0.05).

We synthesized series of silver nanoshells with controlled structures by multi-cycled silver mirror reactions and selected the designer silver nanoshells with optimized analytical performance. We revealed the mechanism for efficient LDI process associated with structural parameters of materials, and demonstrated the application in complex bio-fluids in real cases. Furthermore, coupling with isotopic quantification of selected metabolites (e.g., glucose and mannitol), we not only identified patients with postoperative brain infection by CSF analysis, but also monitored the drug concentrations in both CSF and serum to investigate the blood\u2013brain/CSF-barriers and for pharmacokinetics study. Our work contributes to the design of materials for high-performance metabolic analysis towards precision medicine and initiates the development of diverse advanced diagnostic tools involving various metabolic biomarkers.",
