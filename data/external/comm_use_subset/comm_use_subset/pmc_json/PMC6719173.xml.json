They can increase vaccination costs and mortality, which in turn could lead to severe economic losses for the livestock industry worldwide [1]. A study by Brickell et al. [2] has reported that approximately half of all deaths among calves up to the first month after birth are due to diarrhea. Calf diarrhea has a complex and multifactorial etiology. For any infectious disease, nutritional, environmental, and herd management factors such as housing type, colostrum intake, and hygienic conditions can be associated with field outbreaks, indicating that these factors may influence the severity and outcome of the disease [3,4].",

However, when 1.0 g of a product containing Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SB; 2 \u00d7 1010 CFU/g) is incorporated into milk replacer, it does not improve DMI or growth of young calves [10]. Interestingly, less calves have diarrhea or pneumonia if they receive yeasts, regardless of dosages or strains [9,10], without noting conditions of ambient temperature and humidity. Calves experiencing HS show elevated body temperature [11,12,13] which can increase intestinal permeability of enteric pathogens. Calves exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. coli O55:B5) also show increased body temperature [14]. Meanwhile, yeast can alleviate the effects of HS on the number of undesirable enteric microbes [14] and acute inflammatory responses in swine [15]. However, few data are available on calf responses to SB coupled with HS in a controlled environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of SB supplementation in milk replacer on performance and physiological traits of dairy young calves under HS. We hypothesized that serial concentrations of SB ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 g (2 \u00d7 1010 CFU/g) could reduce responses of calves under HS, such as increasing rectal temperature, heart rate, and frequency of fecal diarrhea.",

During both experimental periods, calves were fed ad libitum, and residues of each calf starter, rice straw, and water were recorded daily. The calf starter was provided by National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Konkuk calf starter; Anyang, Korea) to meet nutrition requirements of the National Research Council (NRC) [16] for growing calves. Samples of milk replacer, calf starter, and rice straw were ground to pass a 1-mm screen (standard model 4, Arthur H.

Briefly, 100 mg of fecal sample was added to 1 ml of lysis buffer and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Lysed sample was then transferred to the well of a plastic vessel containing 50 \u00b5L of magnetic silica and subjected to automatic magnetic separation. Genomic DNA extracted was eluted with 100 \u00b5L of elution buffer. Subsequently, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify yeast, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Enterobacteriaceae, and E. coli using group-specific primer sets [21] as shown in Table S1. Extracted DNA (2 \u03bcL) was transferred into 18 \u03bcL of PCR mix consisting of SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan,), distilled water, forward and reverse primers, and ROX dye (Takara Bio Inc.,) in a 96-microwell real-time PCR plate. Samples in the plate were analyzed using an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the following reaction conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 34 s. For melting curve analysis, the temperature was decreased from 95 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s with continuous acquisition of fluorescence signal intensity. Data were analyzed using ABI 7500 v. 2.3 software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR for quantification of Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) was also performed as described above, except that a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used as described previously [22]. PCR conditions were: 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 60 s.

Although the ADG of calves supplemented with MSB showed a numerical increase compared to others during the experiment period, the increase was not statistically significant. Increased DMI found in the MSB group in the current study was consistent with results in other studies. For example, it has been reported that DMI and body weight (BW) gain in calves are improved when yeast fermentation products are included in calf starter [25]. Water consumption was greater (p < 0.05) in the LSB and MSB groups compared to that in the control group during the TN period. No significant difference in water consumption was found among treatment groups during the HS period. Despite the increases in DMI, BW and ADG barely increased in the present study, in contrast to the results of previous studies, after feeding calves with SB incorporated into milk replacer [9] or by oral infusion [10]. These results suggest that nonfermenting yeast can improve DMI without affecting BW gain or ADG in the growth stage of calves. In the current study, with increasing temperature during the HS period, water intake increased, particularly when the temperature was above 30 \u00b0C compared to the TN period. Increased water intake during the HS period is closely associated with body temperature control in ruminants [26], because ruminants can control their body temperatures by discharging sweat through skin. For this reason, when animals are exposed to high temperature and high relative humidity, physiological sweat discharge is elevated to control their body temperature. However, no alleviating effect of SB supplementation on water intake of calves during the HS period was observed in the present study. ",

However, calves in all SB groups (LSB, MSB, and HSB) showed lower (p < 0.05) fecal scores during the HS period compared to those in the control group (Table 3). Rectal temperature and heart rates of calves in SB groups were lower (p < 0.01) than those in the control group throughout the whole experimental period except for calves in the LSB group during the HS period. Consistent with previous studies [9,10], the current study also showed that milk replacer supplemented with SB could decrease the rectal temperatures and heart rates of calves, particularly during the HS period. Among hormonal parameters, cortisol concentration has been used as an indicator of stress status in animals [27]. High temperature is a factor that can increase stress of calves, resulting in higher blood cortisol concentrations. For instance, continuous exposure to high heat, or temperatures exceeding 37.7 \u00b0C, for at least six hours can cause a significant increase in cortisol levels [11]. In the current study, no significant difference in serum cortisol concentration was found among treatment groups on day zero. No increase in serum cortisol level of calves receiving MSB supplementation during the TN period was observed either, although the cortisol level of calves supplemented with MSB was lower (p < 0.05) than that in the control group during the HS period. These results suggest that SB diets can alleviate thermal stress experienced by young calves by reducing blood cortisol level.

            "text": "In the present study, fecal densities of E. coli and Enterobacteriace were partially decreased (p < 0.05) by SB diet during the TN period, but this had no affect among treatment groups during the HS period (Table 4). During the whole experimental period, S. enteritidis and C. perfringens were not detected in the faeces of calves. Feeding SB to calves increased (p < 0.05) the population of fecal yeast during TN and HS periods, suggesting that SB remaining in the digestive tract could decrease the number of undesirable bacteria through competing for sites of colonization of E. coli and Enterobacteriace during the TN period. In addition, they might provide stability for gut microbiota by decreasing the number of E. coli and Enterobacteriace during the HS period. Increasing the body temperature of calves that experience HS [11,12,13] can increase intestinal epithelial permeability responses to enteric pathogens. Additionally, previous studies [28,29] have reported that calves exposed to LPS (E. coli O55:B5) show increased rectal temperature and body temperature compared to saline-infused calves. These changes are accompanied by the presence of fever, the main indicator of acute inflammatory response. Yeasts including SB possess the ability to reduce the number of undesirable enteric microbes [14]. They can inhibit inflammation associated with immune and cortisol responses in swine [15]. The findings of the current study suggesst that the alleviating effect of SB not only reduced E. coli density in faeces and cortisol level in blood, but also elevated yeast remaining in faeces, leading to decreased rectal temperature and diarrhea frequency in calves experiencing HS.

We found some supporting data [9,10] on certain concentrations of SB incorporated into milk replacer (0.5 g or 1.0 g of SB; 2 \u00d7 1010 CFU/g). Indeed, data supporting the determination of the optimal concentration of SB in pre-ruminants, especially under HS conditions using a climatic chamber, are limited.",
