The codons encoding the same amino acid is called synonymous codon. During biosynthesis of protein, usage probability of those synonymous codons is different. Some species or some genes are usually prone to use one or several particular synonymous codons. These codons are called preferable codons, which is called as codon bias. Usage bias of codons from various species has been studied, and it is found that during protein biosynthesis synonymous codons encoding amino acid is not used randomly [1-3]. Many studies have indicated that obvious bias exists between different genes from different species or the same species [4-6]. Usage bias of codons is influenced mainly by mutation bias, translation selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobia and hydrophilia of protein, and external environment [7-13].",

            "text": "PCV belongs to genus of porcine circovirus, family of porcine circovirus. It has two genotype, PCV genotype I and PCV genotype II, and it is the smallest virus which has been discovered so far [14]. Among the different genotype, PCV genotype II infection and its related diseases have become one big problem across the globe for pig feeding, which threatens greatly to normal development of the industry of pig feeding. The PCV genome is a single-stranded negative circular DNA, and very small; full length of the PCV genotype I is only 1,759 bp, and PCV genotype II, 1,767 bp or 1,768 bp. The genome contains 11 open reading frames (ORF), among which, ORF1 encodes replication-associated proteins (Rep and Rep'); ORF2, structural proteins (viral capsid proteins, Cap); ORF3, toxicity-associated proteins, which can cause apoptosis [15,16]. By analyzing the whole sequence of PCV genome, it is found that ORF2 has smaller selective pressure than ORF1, and more mutation. Nucleotide sequences among various strains in the same genotype are very conservative, their homology is over 90%, while similarity between nucleotide sequences from various strains respectively from the two genotypes is less than 80% [17,18]. However, so far, studies have not related to usage of PCV codons. Explanation of codon usage pattern of PCV has significance on PCV evolution, gene prediction, gene classification, design of high expressed genes and viral vectors, and understanding of interaction between PCV and its host cells. Therefore, in this study, we first performed comprehensive analysis on codon usage pattern of PCV genome and the related factors affecting on codon usage. This study will play a major role in explanation of evolution process of PCV genome and further studies.",

            "text": "In order to investigate usage pattern of the PCV codons, we calculated various RSCU values of various codons from 28 different strains from different genotype. It can be seen from the three-dimension mesh plot of the analysis results of correspondence between 59 synonymous codons in the PCV genome (See Figure 1), range of Z axis (f'1) is between 15 to 2.5, which indicates that synonymous codons usage in the PCV genome is not balanced, that is to say, among all the 59 synonymous codons, a part of codon is rarely used, while others have higher usage frequency. Additionally, it can be seen from Table 1 that among 18 preferable codons, 12 ones have the end base of G or U, only 6 have the end base of A or C, and so those codons with the end base of G or U are prone to use in PCV genome. Nevertheless, compared with other vertebrate DNA viruses, PCV genome has lower GC%, from 48.35% to 49.12%, with an average content of 48.61% and SD value of 0.19 (Table 2). And hence, the phenomenon, that in PCV genome GC content is lower while the condons with the end base of G is used in a way of bias, suggests that content of G or C as the end base of codons has effect on usage pattern of synonymous codons. Apart from this, we can also see from Table 2, ENC values between PCV genomes has less fluctuation, with a range from 55.32 to 58.67, and an average value of 56.80 and SD value of 0.85, which indicates that codon bias of the PCV genome is stable.",

We can see from Figure 2, except for two strains of PCV genotype I in deviation from the cluster, other all the strains of PCV genotype II lie in the same cluster and overlap partly with each other. Obviously, PCV genotype I and PCV genotype II lay in two independent areas, which demonstrate that codon usage between the different PCV genotype is of great significance. Meanwhile, PCV genotype II-A and PCV genotype II-B almost lie in the same area, but they have tiny difference (Figure 2), which suggests that different sub-genotype from the same PCV genotype have difference in the aspect of codon usage.",

As parasitic organisms, virus's codon usage pattern would be subject to its host to some extent [6]. In this study, patterns of codon usage are compared in PCV and its natural host, and then found that there are high similarities between them. In detail, the high frequently used codons in the swine were also the non-preferred codons of PCV, such as CUG, GUG, CAG, AAU, GAC, GAA, UGU, AGA and UUU. Further more, all preferentially used codons of the genome of PCV and swine were all G-ended or U-ended codons (Table 1). These results suggest that the selection pressure from the host affects codon usage pattern of PCV. It is worthwhile to note that PCV genotype II have high similarities with swine than PCV genotype I (Figure 4). In details, the values of RSCU in PCV genotype II and swine codon such as, AGA for Arg, GUG for Val, AGC for Ser, ACC for Thr were clearly different from that of PCV genotype I. It may be important one of Molecular mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis of PCV genotype II.",

To study the possible effect of dinucleotide composition on codon usage of the PCV genome, the relative abundances of the 16 dinucleotides in genome of the 28 PCV strains were calculated (Table 5). The result show that the occurrences of dinucleotides are not randomly distributed and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies. The relative abundance of CpG showed a strong deviation from the \"normal range\" (mean \u00b1 SD = 0.622 \u00b1 0.029) and was markedly under represented. Correspondingly, the synonymous codon containing the CpG were inhibited because of CpG was present at the expected frequencies. In detail, low RSCU values were present in 7 of all 8 codon containing CpG and they are all not preferentially used codons (such as CCG, UCG, ACG, CGC, CGG, CGA, CGU) (Table 1).

A plot of the f'1 and the f'1 of each virus of Circoviridae was shown in Figure 5. We can see from the plot that there were considerable differences for codon usage patterns among PCV, DCV, GCV, CoCV, CAV and BFDV. Concretely, PCV belong to the different genotype tends to come together. Moreover, DCV, GCV, CoCV and BFDV tend to come together and CAV was alone in separate area. It's clear that although different virus tends to come together, differences of synonymous codon usage pattern still exist between each virus.

As can be seen from the plot, coordinate of virus isolates from different country is separated, and these relatively isolated spots tend to cluster into several groups according to the genotype (Figure 6). All above imply that these strains of PCV isolated from different places have different trend in codon usage variation. In addition, we performed another correlation analysis on f'1 in principal component analysis between GRAVY and the aromaticity score of each protein. From the result, we found that f'1 was high positive correlation with GRAVY (Spearman, r = 0.875, p < 0.001), and high negative correlation with aromaticity (Spearman, r = 0 905 p < 0.001).",

Precious studies reveal that different genes from different species or the same one have obvious codon usage bias [21,22]. Codon usage bias is influenced mainly by mutation bias [23,24], translation selection [25,26], secondary protein structure [20,27], replication and transcription selection [28], secondary mRNA structure [29], gene length [30], tRNA abundance [31], gene function and external environment [32]. However, most of these studies focus on some higher organism and many microorganisms with large genome and more genes, and there are few studies on virus with small genome and few genes or comparison between virus and host. Relatively, there are more reports on codon usage in genomes from viruses with great harm to mankind, such as SARS, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus A and hepatitis virus. PCV is a primary pathogen of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has threatened the development of pig feeding industry seriously because in recent year's occurrence of this disease has increased so as to bring about great economic loss in the world industry of pig feeding. Further studies on codon usage pattern in PCV have great significance on mutation pattern and molecular evolution of PCV. However, reports on codon usage pattern in PCV are rare, and this study is the first report.",

In addition to this, the results in this study also reveal that geological factor may almost have relation with codon usage in PCV. In some reports, gene length has certain correlation with codon usage [30]. Similarly, in some viruses, gene length has no effect on codon usage [22]. With correlation analysis we surveyed codon usage bias and gene length in PCV, and it is found that in these viral genes, codon usage bias has no notable correlation with gene length (Spearman, r = 0.075, p > 0.1).
