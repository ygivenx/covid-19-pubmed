The first cases were reported in Mexico and the United States in April, and by June, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a level 6 pandemic [5]. According to the WHO \u201cGlobal Alert and Response\u201d in 2010, this pandemic infected more than a million individuals and took 18,449 lives [6].

However, traditional egg-based influenza vaccines have several limitations, including vulnerability of supply chain, the necessity for selecting strains a priori, allergic reactions to egg proteins in the vaccine, and an often time-consuming production process\u2014all important issues that need to be addressed [9]. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms [10\u201314]. One such alternative approach is baculoviruses, which do not replicate or impose any apparent cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, thus minimizing possible side effects [15, 16].",

These attributes have fueled interest in exploring baculoviruses as vectors for recombinant protein expression systems and gene therapy [18\u201320]. In spite of the advantages of baculovirus, overcoming their lower efficacy relative to that of conventional vaccines remains a challenge [21]. We previously reported that a non-replicable baculovirus vector containing antigen-encoding DNA could serve as a nano-delivery system, and improve exogenous gene delivery into human cells by incorporating the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) on recombinant baculovirus [21\u201323].",

In contrast to live viruses, VLPs are non-infective and non-replicating, since they are essentially devoid of pahogenetic material [24]. Moreover, VLPs have been known to enhance immunogenicity by presenting antigenic epitopes in correct conformation, resulting in strong humoral and cellular immune responses [24, 26, 27]. Given these advantages, VLPs have been widely used for vaccine development and other biomedical applications [28].",

Also, AcHERV-VLP includes M1 protein as a VLP component and recent publication indicates that M1 protein contains highly conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing cross-reactivity [37, 40].

[38]. Th1 stimulating VLP forming DNA vaccine contains major T cell epitopes in VLP forming components. Not only HA but also influenza NA and M1 protein have conserved CD8+ T cell epitopes [46, 47]. Therefore, VLP forming AcHERV-VLP presented more T cell epitopes to cellular immune cells than HA protein targeted AcHERV-HA.",
