MERS-CoV has predominantly affected the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries with sporadic cases arising in Europe and North America as the result of travel to and from the Middle East (3). A recent outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea has raised the specter that unrecognized infections combined with potential superspreaders may pose a much greater risk of significant travel-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV than previously suspected, particularly in health care settings (4, 5). The lethality of MERS-CoV and the ease of global travel necessitate further study and understanding of the mechanisms of MERS-CoV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV, a lineage C Betacoronavirus, has a 30-kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. As with all CoVs, the first 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome consists of the replicase encoded in open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b. The remaining 3\u2032 one-third encodes the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) as well as accessory proteins (encoded in ORF3 to ORF5 and ORF8b) that are not required for genome replication but likely act as immune antagonists that may be critical for pathogenesis (6\u20138). Indeed, MERS-CoV and other CoVs induce type I interferon (IFN) only weakly and late in infection (9\u201315), suggesting that coronaviruses have evolved mechanisms of immune evasion. Furthermore, there are reports that MERS-CoV accessory protein NS4a (encoded by ORF4a), NS4b (encoded by ORF4b), and NS5 (encoded by ORF5), when overexpressed from plasmids, antagonize type I IFN induction and signaling at various points in the pathways (16\u201319). NS4a is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein (17). NS4b is detected primarily in the nucleus (16\u201319), making NS4b and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF3a-encoded proteins (20, 21) the only known coronavirus proteins thus far to be detected in the nucleus (20, 21). A MERS-CoV mutant with deletions of ORFs 3 to 5 is attenuated for replication in human airway-derived Calu-3 cells (22), and a mutant with deletions of ORFs 4a and 4b is attenuated for replication in hepatic carcinoma-derived Huh-7 cells (23).",

            "text": "The type I IFN response is an essential component of antiviral innate immunity and is initiated when host sensors initiate signaling pathways resulting in transcription of type I IFN genes (9, 10, 24). IFN activates transcription of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISG); among these and most relevant to this report are the OAS genes (25). Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), upon detection and binding of dsRNA, synthesizes 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2-5A) [px5\u2032A(2\u2032p5\u2032A)n; x = 1 to 3; n \u2265 2] from intracellular ATP that induces the homodimerization of latent RNase L, leading to its subsequent activation (24, 26, 27). Activated RNase L cleaves both viral and host ssRNA preferentially at UU and UA dinucleotide sequences, leading to translational arrest and apoptosis, and limits viral replication and spread in vitro and in vivo (24, 28, 29). In addition, RNA cleavage products can be recognized by RNA sensors, leading to further augmentation of IFN production and signaling (30).",

MERS-CoV NS4b was found to have no primary amino acid sequence homology outside of lineage C Betacoronavirus. To broaden the search for homologous proteins, we used tertiary structural prediction and homology search by Phyre2 (31) and I-TASSER (32, 33). The top scoring structure identified by both servers was the central domain of Rattus norvegicus A kinase anchoring protein 7 isoform gamma or delta (AKAP7\u03b3/\u03b4) (PDB: 2VFK), a 2H-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily member with 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity (34) (Fig. 1A). These enzymes are characterized by two H-\u03a6-[ST]-\u03a6 motifs (where \u03a6 is a hydrophobic residue) separated by an average of 80 residues (35). To generate a more accurate predicted structure, the 2H-PE domain of MERS-CoV NS4b was modeled directly on AKAP7 using one-to-one threading on Phyre2 followed by loop and side chain refinement in Modeller (Fig. 1B) (29, 31). For comparison, the recently solved structure of lineage A Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2, a 2H-PE with 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity, is also shown (Fig. 1C) (36).",

While both BtCoV homologs have the 2 [H-\u03a6-(S/T)-\u03a6] predicted catalytic motifs, SC2013 NS4b (previously referred to as NS3c [37]) had low-confidence structural homology (<45%) with AKAP7, and HKU5 NS4b had no significant structural homology with any structures in the Phyre2 database (38). However, alignment of the regions surrounding the H-\u03a6-(S/T)-\u03a6 motifs with cellular AKAP7 from rat, mouse (Mus musculus, NP_061217.3), and virus-encoded 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs illustrates the conservation of these two motifs (Fig. 2A). We have previously shown that the central domain of the M. musculus AKAP7\u03b3 and simian rotavirus A (RVA), strain SA11, VP3 protein carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) are catalytically active 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs (28, 34, 35, 39). Additionally, MERS-CoV NS4b and BtCoV homologs, like the rat and mouse AKAP7 but unlike any of the known viral PDEs, including MHV NS2 or rotavirus VP3 CTD, contain an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Fig. 2B) (16, 18, 19). In addition to a PDE domain, AKAP7\u03b3 also contains a carboxy-terminal binding domain for the regulatory subunit II (RII) of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (PKA-RII-\u03b1-BD) (39), and VP3 contains amino-terminal guanylyltransferase (Gtase) and methyltransferase (Mtase) domains (E) (28), neither of which are found adjacent to coronavirus PDE domains.",

Purified proteins were incubated with various 2-5A substrate concentrations and subsequently used to assess enzyme kinetics via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based RNase L activation assay (29). Substrate steady-state kinetic studies were performed (see Materials and Methods for details), and the quantity of cleaved 2-5A was determined as a function of time from 180-min progress curves conducted in triplicate. The best-fit parameter estimates are shown in Table 1. All three proteins were capable of cleaving 2-5A and preventing the activation of RNase L with similar kinetic parameters to MHV NS2. As expected, mutant proteins containing a His-to-Arg mutation in the second catalytic motif were incapable of cleaving 2-5A (Fig. 3A). Although the activities of all three NS4b proteins were similar to that of MHV NS2 (Fig. 3B), velocities plateaued at lower concentrations of 2-5A compared with MHV NS2, suggesting that the lineage C proteins become saturated more quickly at higher 2-5A concentrations (Fig. 3C to E).",

In addition, we constructed chimeric MHVs expressing MERS-NS4b with a deletion of the amino-terminal 52 amino acids including the NLS (MHV-MERS\u03941-52WT) as well as its catalytically inactive mutant MHV-MERS\u03941-52Mut. Thus, wild-type (WT) or mutant NS4b genes were cloned into the MHVMut genome in place of MHV ORFs 4a and 4b which encode protein(s) with no known function in MHV replication or pathogenesis (40) (Fig. 4). To assess expression of NS4b proteins from chimeric viruses, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) derived from mice genetically deficient in RNase L (RNase L\u2212/\u2212) were infected with each of the chimeric viruses in addition to WT MHV and MHVMut expressing catalytically inactive mutant NS2. (RNase L\u2212/\u2212 BMM were used rather than B6 BMM because an active PDE is required for robust replication in the latter [29].) BMM were lysed at 12 h postinfection, and protein lysates were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Flag to detect NS4b proteins, antibodies against viral nucleocapsid to assess viral replication, and antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a loading and transfer control. All NS4b proteins were expressed in RNase L\u2212/\u2212 BMM but to different extents, and mutant NS4b proteins were expressed at lower levels than WT NS4b proteins were, possibly reflecting reduced protein stability as a result of the mutations (Fig. 5A). Similar findings were obtained with chimeric virus infection of 17Cl-1 cells (data not shown).",

Previously, we found that murine AKAP7 was exclusively nuclear and that it could not act as a PDE to rescue replication of chimeric mutant MHV unless the NLS was removed and cytoplasmic expression was achieved (34), so it was important to determine the subcellular localization of NS4b protein during chimeric virus infection. Thus, immunofluorescence staining was carried out to assess expression and subcellular localization of expression of each NS4b protein. Murine L2 cells were infected with chimeric viruses expressing both MERS-CoV NS4b and corresponding CoV homologs, fixed at 8 h postinfection, and stained with anti-Flag antibodies (NS4b) and antibodies against the MHV nucleocapsid protein, which is expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, MERS-CoV and BtCoV-SC2013 NS4b proteins localized to the nucleus with expression in the cytoplasm as well, while the BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b homolog was almost completely nuclear, similar to reports of overexpressed NS4b in the literature (16\u201318). As expected, MHV-MERS\u03941-52WT expressing an NS4b with deletion of the NLS was localized to the cytoplasm.",

All three WT NS4b proteins, but not mutant NS4b proteins, were able to rescue MHVMut replication in WT BMM (Fig. 6A to D). Similar results were obtained for the pair of viruses expressing BtCoV HKU5 NS4b proteins (data not shown). MHV expressing MERS-CoV WT NS4b (MHV-MERSWT) replicated to a titer equivalent to that of WT MHV. Viruses expressing the BtCoV homologs replicated well in B6 BMM but not quite to the same extent as WT MHV or MHV-MERSWT, similar to findings with the chimeric viruses expressing PDE of RVA VP3 CTD and cellular AKAP7 protein (28, 34) (Fig. 6D and data not shown). As expected, viruses expressing mutant as well as WT NS4b proteins replicated to high titer in RNase L\u2212/\u2212 BMM.

Similarly, MHV-MERSWT, both full-length and MHV-MERS\u03941-52WT mutant and MHV-SC2013WT clearly prevented RNase L-mediated RNA degradation, while viruses expressing the inactive mutant proteins activated the OAS-RNase L pathway.

In fact, NS4a is a dsRNA binding protein that may help sequester viral dsRNA and prevent stimulation of OAS and subsequent activation of RNase L (17, 18). In addition, since NS4a and NS4b are expressed from the same mRNA by an unknown mechanism of initiation of translation, it is possible that deletion of ORF4b could result in increased expression of the upstream ORF encoding NS4a and increased dsRNA binding and inhibition of RNase L, negating the need for a PDE to antagonize RNase L. Thus, we constructed MERS-NS4bH182R, expressing NS4b with an inactive PDE, and assessed its replication and ability to active RNase L in Calu-3 cells. While MERS-NS4bH182R replicated similarly to WT MERS (data not shown), it did promote RNase L degradation and like the deletion mutants only at late times postinfection (Fig. 8D).",

The type I IFN response is an essential component of the antiviral innate immune response and is activated when host sensors detect viral dsRNA, leading to production of type I IFN (9, 10, 24). IFN activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), leading to the development of an antiviral state in the infected cells and in neighboring cells, thereby restricting viral spread. Based on overexpression experiments, it was previously reported that MERS-CoV NS4b and HKU5 NS4b proteins antagonize type I IFN signaling by several different methods, including interaction with Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), leading to inhibition of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and subsequent beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) transcription (16, 18, 19). It was recently shown by overexpression of NS4b and an IFN-\u03b2 promoter reporter plasmid that MERS-CoV NS4b interacts with as yet unknown nuclear targets inhibiting IRF3- and IRF7-induced IFN-\u03b2 transcription (19). It is important to note that there is little if any information on IFN antagonism during MERS-CoV infection, and none of these reports recognized the enzymatic activity of NS4b proteins. Nevertheless, the previous publications in combination with our current study of the enzymatic activity of NS4b proteins suggest that NS4b proteins are multifunctional with activities in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, consistent with its localization in both cellular compartments.",

However, NS4b was predicted by tertiary structural modeling to be a 2H-PE and the fact that it is conserved in all sequenced lineage C Betacoronavirus genomes suggested that NS4b is an enzymatically active 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE (29), as confirmed in this study. Furthermore, NS4b protein antagonizes the OAS-RNase L pathway by cleaving 2-5A and blocking the subsequent activation of RNase L (7, 29). Additionally, closely related lineage C Betacoronavirus BtCoV-SC2013 and BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b proteins are enzymatically active PDEs with similar activity to MERS-CoV NS4b. We have demonstrated that these lineage C proteins can cleave 2-5A in vitro and that their kinetic parameters are similar to those of NS2.",

            "text": "Limitation of RNase L activation can have a profound effect on enhancing virus replication and spread as well as leading to decreased IFN production in myeloid cells (7, 29, 42). Indeed, we previously found that the 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE of MHV NS2 is a determinant of myeloid cell tropism and a critical liver virulence factor in mice (29). Thus, to initially assess the effectiveness of NS4b proteins, we utilized the chimeric MHV NS2 mutant virus system that was previously used to demonstrate activity for RVA and AKAP PDEs (28, 34). Lineage C PDEs were expressed from chimeric MHV with an NS2Mut background, encoding an inactive PDE. MERS-CoV NS4b and BtCoV homologs were detected by immunoblotting to different extents, as normalized to the amount of MHV nucleocapsid protein detected, with the mutant proteins less well expressed compared to WT proteins. The different levels of expression of WT proteins and the more efficient expression of the WT PDEs compared to the corresponding mutant proteins was observed in both BMM and murine 17Cl-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 5 and data not shown), suggesting that there may be differences in stability in the WT proteins and that the mutant proteins may be less stable. Nevertheless, we were able to rescue replication in murine BMM with wild-type MHV-MERS, wild-type BtCoV-2013 (Fig. 6), and wild-type BtCoV-HKU5 (data not shown) but not with viruses expressing corresponding mutant PDEs and in the case of MHV-MERSWT, but not MHV-MERSMut, in vivo in the mouse liver as well. Since the NS4b catalytic mutants used here are poorly expressed, they do not provide the ideal control and we cannot rule out the possibility that either one or more would rescue at a higher expression level or that factors other than the PDE activity contribute to rescue. This, however, is highly unlikely, as we know from several previous studies (28, 29, 34) that efficient expression of catalytic mutant PDE does not rescue replication of MHV NS2 mutant virus, while supplying with heterologous PDE does (28, 29, 34).",

Murine AKAP7, which contains an NLS, can rescue only chimeric PDE-deficient MHV in the absence of the NLS (34). Interestingly, it is unnecessary to remove the NLS from the MERS and SC2013 NS4b proteins to achieve rescue of chimeric MHV, and in fact, removal of the N-terminal 52 amino acids, including the NLS, of MERS-CoV NS4b confers no replication enhancement (Fig. 6), suggesting that the NLS neither hinders nor improves OAS-RNase L antagonism. Recombinant HKU5 NS4b clearly has 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity (Fig. 3), and MHV-HKU5WT (but not MHV-HKU5Mut) clearly replicates efficiently in B6 BMM (data not shown), demonstrating that HKU5 NS4b can replace the function of NS2 in the MHV chimeric background. However, there was still detectable RNA cleavage in BMM infected with both MHV-HKU5WT and MHV-HKU5Mut (data not shown). The most likely explanation is that BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b does not antagonize RNase L activation as well as MERS-CoV or BtCoV SC2013 NS4b does, because it is more localized to the nucleus, consistent with our findings with the PDE of AKAP7 (34). It is also possible the rRNA is more susceptible to cleavage than viral RNA; therefore, the less effective BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b cannot antagonize RNase L effectively enough to spare rRNA while still protecting viral and/or cellular mRNA.",

Although all mutants induced rRNA degradation, only MERS-\u0394NS3-5 had a reduction in viral titer by 24 h postinfection. Thus, the lack of effect on replication of MERS-\u0394NS4 or MERS-NS4bH182R correlates with the weak rRNA degradation observed and indicates a lack of biological effect in this cell type of deleting or inactivating the NS4b PDE. This may be due in part to the very late times postinfection (24 to 48 h) that we observe rRNA degradation; virus replication is already quite robust by that time, and it may be too late for restriction of replication to occur.",

Indeed, RNase L is not readily activated in Calu-3 cells compared to other cell types; the amount of rRNA degradation observed in Sindbis virus-infected A549 cells is clearly more than in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 8A), and we did not observe robust activation of RNase L Calu-3 cells even when transfected with the dsRNA surrogate poly(I \u22c5 C) (data not shown).

To delete NS4b, sequence was synthesized (Bio Basic) in which mutations were made in the overlap region between NS4a and NS4b to abrogate putative start codons (T2C and T17C; all positions relative to the NS4b start) and to insert premature stop codons (A91T, C97A, and C102G). Additionally, residues 106 to 669 were deleted to remove the majority of NS4b but leave in place transcriptional regulatory sequence 5. The truncated NS4b cassette and MERS-CoV infectious clone F plasmid were digested with PacI and SanDI, and truncated NS4b was ligated into the MERS-CoV F plasmid. To construct the MERS-NS4bH182R mutant, two PCRs were performed using the F plasmid as the template to synthesize overlapping DNA fragments and introducing an H182R substitution. These two templates were then joined in an overlapping extension PCR. The resultant product was digested with PacI and SanDI and cloned into the MERS F plasmid. Assembly of the infectious clone and recovery of infectious virus were performed as described previously (22). The potential gain-of-function (GOF) concerns of MERS-\u0394NS4b and MERS-NS4bH182R were evaluated and reviewed by NIH under grant U19AI107810 and approved for continued study.
