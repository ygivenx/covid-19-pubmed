            "text": "It has been reported by numerous investigators that CD4+ T cells are essential for the maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells [1]\u2013[5]. However, in the induction and maintenance of CD8+ memory T cells, different roles of CD4+ T cells have been described [6]\u2013[9]. In the so-called \u201cclassical model\u201d, CD4+ T cells contribute to memory CD8+ T-cell generation indirectly via APCs [6]. Through the CD40-CD40L interaction between CD40L on CD4+ T cells and CD40 on APCs, CD4+ T cells \u201clicense\u201d APCs for the induction of memory CD8+ T cells. As an alternative to this APC licensing model, Bourgeois et al. [7] provided evidence demonstrating that CD4+ T cells contribute directly to CD8+ T cells through CD40 on CD8+ T cells, rather than indirectly via APCs. However, these findings were countered by studies in which long-lived CD8+ memory T cells were generated in the absence of CD40 expression on CD8+ T cells [8], [9]. In addition, as for the role of CD40-CD40L interaction in the induction of memory CD8+ T cells, Hernandez et al. [10] reported that CD8+ T cells themselves provided CD40L in order to license APCs for the induction of memory CD8+ T cells. In their scenario, although the CD40-CD40L interaction between T cells and DCs is indispensable for the induction of memory CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells are not necessarily involved. Thus, the research so far has not resolved the role of CD4+ T cells in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells, although resolving this issue is a critical step in designing better vaccination and immunotherapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Upon natural infection, the host responds by inducing humoral and cellular immunity against the pathogen. Humoral immune responses are represented by the production of antibodies that bind to the surfaces of bacteria and viruses, whereas cellular immune responses mediate immunity to intracellular pathogens. In general, extracellular antigens are presented via MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells, whereas intracellular antigens are presented via MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells. To induce antigen-specific CTL, antigens must be loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway in APCs via cross-presentation [11]. In the cross-presentation, exogenous proteins cross over to the endogenous pathway to gain access to MHC class I molecules. Using this phenomenon, a generation of antigen-specific CTL responses might be useful in the development of vaccines that can prevent viral diseases. However, the currently approved alum adjuvant, which was first described by Glenny et al. [12] in 1926 and until today remains the only adjuvant approved for clinical use, is known to be effective only for the induction of humoral immunity, not for the induction of cell-mediated immunity [13]\u2013[16]. Consequently, the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant is essential for the induction of cell-mediated immunity.",

This antigen preparation was expected to be applicable for the development of tumor vaccines to induce antitumor responses and for the development of viral vaccines to induce virus-specific CTLs that effectively eliminate virus-infected cells [18]. Since the liposomal conjugates induced CTLs efficiently when CTL epitope peptides were coupled to the surfaces of liposomes [17], the liposomal conjugatesare expected to be applicable for the development of CTL-based peptide vaccines. In the development of peptide vaccines, it is essential to know whether a T helper epitope peptide is necessary for the induction of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells, an important step in vaccine preparation. This study was aimed at evaluating the role of CD4+ T cells in the induction of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells by liposome-coupled peptides.",

A significant induction of CTL specific for OVA257-264 was observed on day 4 and a complete cell killing was observed as early as 5 days after the immunization (Figure 1). Therefore, in the following experiments, primary CTL responses were monitored at 7 days after immunization. Mice were then immunized with serially diluted solution of OVA257-264-liposome conjugates containing 0.3 (8\u00d7) to 2.4 \u00b5g (1\u00d7) of peptides or OVA257-264 solution that contained equal amounts of peptides as those in liposomal conjugates. Although OVA257-264-liposome and OVA257-264 solution seemed to induce a comparable level of T-cell cytokine production at the highest dose (2.4 \u00b5g/injection), a dose-dependent decrease was observed in mice immunized with OVA257-264 solution but not in mice immunized with OVA257-264-liposome, suggesting that OVA257-264-liposome was more effective than OVA257-264 solution in the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell cytokine production (Figure 2A). Similar results were observed in T cell cytokine production; a dose of OVA257-264-liposome as low as 0.6 \u00b5g/mouse (4\u00d7 dilution) induced a perfect killing as assayed by in vivo CTL assay, while OVA257-264 solution induced only a partial killing even at the highest dose (Figure 2B).",

Mice were immunized with 50 \u00b5l of OVA257-264-liposome and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 weeks later, the mice received a booster injection with OVA. Three days after the booster injection, OVA257-264-specific cell killing was monitored. As shown in Figure 3, a complete cell killing was observed at 2 weeks after the immunization without a booster injection and, up to 20 weeks after the immunization, a significant recall response was observed upon booster injection with OVA. Inoculation of naive mice with the same dose of OVA as the booster injection (\u201cNo imm.\u201d in Figure 3) did not induce a detectable CTL response. Interestingly, a significant recall response was observed even at 20 weeks when the primary CTL response was nearly undetectable. An antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation assay further confirmed the results; as shown in Figure 4, CD8+ T cells of mice immunized with OVA257-264-liposome significantly proliferated upon in vitro stimulation with OVA even 20 weeks after immunization.",

This finding was further confirmed in CD4+ T cell-depleted mice (Figure 5). These results are in agreement with those reported previously by numerous investigators that CD4+ T cells are dispensable for the primary expansion of CD8+ T cells and their differentiation into cytotoxic effectors [2], [3], [5].

The results were consistent even when different coupling procedures for the antigens with the liposomes were employed [20]. During the course of an investigation intended to clarify the mechanism of IgE-selective unresponsiveness induced by surface-coupled liposomal antigens, we discovered an alternative approach to regulating the production of IgE, one that is independent of the activity of T cells [21]. Immunization of mice with OVA-liposome conjugates induced IgE-selective unresponsiveness without apparent Th1 polarization. Neither interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-10, nor CD8+ T cells participated in the regulation. Further, CD4+ T cells of mice immunized with OVA-liposome were capable of inducing antigen-specific IgE synthesis in athymic nude mice immunized with alum-adsorbed OVA. On the other hand, immunization of the recipient mice with OVA-liposome did not induce anti-OVA IgE production, even when CD4+ T cells of mice immunized with alum-adsorbed OVA were transferred. In the secondary immune response, OVA-liposomes enhanced anti-OVA IgG antibody production but did not enhance ongoing IgE production, suggesting that the IgE-selective unresponsiveness induced by the liposomal antigen involved direct effects on IgE but not IgG switching in vivo. These results suggest the role of an alternative mechanism, one not involving T cells, in the regulation of IgE synthesis, and raise the possibility that the surface-linked liposomal antigens are potentially applicable for the development of novel vaccines with minimal induction of IgE synthesis. Moreover, given the relatively low allergic response to and increased antigenicity of the allergen, this form of antigen preparation would be applicable for allergen immunotherapy [22].",

During the course of this investigation, a significant difference was observed in the recognition of liposomal antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) between liposomes with different lipid components [23], and this difference was closely correlated with the adjuvant activity of liposomes [24]. In addition to this \u201cquantitative\u201d difference between liposomes with different lipid components, a \u201cqualitative\u201d difference (i.e., different abilities to induce cross-presentation) was also observed between liposomes with different lipid components [17]. Although the precise mechanism underlying this difference is currently unclear, the significant difference in membrane mobility observed between these liposomes [24] might affect their ability to induce cross-presentation. Thus, by utilizing their ability to induce cross-presentation, surface-linked liposomal antigens could be used to develop virus vaccines that induce a cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response, as well as tumor vaccine preparations that present tumor antigens to APCs and induce effective antitumor responses [18].",

            "text": "Regarding the necessity of CD4+ T cells in the generation of memory CD8+ T cells, the results of the present study differed from those reported previously [1]-[5]. The difference in these findings may be due to differences in how mice were primed with antigens; in most of the studies reported previously, mice were primed by infecting viruses, such as LCMV [1], [3], [5], H3N2 influenza virus [2], and recombinant vaccinia virus [4], whereas in the present study, mice were immunized with OVA-derived CTL epitope peptides. Perhaps the difference in the requirements of CD4+ T cells observed among those studies [1]\u2013[5] and the present study was due to the difference in the efficiency of inducing the presentation of the immunodominant CTL epitope by APCs. In general, only \u223c1/2000 of the peptides in a foreign antigen expressed by an appropriate APC achieve immunodominant status with a given class I allele [25]. However, in the present study, immunization with OVA257-264-liposome successfully induced both primary and secondary CTL responses without the presence of CD4+ T cells (Figures 2 to \n\n5). In addition, it was reported previously that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes are recognized effectively by APCs and presented to T cells [24]. Therefore, although the TLR-ligand (CpG, in the present study) was necessary to mimic viral infection in order to induce CTL responses in the immunization with liposome-coupled peptides, CD4+ T cells were not required for the induction and maintenance of CD8+ memory T cells.",

For this purpose, the utilization of the immunodominant CTL epitope would be more effective than the use of an attenuated, inactivated, or subunit vaccine in the development of virus vaccines to elicit effective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses. For example, although the risk of a major global pandemic of avian influenza has created widespread concern, vaccines designed to induce antibodies against H5 haemagglutinin are expected to possess little or no efficacy, given the high rate of diversification of H5N1 strains due to the antigenic drift caused by point mutation of genes [30]\u2013[33]. On the other hand, it is known that cytotoxic T cells specific for the internal proteins NP and M1 show high cross-reactivity between strains and between subtypes, reflecting high conservation of the internal proteins [34]\u2013[37]. In addition, Lee et al. [38] recently reported that people who have not been exposed to H5N1 viruses have cross-reactive CD8+ T cell memory to a wide range of H5N1 peptides. Therefore, these peptides are expected to be used to add a CD8+ T cell component to current antibody-focused vaccine strategies with a view to reducing the impact of infection with novel influenza A viruses [39]. Epstein et al. [40] studied DNA vaccination in mice with plasmids expressing conserved nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) from an H1N1 virus. However, the DNA vaccination alone protected poorly against a highly virulent strain of H5N1 influenza viruses.",

Similar to those results reported previously [34]\u2013[37], [43], most of the CTL epitopes determined were well conserved and were identical with those involved in H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. The combined use of these CTL epitope peptides, common to influenza viruses, and the surface-linked liposomal antigens which induce long-lived memory CD8+ T cells without CD4+ T cell help, was demonstrated to be applicable for the development of a CTL-based influenza vaccine that is capable of inducing protection against heterosubtypic influenza viruses [42].",

Briefly, a mixture of 10 ml of anhydrous chloroform solution containing 0.136 mM DOPE and 24 \u00b5l of TEA was added in drops to 26.6 ml of anhydrous chloroform solution containing 0.681 mM DSS and stirred for 5 h at 40\u00b0C. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and 18 ml of a 2\u22361 mixture of ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran was added to dissolve the residue. Then, 36 ml of 100-mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) and 90 ml of saturated NaCl aqueous solution were added to the solution, shaken for 1 min, and allowed to separate. To remove undesirable materials, the upper layer was washed with the same buffer and, after evaporation of the solvent, 3 ml of acetone was added to dissolve the residue. One hundred ml of ice-cold acetone was added in drops and kept on ice for 30 min to precipitate. Crystals were collected and dissolved in 5 ml of chloroform. After evaporation, 34.4 mg of DOPE-DSS was obtained. Then, 0.18 mM DOPC, 0.03 mM DOPE-DSS, 0.21 mM cholesterol, and 0.06 mM DOPG were dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 5.8 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was added to make a 4.8% lipid suspension. The vesicle dispersion was extruded through a 0.2-\u00b5m polycarbonate filter to adjust the liposome size. A 2-ml suspension of DSS-introduced liposome and 0.5 ml of 5-mg/ml OVA peptide solution were mixed and stirred for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. The liposome-coupled- and uncoupled peptides were separated as described above using CL-4B column chromatography. The resulting solution of OVA257-264-liposome conjugates contained 47 \u00b5g/ml of peptides as assessed by amino-acid quantitative analysis done by Toray Research Center (Kanagawa, Japan).",
