The p53 primarily acts as transcription factor and stands out as a key player in restricting tumor cell invasion that includes the ability to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis [2]. Mutation in p53 results in abnormal proliferation of cells that leads to the formation of tumor development and so TP53 gene is cataloged as tumor suppressor gene [3].",

Many genomic factors such as gene length, GC-content, recombination rate, gene expression level, or modulation in the genetic code are associated with CUB in different organisms [17\u201321]. In general, compositional constraints under natural selection or mutation pressure are considered as major factors in the codon usage variation among different organisms [8,22\u201325]. Moreover, studies revealed that mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment play a major role in the codon usage pattern of organisms [26]. In unicellular and multicellular organisms it was observed that, preferred synonymous codons/optimal codons with abundant tRNA gene copy number rise with gene expression level within the genome that supports selection on high codon bias confirmed by positive correlation between optimal codons and tRNA abundance [18,22,27]. Urrutia and Hurst (2003) reported weak correlation between gene expression level and codon usage bias within human genome though not related with tRNA abundance [19]. However, Comeron (2004) observed that in human genome, highly expressed genes have preference towards codon bias favoring codons with most abundant tRNA gene copy number compared to less highly expressed genes [28].",

Codon usage bias may be superimposed on the effect of natural selection. The amount of protein produced from the mRNA transcript may vary significantly since the translational properties of alternate synonymous codons are not equivalent [31]. Several studies have further shown that codon usage bias is associated with highly expressed genes as some codons are used more often than others in the coding sequences [32]. Moreover, literature suggested that a gene can be epitomized not only by the sequence of its amino acid but also by its codon usage patterns shaped by the balance between mutational bias and natural selection [33]. As a consequence of selection pressure within a gene, differentiation in codon bias may arise between species of the same genus.",

In our analysis, nearly all codons ending with G/C base showed positive correlation with GC bias and nearly all A/T\u2014ending codons showed negative correlation with GC bias. But, 8 G/C\u2014ending codons (ATC, ACG, TAC, TTG, TCC, CAC, GTG, GGG) showed negative correlation with GC bias whereas 6 A/T-ending codons (AAT, ATT, TGT, CGA, GTA, GGA) showed positive correlation with AT bias although statistically not significant (p>0.05). Two G-ending codons i.e. TCG for serine and CTG for leucine amino acid showed strong positive correlation (p<0.01) with GC3s, indicating that codon usage has been influenced by GC bias due to GC3s. Interestingly, we observed that the codon ATA encoding isoleucine amino acid was not favored by natural selection in TP53 genes across mammalian species during the course of evolution. Thus, scanning the codon usage pattern provides the basis of the mechanism for synonymous codon usage bias and has both practical as well as theoretical significance in gaining clues of understanding molecular biology [34].",

The mean percentage of GC and AT compositions was 57.3% and 42.7% respectively. Thus, the overall nucleotide composition suggested that the nucleotide C and G occurred more frequently compared to A and T in the coding sequences of TP53 gene across the mammalian species. The nucleotide composition at the third position of codon (A3,T3,G3,C3) showed that the mean values of C3 and G3 were the highest followed by T3 and A3. The GC3 values (ranged from 58.7%-70.6%, mean = 65.1%, SD = 0.040) was compared with that of AT3 values (ranged from 29.4%-41.3%, mean = 34.9%, SD = 0.040) in the coding sequences of TP53 genes. The average percentage of GC contents at the first and second codon positions (GC12) was found in the range of 52.6% to 54.9% with a mean value of 53.4% and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.008. Therefore, nucleotide composition analysis suggested that GC\u2014ending codons might be preferred over AT\u2014ending codons in the coding sequences of TP53 genes across the selected mammalian species. Further, we calculated the occurrence of frequently used optimal codons (Fop) for each amino acid as suggested by Lavner and Kotler (2005) [14]. The frequency was allied with statistical analysis to find out the highest and lowest frequently used codon. Our results showed that the most frequently used codons were G/C\u2014ending for the corresponding amino acid (Fig. 2) in TP53 genes across mammalian species.",

In our calculation RSCU value greater than 1.0 represents that the particular codon is used more frequently and less than 1.0 represents the less frequently used codon for the corresponding amino acid. The RSCU value greater than 1.6 indicates over represented codon for the corresponding amino acid. The overall RSCU values in the selected coding sequences of TP53 gene revealed that 25 codons were most frequently used among the 59 codons and the most predominantly used codons were G/C\u2014ending compared to A/T\u2014ending (Table 2). Besides, it was observed that C\u2014ending codon was mostly favored compared to G\u2014ending codon in the coding sequence of TP53 gene among the selected mammalian species. Our results showed marked similarities as reported by Dass et al., (2012) in serotonin receptor gene family from different mammalian species [35]. Further, clustering analysis of RSCU values (Fig. 3) depicted that the codon GCC, CGC (except Rattus norvegicus), ATC (except Tupaia chinensis), CTG, ACC (except Rattus norvegicus, Macaca mulatta), GTG (except Felis catus) were displayed as the over represented codons (RSCU>1.6). The highest RSCU value was found for the codon CTG for leucine amino acid in all TP53 genes across mammalian species. The codon ATA showed the RSCU value zero because natural selection has not favored this codon in TP53 gene across mammalian species.",

However, the GC3s values ranged from 0.59 to 0.71 with a mean value of 0.65\u00b10.040. Significant negative correlation (Pearson r = -0.979, p<0.01) was observed between ENC and GC3s. Moreover, a plot of ENC vs GC3s revealed that the ENC values had negative correlation with the GC3 content (Fig. 5) and comparatively lower ENC was linked to higher GC3s values. All the selected coding sequences of TP53 gene across the selected mammalian species had a higher predominance of G/C\u2014ending codons. It suggested that GC3s values determined the codon usage pattern in the coding sequences of TP53 gene [33]. Nabiyouni et al., (2013) reported that eukaryotic organisms with very high GC-contents have high GC3-composition while organisms with low GC-content have low GC3-composition in the genome [37]. We also calculated GC3 skew values which ranged from 0.000 to -0.094, indicating that GC3 composition at the third position of codon might have played an important role in the codon usage bias [38]. Negative GC skew was observed in all the coding sequences of TP53 gene which revealed that the abundance of C over G [39]. In addition, lower values of the frequency of optimal codons (FOP) and the effective number of codons (ENC) along with higher GC contents suggested that a moderate bias exists in the usage of synonymous codons [33] for TP53 gene in different mammalian species. Predominant codon usage bias was observed in TP53 gene of M.unguiculatus compared to other mammalian species (Table 3).",

The most over-represented codon was CTG encoding the amino acid leucine in the TP53 gene of all the selected mammalian species. We further observed that the codon ATA encoding isoleucine was selected against by nature in TP53 genes across the mammalian species under study during the course of evolution.

From the outstanding work of Grantham et al., (1980\u20131981) on \u201cgenome hypothesis\u201d it was evident that species specific genes share similar spectrum of codon usage frequency [41,42]. The present study revealed that specific gene of closely related species with similar functions exhibit similar patterns of codon bias across different mammals as evident from the previous work of Dass et al., (2012) [35].
