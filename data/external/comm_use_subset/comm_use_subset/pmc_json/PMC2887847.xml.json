Leader peptides mark proteins for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and lipid modification is of major importance both for anchoring exported proteins to the membrane and for protein function [19]. It has been shown that lipidation at the first aminoacid of the mature OspA protein is essential to induce an immune response [20], [21]. In this study, we examined the influence of post-translational processing in the localization of OspA lipoprotein on the cell envelope of L. plantarum.\n",

Immunological tolerance can be exploited to develop immunotherapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases but it is also the obstacle to the development of oral vaccines [23]. As a result of our observation that an oral vaccine based in L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein induced a protective, IgG-based, immune response in mice [12] we set out to further understand the processes that determine the immunological consequences of oral administration of antigen. We investigated the role of L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein in breaking the oral tolerance of the gut and if this immune response was dependent on the lipid modification of OspA.",

Expression vectors were then transformed into L. plantarum strain 256 to obtain the clones LpA and LpAD17, respectively. Protein expression was checked by immunoblot as follows. Recombinant L. plantarum cells were disrupted with a French\u00ae press (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milford, MA), supernatants were analyzed on a 12% denaturing polyacrilamide gels and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for analysis with an OspA-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 184.1). To evaluate export and lipidation of OspA and its mutant expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus, we performed Triton X-114 phase partitioning [24]. L. plantarum cultures were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C, harvested and resuspended to an OD600 of 1.0 in PBS. Bacteria were disrupted with a French\u00ae press and the insoluble material (membrane and cell wall) was separated from the cytosol fraction by centrifugation. This cell envelope fraction was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 2% Triton-X114 (v/v) in PBS. The fractions were rotated end over end at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and were phase-separated by warming the solution for 30 min in a water bath at 37\u00b0C followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 25\u00b0C. The separated detergent and aqueous phases were each washed three times. The solutions were then rewarmed and recentrifuged as described and the detergent and aqueous phases were collected.

We treated recombinant L. plantarum with Lysozyme (Lyz) for 45 min and separated the cell wall fraction from the protoplast by centrifugation. We then disrupted the cells and separated the membrane from the cytosol fractions by ultracentifugation. The three fractions were then analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and OspA was identified by Immunoblot with anti-OspA monoclonal antibody (mAb LA2.2). Lipidated OspA expressed in L. plantarum is exported through the membrane and accumulates in the cell wall, while unlipidated OspAD17 remains mostly attached to the membrane (Fig. 3A). Next, we wanted to analyze the localization of the recombinant proteins on the surface of L. plantarum. We incubated live recombinant L. plantarum with and without Lyz and we performed both live-cell ELISA (lcELISA) and immunofluorescence (IFA) assays. For lcELISA, we incubated the recombinant L. plantarum with Lyz for 5 and 45 min, the cells were washed and incubated with mAb LA2.2 (Fig. 3B). For immunofluorescence, we performed a 30 min incubation with Lyz after which the cells were washed, incubated with mAb LA2.2 followed by Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1\u2236250). Staining was visualized using a Zeiss inverted Axiovert 200 microscope (Fig. 3C). In both assays, IFA and lcELISA, reactions without lyz (No Lyz) detect protein that is exposed on the surface of the cell. The epitope used to detect OspA and OspAD17 is located in the carboxyl terminal of the protein and is not surface exposed (Fig. 3B and 3C). Reactions with Lyz digest the peptidoglycan that releases the OspA that is trapped within the cell wall and expose OspA that is attached to the membrane (Lyz 5 min, 45 min or 30 min, Fig. 3B and 3C). Our results indicate that lipidated OspA (LpA) is trapped within the cell wall. That is, a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer (Fig. 3B) and a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a lower amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer (Fig. 3B and 3C), suggesting that OspA might not be attached to the membrane. In contrast, unlipidated OspAD17 (LpAD17) is trapped within the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, maybe attached to the membrane. That is, a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a low amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer (Fig. 3B) and a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer and the membrane (Fig. 3B and 3C).",

We have recently found that L. plantarum expressing B. burgdorferi OspA lipoprotein induced the production of OspA-specific IgA and IgG antibodies as a result of oral administration [12]. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the lipid modification of OspA in the localization of the antigen in our mucosal delivery vehicle, L. plantarum. Furthermore, we investigated how recombinant L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein breaks the oral tolerance of the gut. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of the delivery vehicle L. plantarum, and that the Cys17 is the substract for OspA lipidation. Further, we show that our recombinant L. plantarum based mucosal delivery system does not induce secretion of IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells and that it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity.",

In E. coli this lipoprotein partitions mostly into the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114 [35]. As seen in E. coli, we show that in Gram-positive L. plantarum, the leader peptide also marks OspA for translocation or export across the cytoplasmic membrane given that wildtype OspA partitions to the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114, suggesting that it is lipidated. In contrast, the mutant OspAD17, which lacks the cystein that is needed for the lipid moiety attachment, partitions mostly to the aqueous phase. This shift on the solubility of the mutant OspAD17 appears to be due to the lack of the lipid attachment, that makes the antigen more hydrophilic than the native lipidated OspA, and therefore the mutant appears to be unlipidated. It appears that OspA is indeed lipidated and localizes mostly at the membrane-cell wall interface. This observation is consistent with a previous study of Gram-positive Lactococcus spp. lipoprotein processing that found that lipid modification is predominantly required to retain proteins at the membrane cell-wall interface [36].",

Microbial invasion of the gut epithelium stimulates IECs to produce CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (IL-8) and activate other pro-inflammatory pathways that in turn coordinate the innate immune response [37]. The absence of IL-8 secretion by IECs in the presence of recombinant L. plantarum is consistent with previous findings [38], [39], [40] and suggests that an oral vaccine based in L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein would not induce the local adverse inflammatory effects attributed to pathogenic bacteria.",

Together with IECs, dendritic cells (DCs) interact with luminal bacteria [37] either through receiving M-cell delivered bacterial cargo or through extension of their own pseudopods across the IEC monolayer [42], [43], [43]. When we stimulated human PBMC-derived-dendritic-cells (PBMC/DCs) with recombinant L. plantarum expressing the OspA lipoprotein, but not the unlipidated mutant, we observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 were markedly upregulated. In addition, we observed an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. When we stimulated monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) with L. plantarum expressing lipidated OspA, but not unlipidated OspA, we observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-12 were markedly upregulated. Here too, we observed an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Differences in detection of cytokines in both assays can be explained by the fact that in the former (PBMC/DC) assay we expect to have a mixed population of monocyte derived dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and NK cells, and in the later (MDDC), we expect to have a relatively pure population of dendritic cells. These data indicate that recombinant OspA-expressing-L. plantarum stimulates the immune response via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity and that, lipidation of the antigen in the delivery agent plays an active role in this response.",

            "text": "The lipid attachment in OspA seems to be a critical determinant of the mature protein immunogenicity [35]. Furthermore, the OspA leader peptide has been fused to different proteins to generate potent lipo-antigens that induce strong B (IgG) and T-cell (helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+) responses [44], [45]. Because lipoproteins and OspA are known to trigger TLR2-based receptors [46], [47], we stimulated monocyte derived dendritic cells with purified proteins in order to access the effect of the naked protein on cytokine induction. We observed that wildtype OspA (wtOspA) induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 but it did not induce IL-12 or IFN\u03b3. In the absence of the leader peptide, as in mutOspA, the TNF\u03b1 response was abrogated and IL-10 was reduced in half. In contrast, if OspA is delivered in Lactobacillus we also observe an effect on the production of IL-12. This effect appears to be related to the delivery vehicle in which OspA is presented. Furthermore, our results show that mutation of the Cys17 on the leader peptide of OspA decreases significantly the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and that this effect is related to the lipidation of OspA. In addition, we observed that lipidation of protein is not essential to induce a specific humoral immune response to OspA (systemic IgG and mucosal IgA) when the antigen is orally delivered by Lactobacillus. The adjuvant effect of Lactobacillus as oral carrier, exerts a synergized effect along with the intrinsic antigenicity of unlipidated OspA. This result differs with others, where the lipid modification of OspA seems to be essential to induce a humoral immune response, when the soluble unlipidated antigen is delivered subcutaneously without a cellular carrier [35]. In addition, we have found that the mutation of OspA Cys17 skewed the systemic IgG production towards IgG2a, probably as result of a shift from a Th2 to a Th1 response. Over all, our data suggest that the lipidation of OspA has a clear role on the mixed Th1/Th2 cellular and humoral immune response to orally administered Lactobacillus expressing OspA.",

It is possible that mucosal tolerance may have been broken by two different mechanisms. In the first scenario, M cells might transport whole recombinant L. plantarum or OspA lipoprotein as it is released from lysed recombinant L. plantarum across the epithelium where they can induce primary immune responses [1]. In a second scenario, as dendritic cells uptake recombinant LAB and recognized it as the pathogen, the bacteria are no longer retained at the mesenteric lymphnode, as it happens when DCs are loaded with commensal bacteria, but instead migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue and present antigen to T-cells in a systemic environment that is not tolerigenic [49].",
