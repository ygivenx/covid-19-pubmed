Many research groups have presented GO-based biosensors to detect metal ions [24,25], biomolecules [26\u201328] and viruses [29]. In these previous works, GO acted as a fluorescence quencher based on the photo-induced electron transfer mechanism or electronic energy transfer mechanism without further modification. The biomolecules were attached on a GO surface through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and hydrophobic interactions but had no specificity, i.e. any protein that had an aromatic ring could be adsorbed by GO.

            "text": "We recently reported [30] a GO-based biosensor suitable for detecting proteins. We validated this approach with a generic IgG analyte. We showed that the immune reaction had specificity and that energy transfer on the antibody-conjugated GO surface could be used to quantify IgG. Here, we extend this sensing approach to tau protein sensing and demonstrate that the performance metrics are compatible with clinical needs for the diagnosis of AD. Here, the antibody-conjugated GO surface can specifically bind with both regular tau protein (analyte) and fluorescent tau-FITC (standard). Thus, it exhibits competitive binding of the two types of tau proteins. The amount of analyte tau protein controls the adsorption of tau-FITC, and hence the degree of its fluorescence quenching by GO. This change in fluorescence signal is used to measure tau in the samples via a calibration curve. In clinical practice, human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples are usually tested to measure tau concentrations. According to the literature [9,10], baseline tau protein in human CSF is usually 0\u2013100 pg ml\u22121. This increases to hundreds or even thousands of pg ml\u22121 in disease (Oka et al. [31] reported values as high as 6.3 ng ml\u22121) which is close to the limit of detection (LOD) achieved in this study (6.4 ng ml\u22121).",

This surface provides antibody-mediated specific binding sites, which are superior to other types of surfaces that rely on physical adsorption. The analyte tau441 proteins (i.e. the longest isoform of human tau protein [4], abbreviated as analyte tau below. This isoform is more representative than others because it contains all microtubule-associated groups related to the formation of PHFs [6]. It was added at increasing concentrations to buffer solutions containing antibody-conjugated GO. After adsorption of analyte tau proteins on some of the binding sites, FITC-labelled tau441 (abbreviated as tau-FITC) was also added. The GO surface is not only a nano-scale binding platform, but is also an energy acceptor [32\u201335] that quenches the fluorescence of tau-FITC. Because quenching occurs in close proximity, only the tau-FITC adsorbed on the antibody-conjugated GO became quenched [36\u201339]. As the number density of binding sites was limited to the modified GO, more adsorbed tau analyte resulted in stronger fluorescence signal from free tau-FITC in the solutions. Essentially, the analyte tau proteins control the fluorescence quenching and determine the fluorescence intensity.",

Owing to the limited number of binding sites on antibody-conjugated GO, when more analyte tau adsorbs on the GO, fewer binding sites remain for tau-FITC. Thus, more free tau-FITC will remain in solution and will produce more fluorescence. Therefore, there is a positive and quantitative correlation between analyte tau concentration and the fluorescence intensity of free tau-FITC. The assay relies on the effectiveness of GO as an energy acceptor to provide efficient fluorescence quenching. The modification of the GO surface may change the molecular orbitals of GO and affect quenching efficiency [40]; i.e. the change in GO's quenching efficiency was determined empirically. Though we have already discussed the modification process [30], we had to study the quenching efficiency every time because we changed the recognition antibody used to sense the analyte target protein.",

These three types of GO were added to standard samples containing 100 ng ml\u22121 of tau-FITC. As expected, the fluorescence of tau-FITC should decrease when tau-FITC binds to the GO surfaces. Figure 3a shows a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity with increasing amounts of bare GO. This then exhibits a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 100 \u00b5g ml\u22121 of GO. The signal change versus GO concentration is plotted in figure 3d. The transfer of energy from the excited FITC to bare GO is actually much easier than that to antibody-conjugated GO because the modification of GO with antibodies changed the electronic properties of GO turning GO into a semiconductor [40].

We took three times the value of the s.d. and divided it by the slope of 1.23 from the calibration curve to get a LOD of 6.4 ng ml\u22121 (0.14 pmol ml\u22121). While we assumed that tau-FITC proteins are all uniformly labelled with fluorescent FITCs, this may vary based on the quality of the antibodies and percentage of FITC labelling on tau [41].

Our LOD is better than the electronic sensor (the LOD is 0.2 \u00b5mol ml\u22121 [42]) and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method (the LOD is 0.618 \u00b5mol ml\u22121 [45]). The LOD of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method is better than our work (0.025 fmol ml\u22121 [43] and 1.97 fmol ml\u22121 [44]). This is because the signal of the tau protein was amplified by the SERS effect. Compared with SERS, the LOD of our method was limited by the intensity of fluorescence emitted by FITC groups on tau protein. Since the molecular weight of tau protein is over 50 kDa [7], a concentration of tau-FITC ranging 0\u2013100 pg ml\u22121 (the baseline level of tau concentration in human CSF [9,10]) means there are about 2 fmol ml\u22121 FITC groups in the solution, which is too low to be detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer. This is the main aspect that limits the current LOD of our method, which is approximately equal to the highest reported concentration of diseased state in human CSF [31]. An amplifying system of fluorescence is needed in this case in order to get a LOD ranging 0\u2013100 pg ml\u22121, which will be explored in our future studies.\n",

This discriminative binding process means that the analyte tau will be adsorbed by antibody-conjugated GO preventing fluorescein labelled tau-FITC from binding to and quenching the surface. To confirm specificity, we performed selectivity assays. We added interfering molecules such as immunoglobulin G (IgG), human serum albumin (HSA) and BSA. These were introduced to test the selectivity. In this parallel testing, the signals from solutions containing analyte tau protein and blank sample without analyte tau were compared. The results (figure 5) clearly show that the three interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal relative to blank. Only analyte tau protein showed a significant positive signal; the fluorescence intensity of other proteins was close to the blank. Analyte tau still had a positive signal even in the sample with analyte tau as well as IgG, HSA and BSA (concentration of the interfering protein is 20-fold higher than tau). This indicates that our assay design is highly selective for tau protein.\n",

This signal was quantitatively controlled by the concentration of tau analyte. Competitive binding of analyte tau and standard tau-FITC on the GO surface's limited binding sites modulates free tau-FITC in solution and hence signal. The increase in fluorescence signal (from tau-FITC) correlates directly with increasing tau concentration. The assay based on antibody-conjugated GO does not require any phase separation steps or wash steps to remove unadsorbed antibodies as in commercial ELISA procedures. Thus, our assay benefits from fewer reagents, lower cost, and less systematic and human errors. The LOD is about 0.14 pmol ml\u22121, which could be improved further. The sensing mechanism in this work could become a viable immunosensor platform for the detection of tau protein and may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of AD or other tau-induced neurodegeneration syndromes.",
