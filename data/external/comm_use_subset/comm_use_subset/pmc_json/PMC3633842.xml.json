            "text": "Low birth weight (LBW) (birth weight <2500 g) newborns suffer from higher infection, morbidity and mortality rates than normal birth weight (NBW) (birth weight \u22652500 g) newborns [1]\u2013[3]. Over 20 million newborns worldwide, representing 15.5% of all births, are LBW, of which, 95.6% are in developing countries [4]. LBW newborns may be either term LBW (intrauterine growth restriction; gestation age \u226537 weeks) or pre-term (gestation age <37 weeks) newborns. The percentages of term LBW newborns are very high with estimates of nearly 75% in Asia, 20% in Africa and approximately 5% in the Latin America [5]. India has highest number of LBW infants born each year, representing 40 percent of the global burden, of which, three-fourths are born at term [6]. LBW neonates have high morbidity from diarrhea and their risk of death is estimated to be four to ten times higher than NBW newborns [2], [7]. LBW newborns are also known to contract life-threatening diseases like pneumonia or acute lower respiratory infections at a rate almost twice than that of NBW newborns [8]. Differences in the immune responses between newborns and adults, and between preterm and term newborns, have been reported [9]\u2013[12]. LBW, irrespective of the gestational age, may also influence immune mechanisms. However, the variations in the immune status between term LBW and NBW newborns is only partially understood as there are only a few studies available in this area which focus primarily on comparing immunoglobulin classes, complement levels, T- and B-cell counts. It has been shown that LBW newborns have lower levels of IgG [13], [14], [15], impaired early IgA and IgM synthesis [15], and lower T- and B- lymphocyte percentage [13], [16], [17] than the NBW newborns, whereas little is known about their potential differences in innate immunity. A larger picture comprising exact components and mechanisms involved in defective innate immune signaling in term LBW newborns remains yet to be drawn. We therefore undertook this study targeting the global gene expression to obtain a fuller view of distinct immune system of LBW newborns. We performed gene expression microarray analysis of cord blood cells and identified interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) significantly down-regulated in LBW newborns. Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling and IFN signaling were the most significantly down-regulated in LBW newborns. Other significantly affected bio-functions and disease categories in the LBW newborns were infectious disease, respiratory diseases, antimicrobial response, inflammatory response, antigen presentation, hematological system development and functions, and immune cell trafficking. In addition, many immune response related genes like granzymes and bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI) protein were also seen to be down-regulated in the LBW newborns. Further, the IFNs and BPI protein were also confirmed to be less produced in response to toll-like receptor (TLR)-8 signaling in LBW newborns. The information obtained from this study may provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the underdeveloped immune response in the term LBW newborns and their increased susceptibility to infections. Further in-depth investigations on the novel target molecules identified through this study may pave the way for the development of more precise and targeted therapies that can protect the LBW newborns from life threatening infections.",

After second-strand synthesis, the cDNA was purified with the GeneChip sample cleanup module (Affymetrix). Further, in-vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA from double-stranded cDNA was carried out using the GeneChip IVT labeling Kit (Affymetrix).

These focus genes in LBW newborns were selected for generating canonical pathways, bio-functions, and networks. Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways that were most significant in the data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured using a ratio of the number of genes from the data set that map to the pathway to the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway and Right-tailed Fisher's exact test. The networks with the highest scores and focus molecules were identified by IPA network analysis and displayed graphically as a collection of nodes (genes/gene products) and edges (the biological relationships between the nodes). The intensity of the node colors indicates the degree of up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (green). Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges are displayed with various labels that describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes. The score is derived from a p-value and indicates the likelihood of the focus genes in a network being found together because of random chance. A score of 2 or higher indicates at least a 99% confidence level of not being generated by random chance alone. The biological functions are then calculated and assigned to each network.",

            "text": "Down-regulation of a large spectrum of PRRs involved in the \u2018role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses\u2019 pathway suggest impaired innate immune signaling against the invading pathogens in the LBW newborns. C5aR (cytosolic PRR) is the receptor for an anaphylatoxin C5a which chemoattracts granulocytes particularly the neutrophils at the site of infection and contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation and sepsis [21], [22]. Reduced expression of C5aR on neonatal neutrophils contributes to poor chemotaxis and transmigration compared to adult neutrophils [23]. TLR-1 and -5 (extracellular PRRs) mainly recognize bacterial products, whereas TLR-8 (intracellular PRR) can detect both bacterial and viral products [24], [25]. Although basal TLR expression of full-term newborns blood monocytes is comparable to that of adults [9], [26] the status of expression of TLRs among term LBW newborns has not been studied so far. In this study, we found that the basal expression of TLR-1, TLR-5, and TLR-8 at mRNA and TLR-5 and TLR-8 at protein level is down-regulated in LBW newborns as compared to NBW newborns. Although direct evidence of TLR-1and TLR-5-mediated protection of newborns against infection is not available, a study in adults reports that individuals with low expression of TLR-1 were hypo-responsive to vaccination against Lyme disease [27] and TLR-5 signaling has a protective role against pneumococcal infection in mice [28]. TLR-8 agonists are potent inducer of cytokines in newborns and implicated as a candidate vaccine adjuvant in both early life and adulthood [29], [30]. Decreased TLR-8 expression in monocytes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected newborns dampens early anti-viral cytokine production [31]. Low production of BPI protein as observed in LBW newborns might be due to the impaired TLR-8 signaling as TLR-8 is known to induce the type1 IFN such as IFN-\u03b2 through IRF7 [25] which in turn induces BPI protein in mice [32]. Thus, our observation that TLR8, IFNs, and BPI are down-regulated in the LBW newborns is supported by the above studies. Defective cytokine responses due to impaired TLR signaling correlates with heightened risk from excessive inflammation and clinical patterns of susceptibility to disease in prematurely born infants [33]. Furthermore, diminished expression of TLRs and their signaling increases severity of diseases [31], [34] and seems to be an important immune evasion mechanism for some microbial pathogens [35].",

IRFs are key transcription factors involved in PRRs and IFN signaling and their reduced expression could have direct influence on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. RIG-1 and MDA-5 are cytosolic PRRs that sense viral infections through recognition of viral dsRNA leading to activation of TBK and IKK-\u03b1 and result in induction of type I IFNs through activation of IRF-7 transcription factor. Induction of type I IFNs, in turn, induces the apoptosis of virus-infected cells and provides cellular resistance to virus infection [36], [37]. Additionally, activation of type I IFNs leads to transcription of ISGs like ISG-15 and ISG-54 through JAK/STAT pathway that result in an antiviral response in infected and neighboring cells [38], [39], [40]. The reduced production of IFN-\u03b1 significantly increases the risk of recurrent wheezing in newborn [41]. The impaired IFN-\u03b1 production is reported in cord blood and in the blood of 4-day's old baby at mRNA and protein levels [42]. Furthermore, defective expression of type I IFN genes are associated with impaired translocation of IRF7 in cord blood [43]. Down-regulation of PRRs and IRFs implicated in this pathway could impair cytosolic recognition of viral particles and may lead to low production of IFNs as we have observed in LBW newborns the low production of IFN-\u03b1 in response to R-848 in LBW newborns. This suggest that the down-regulation of these PRRs and their effector molecules have potential role in the outcome of infections in LBW newborns.",

It serves to inhibit ribosomal translation of cellular and viral proteins, ultimately terminating viral replication in the cell and inducing apoptosis [44]. PKR, a member of eIF2 kinase family, is activated by dsRNA, and arrests cellular and viral protein synthesis by limiting viral replication through phosphorylation of the \u03b1 subunit of eIF-2 [45], [46]. Given that eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation is crucial for virus-induced translation termination [47] and apoptosis [48], [49] down-regulation of PKR and other members of eIF2 signaling may provide a favorable ground for progression of viral infection in the LBW newborns. Additionally, the reduced expression of a large number of small and large ribosomal proteins implicated in eIF2 signaling may suggest severe translational dysfunction in the host cell resulting in lower turnover of cellular proteins which may be an indication of developmental insufficiency.",

IFNs are multifunctional cytokines that mediate their effects via transcription of ISGs and play an essential role in host immunity by inhibiting the replication and spread of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens [50]. The down-regulated ISGs in LBW newborns such as PKR/EIF2AK2, myxovirus resistance-1 (MX-1), ribonuclease L (RNaseL), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-1, -2, and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) are some of the best studied ISGs and function as antiviral effectors [51]. IFIT-1, IFIT-2, IFIT-3, and IFIT-5, which were found to be the most down-regulated genes in LBW newborns, are induced in response to type I and type II IFNs against viral infections [52], [53]. It has been demonstrated that IFIT-1 recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA of viral origin and is involved in efficient antiviral activity in the presence of all three family members (IFIT-1, IFIT-2 and IFIT-3) forming an IFN dependent multi-protein complex [53]. Furthermore, IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 have been reported to regulate virus-triggered type I IFN signaling [54] and LPS induced excessive TNF-\u03b1 expression [55] respectively, thus, offering protection to host against cellular damage caused by excessive release of cytokines. Interestingly, IFIT's ability to recognize the nucleic acid from a variety of yet-unidentified microbes has been proposed as analogous to the role of TLRs [53]. The antiviral role of IFITs and other ISGs has not been studied earlier in newborns. The observed down-regulation of these genes in the LBW newborns might help explain the severe outcome of viral infections compared to the NBW newborns. These findings may be extended to investigate the roles and interplay of ISGs in the weakened immune response in the LBW newborns.",

Moreover, the risk of infections in LBW newborns is not only very high in the perinatal period but is also linked to onset of long term chronic diseases in the adulthood like respiratory complications including wheezing, coughing and pulmonary infections [58]\u2013[61]. LTB4R, CAMP, LTF, and BPI genes were found to be implicated in SARS affected patients [62]. Nucleic acid-sensing PRRs including RIG-1, MDA-5, TLR-8 were found to be associated with acute bronchiolitis in infants [63]. Decreased TLR-8 expression has been correlated with increased lower respiratory tract RSV-infection in the infants [31]. Down-regulated genes in the infectious disease category are involved with replication of Flavivirus, Reovirus, Picorna virus, Orthomyxovirus etc. [64], [65]. The PRRs play important roles in managing these viral infections as RIG-1 and MDA-5 are reported to recognize viral components of Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, which belong to the Flaviviridae family, and induce type I IFNs [66]\u2013[68].",

The possible mechanism involved in these processes include activation, infiltration, chemotaxis, and recruitment of various leukocytes like myeloid, granulocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages at the sites of infections. The observed down-regulation of chemokine (CCL4) and chemokine receptors (CCR1, CXCR2, CX3CR1, C5aR) could impair the proper inflammatory response at the site of infection as they play a crucial role in immune cell trafficking [69]. C5aR, CCR1 and CXCR2 regulate leukocyte trafficking [22], [70], [71]. Similarly, CCL4 which acts on neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, plays a pivotal role in the development, function, and homeostasis of the immune system of the host [70]. Furthermore, CXCR2 is predominantly responsible for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection [71] whereas, the CX3CR1 receptor regulates infiltration of peripheral macrophages and, plays important role in immune surveillance [72]. This suggests that the down-regulation of chemokines and chemokine receptors may cause the impaired recruitment of leukocytes at the site of infection.",

            "text": "Reduced expressions of granzymes and BPI in LBW newborns are also linked with antimicrobial responses. Granzymes are produced by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells and, are released upon interaction with target cells. To date, five different granzymes have been described in humans: granzymes A, B, H, K and M [73]. Wang et al noted low expression of granzyme B due to reduced activity of cord blood NK cells [74]. This finding together with our result provides support for suggesting that the LBW newborns may have low NK cell activity reflected by decreased expression of granzymes and granzyme B in particular. BPI, an important antimicrobial polypeptide, is derived from primary granules of neutrophils [75], and to a lesser extent from eosinophils [76]. BPI has high affinity for the endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria and exhibits a cytotoxic activity against them [77]\u2013[79]. BPI protein helps the host body in fighting with gram negative bacteria by targeting its opsonization, by neutralizing LPS mediated inflammatory responses, and through microbicidal activity [80]. Neonatal cord blood neutrophils have less (3\u20134 fold) intracellular BPI than the adults and this deficiency is correlated with diminished neutrophil activity against E.coli K1/r [81]. We have shown that production of BPI protein was significantly lower in response to R-848 in LBW newborns compared to NBW newborns. Moreover, BPI protein in unstimulated culture supernatant was also significantly lower in LBW newborns compared to NBW newborns however, the unstimulated culture supernatant of NBW newborns and adults were comparable. This may be an indication of impaired immune status of LBW newborns. The down-regulation of BPI detected in LBW newborns is suggestive of weakened neutrophil functions in LBW newborns.",

Ongoing functional investigations focused on the deficient immune factors identified through this study may provide valuable information on the possible underlying mechanisms of increased susceptibility to infection in the term LBW newborns. Although dangers of administering new molecules to newborns are of utmost importance, development of innate immune system mediated adjunctive therapy targeting the genes identified in these pathways and biofunctions may help protect the LBW newborns from the enhanced susceptibility and severity of infections. Further, research into PRRs especially TLR-mediated immunity in this area may have great relevance to clinical practice.",
