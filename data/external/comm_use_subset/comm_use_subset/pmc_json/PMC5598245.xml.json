            "text": "Quickly measuring transmissibility of an emerging respiratory infectious disease is vital to preparedness of authorities and design of the optimal intervention strategies. The key quantity that characterises the transmissibility is the basic reproductive number (R\n0), the average number of new infections caused by a single infective individual introduced into a completely susceptible population.1 It is a threshold parameter: if R\n0<1, the disease dies out without any intervention; otherwise, the disease can persist. To monitor how transmissibility evolves and whether the countermeasures can reduce the transmission along the outbreak course, the effective reproduction number (R\nt) is also a useful parameter. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak, especially the 2009 pandemic flu, effort has been made to rapidly estimate the reproductive number and many statistical methods2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were proposed for this task. Fortunately, these methods have now been made in publicly available software.8, 9\n",

Multiple introductions to the human population have occurred from the animal reservoir in the Middle East, with person\u2010to\u2010person transmission well documented in healthcare and household settings. Sporadic, exported cases have been reported in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America since, with cases linked with returning travel from the Middle East. Although limited transmission was reported in these other regions, no sustained onward transmission has been detected outside of the Middle East until 2015. MERS\u2010CoV transmissibility has been estimated to be around the threshold value of 1.0, ranging from 0.4 to 1.5.10, 11, 12 These estimates are mainly based on sporadic cases and self\u2010limited clusters.13 However, the estimation14 on a large healthcare\u2010associated outbreak in Jeddah and Riyan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during spring 2014, with over 300 cases, suggested a higher R\n0 ranging from 2.0 to 6.7.",

It has been the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East so far,15 and much theoretical attention has been attracted to estimate its transmissibility. Hsieh16 used a phenomenological model to obtain an estimate of R\n0 ranging from 7.0 to 19.3. Xia et al.17 and Kim et al.18 used transmission dynamics models and obtained R\n0 = 4.4 and 5.4, respectively. Reconstructing the transmission tree and considering the heterogeneity in the transmission processes, Nishiura et al.19 estimated that the reproductive number throughout the whole outbreak has a mean of about 1.0 and a variance of 52.1 (it is worth mentioning that the mean reproductive number throughout the outbreak course is of no help for understanding the transmissibility of the causing pathogens).* These estimates differ from the studies based on previous MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks10, 11, 12 and show a quite diverse picture of R\n0 for the ROK outbreak. In general, the transmissibility depends not only on the biological properties of a pathogen such as transmission mode and infectivity, but also on the susceptibility and contact patterns of the host populations.1 The difference in transmissibility among different locations and ethnic populations highlights the importance of its setting dependency. It implies that given the same infectivity of a pathogen, the size and duration of the outbreaks it causes will depend on the contact patterns of the population attributable to their culture\u2010associated behaviours or geographical\u2010related environment. Different from Westernised culture, Koreans have the tradition to visit relatives and friends in hospitals and can choose the hospitals that they think are the best for their treatment. This culture\u2010associated behaviour along with increased infectivity in hospital environment10, 20 may have facilitated the spread of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK.21\n",

Both assume that the hospitalised patients can transmit infection to others, which is not true in the ROK outbreak where no infection was caused by confirmed cases as they were all isolated after the confirmation.21 Further, they both fixed the transition rates so that the stage durations (e.g incubation period and delay from symptom onset to hospitals) were implicitly assumed to be exponential. This is also not true as the observed stage durations are non\u2010exponentially distributed (see Appendix S1). They used the least\u2010square methods to estimate the model parameters, which, in view of a huge amount of uncertainty and heterogeneity in the outbreak,19 may not be appropriate. To comprehensively understand how these variations affect the estimation of transmissibility, a more general methodology such as Bayesian inference is needed which combined case data and the priors extracted from previous studies or direct estimates from the outbreak data.",

This suggests that the effectively breaking point took place on 28th or 29th May. This is in agreement with the result of Hsieh16 who fitted the Richards model to cumulative case data. Transmission dynamics modelling suggests the reproductive number before the intervention (R\n0) has median 9.11 and 95% CI [5.32, 15.92] with the breaking point at 28th May (or 6.85 [4.13, 11.92] if the breaking point is at 29th May) for the model assuming both contact rate and diagnosis rate vary with the breaking point (Table 1 and Table C1 in Appendix S3). For the model that assumes only contact rate varies with the breaking point, the estimates of R\n0 are: 6.07 [4.20, 8.70] (5.36 [3.76, 7.60]) (see Tables C2 and C3 in Appendix S3).

From the sample transmission tree listed in Figure 4, we found R\ng reduced quickly, from initially R\ng = 28 to R\ng = 4.43 with a large standard deviation of 16.2 on the second generation and on the third generation the mean of R\ng became below the threshold level: R\ng = 0.27 with a moderate standard deviation of 1.16. Approximating R\n0 by averaging R\nt before 28th May (the breaking point), the mean and 95% CI are 5.2 [3.3, 7.5] and 6.2 [2.8, 14.6] by the methods of Wallinga and Teunis2 and Hens et al.7 respectively. The two methods obtained the similar mean but quite different variations. The reason is that Wallinga and Teunis2 implicitly assumed that the population is well mixing and that the probability of one case being an infector of another cases is only determined by the gap in symptom\u2010onset dates between the two cases. This difference also reflects the superspread: most infections are caused by a few of infections, while many other infections cause none.",

Our dynamics models indicate that the transmission process experiences an effectively breaking point at 28 or 29 May 2015 in contact and diagnosis rates. In view of the intervention timeline shown in Figure 1, this effective breaking point indicates that both quarantining close contacts and informing the public the actual situation of outbreak could be the main countermeasures. Before this breaking point, R\n0 could range from 5.4 to 9.1 depending on the day of the breaking point. These estimates well overlap with the statistical estimates.

Understanding how these factors impact the transmission process can provide further information for the outbreak.

To identify how Korean culture\u2010associated behaviour affects the spread, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and setting\u2010dependent transmission dynamics. Even with these limitations, our dynamics model roughly catches the basic characteristics of the transmission dynamics during the ROK outbreak as evidenced by the agreement of its R\n0 estimate with statistical methods and reasonable identification of breaking point in contact and diagnosis rates.

This suggests another reason why the transmissibility of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK is much higher than the previous analyses because all the transmission events during the ROK outbreak were observed to occur in hospitals. This in return lends evidence that the healthcare environment is fertile soil for the transmission of MERS\u2010CoV14 and hints the importance of strengthening hospital infection control programmes.",

The second factor reduces contacts, implying that keeping the community informed the true outbreak situation is important for control. The two interventions (self\u2010protection and quick diagnosis) might be accomplished by different people: the latter can only be accomplished by those who became ill and their close contacts while everyone in the system can change their behaviours to become self\u2010protected. In reality, it is likely that these two effects initiated in separate moments; however, the separate breaking points may not much impact the results as indicated in Table 3: the model variant that assumes only time\u2010varying self\u2010protection performs nearly as good as the best model that assumes time variation in both self\u2010protection and diagnosis rate.

Anticipation of novel virus species must be included in public health planning. Although we cannot predict their severity and transmissibility, learning from the past outbreaks and thus training our public health service system is an important part of our preparedness. One key lesson learned from the past outbreaks of emerging pathogens including SARS, Ebola and MERS\u2010CoV is the setting\u2010dependent transmissibility. For any potentially oncoming novel pathogens, it is hard (if possible at all) to predict their biological properties. The only strategy that can use as countermeasures is to reduce the contact rates such as closing mass gatherings and avoiding any unnecessary contacts. Hence, the knowledge is crucial about what changes in human behaviour and contact patterns help reduce the chance of their emergence and outbreak, or can avoid their rapid and large\u2010scale diffusion among populations. Nevertheless, hospitals are clearly important settings for amplifying transmissibility,37 many of which cases will be hospitalised, thus increasing the risk of exposing healthcare workers and other patients. This highlights the importance of ensuring the early implementation of adequate infection control measures around severe cases to minimise such onward transmission.",
