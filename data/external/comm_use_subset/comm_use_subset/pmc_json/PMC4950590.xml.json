Leading the Asian healthcare renaissance is China due to uninterrupted economic emancipation and intensified government\u2019 effort to construct the social safety nets needed to reduce excessive inequality in access to healthcare in China and beyond [2]. The prevalence of health inequality in China is highlighted in several studies particularly in the recent publications of the World Health Organization, Institute for Health Economics of the Ministry of Health in China and international and regional humanitarian agencies including Medicine without Borders, the Red Cross Society etc [3]. All of these studies present a gloomy report of a national healthcare sector that is skewed in favour of the rich eastern provinces (Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong etc) relative to the poorer western provinces (Tibet, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Qinghai etc) [3].",

Predictably, China achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history. This success was attained owing to strong public support for government intervention in health care, renewed political commitment from top leaders, heavy government subsidies, fiscal capacity backed by China\u2019s economic power, healthcare financing and policy responsibilities delegated to local governments and pragmatic implementation strategy for health equality [5].",

The disparities extend beyond the provincial level to include health inequity among migrant and resident population and genders. Typical of most equality induced healthcare reforms, China\u2019s approach to bridging the gap has largely focused on curbing disparities in health insurance coverage [7, 8], legal barriers [9], structural barriers [10], disproportionate health care financing system [11], linguistic barriers [12], health illiteracy [13], financial constrains [14], demographic factors [15] and lack of healthcare facilities and personnel [16].",

In China, the healthcare market has steadily attracted a lot of attention from investors (within and outside China) eyeing countercyclical stories and demographic trends that are less affected by the vagaries of currency risk and monetary policy [22]. This is also in response to the growing opportunities in the sector as wealthier elites are willing to spend more for better healthcare [1]. Despite the initial sell-off in the early 2000s, China\u2019s healthcare stocks as measured by the MSCI China Health Care Index bounced back substantially in mid 2002 following greater foreign investment. This was also boosted by an increase in medical supply arising out of the outbreak of zoonotic infections such as the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which ravaged through China in 2003. Other factors which sustained the upsurge in healthcare stock prices over a considerable period of time include enhanced medical supply and profit from the outbreak of the pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in 2007 and the Haemagglutinin (1) and Neuraminidase (1) (H1N1) influenza in 2009 [23]. Thus the nearly 15 % healthcare stock return achieved between 2003 and 2012 by China was only equaled by the healthcare stocks in Japan while health-care stocks around other Asian countries remained lower or unchanged [24\u201326].",

Similarly, Luye Pharma Group Ltd, a Singaporean-owned-Shanghai-listed researcher and producer of both natural drugs and chemical drugs with new formulations for use in orthopedics, neurology, gastroenterology and hepatology expects more positive returns on investments. Further, the Templeton Asset Management report posited that with the Chinese increasing their surveillance and quality control a lot of these saleable products in the domestic healthcare sector will become saleable globally and this will expand the market. Even though currently Chinese health-care stocks are generally commanding premium values to their peers in other emerging markets, a series of market fluctuations occurring intermittently (and more visibly between 2014 and 2015) in the Chinese healthcare stock market suggest that the market is susceptible to investors procyclical or herding behaviours.

However, [28] argues that as China\u2019s economic growth rate begins to tumble and the presence of strict regulations intensify, many investors both individual and institutions have become more concerned about capital preservation, and are responding by abandoning long term investments strategies in the healthcare sector. Some have also reduced the risk exposure and switched to safer asset classes with the intention of switching back as soon as the market condition improves. Bohl et. al. [29] also explain that the trend is escalating because investors are imitating each other largely due to the strong social network which has become an unrivaled heritage of the Chinese business culture.",

Understanding the \u2018herding effect\u2019 on the healthcare sector is an important issue because endemic herding tendencies can have destabilizing impacts on the healthcare sector such as price synchronicity of stocks and healthcare products and services [33, 34] and even market crash [35].

These were based on studies conducted on equities in the US, international equities, commodity futures traded on European exchanges, Exchange Traded Funds and Chinese stocks respectively.

These studies are inconsistent with the test of herd behavior in the domestic loan market by [45] that extended the LSV herding measure proposed by [46] within a Japanese market. On the whole, the empirical evidence of herd behavior in the extant literature provides a general indication of the fact that stock markets in general and China in particular are less informationally efficient relative to the efficient market hypothesis hence the need for a study that extends the applicability of the market efficiency hypothesis.

For example [47] explored the neural and psychological basis of herding in purchasing books online with sixteen students selected from the Zhejiang University in China while [48] examined the influence of herd behavior in C2C e-commerce in China. The closest application of herding behavior in the healthcare sector are all outside China and are equally intended to explore its usefulness as information gathering mechanism for decision making which is sometimes at variance with the evidence based decision making process. For example [49] explores herding behavior as a psychosocial factor in quarantine during epidemic and how it can help ensure successful control while, [50] has applied herding behavior to how hospitals can form strategic groups in order to remain stable. Using a game-theoretical reflections [51] empirically validates the view that herding behavior can be used to appeal to free-riders to adopt pro-social behaviours in vaccine advocacy. Similarly, herding behavior is tested by [52] as a strategic management concept that can be used for hospital leadership and management while [53] identifies the negative aspects of herding behavior as an information aggregation system in healthcare relative to evidence based medicine. He warns healthcare institutions not to rush to implement policies and programs by merely following what contemporaries are doing. While all of the above studies have taken place outside China, these ground breaking attempts to draw on a field once thought to be purely economics and finance to the administration of mainstream healthcare is inspirational hence our attempt to advance the frontiers of the application of herding behavior in the healthcare sector by focusing on healthcare stock market and its potential implication for the whole healthcare market in China.",

To the best of our knowledge, the most recent effort at studying herding behavior in a specific industry in China are by [56] and [57] who focused on herding behavior in the housing industry in China. In both cases they employ different set of methodologies (least squares method and quantile regression method) which are totally different from those employed in this study. We extend the frontiers of current knowledge from the general (market) to the specific (industry) by empanelling and testing an ensemble of more sophisticated analytical models from the extant literature (cross sectional standard deviations-CSSD and cross sectional absolute deviations-CSAD on Chinese healthcare stock market. The results are then compared with our augmented State Space Model (which we call State Space Model 2) which is an enhancement on the existing State Space Model (which we call State Space Model I) in order to examine their respective statistical powers and subsequent robustness of inference. Understanding which models (summarized in the next section) yield herding behavior may provide information about the ways in which investors herd, the subsector with the greatest susceptibility to herding and its impact on health equity in particular and healthcare policy as a whole.",

This may answer an important question posed by [59]; who expressed uncertainty as to whether herd formation would more likely occur at the level of investment in stock groups (such as stocks in an industry) where investors face similar decision problems and can observe the behaviour of others in the group (see also [60]). Further the market has seen tremendous interest by foreign investors. Because domestic individual investors usually lack the professional knowledge and skill to access accurate information easily [54, 60, 61], the resulting information asymmetry may encourage such individual investors to follow the actions of the crowd including more informed institutional and foreign investors especially in high collectivist culture such as China.",

The first evidence of the use of CSSD in testing herd behavior is presented by [37] who used the CSSD to measure the average proximity of returns of individual asset to the realized market average. Similarly a non-linear regression specification of the CSAD has been used by [38, 39, 62] to examine how the level of equity return dispersions relates to the overall market return. Other studies which have successfully used the CSAD approach in herd behavior measurement (albeit differences in markets) include [26, 40, 41, 60, 61].

This measure also represents the individual security return dispersion around the market average. The fundamental idea in this model is based on the argument that herd behavior prevents security returns from deviating far from the overall market return. This is because of the assumption that individuals are likely to suppress their personal beliefs and invest solely on the basis of collective actions of the market. Using the rational asset pricing models however give a different prediction that suggest that dispersions increases with changes in the absolute value of market return. This is because it is assumed that each asset is different as far as sensitivity to the market return is concerned. Additionally this model also implies that herd behavior may likely occur when market movements become extreme because they will usually go with the market consensus during such periods. Thus the behavior of the dispersion measure in (1) during periods of market stress is examined by estimating the following linear regression model:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ CSS{D}_t=\\alpha +{\\beta}_D{D}_t^L+{\\beta}_U{D}_t^U+{\\varepsilon}_t $$\\end{document}CSSDt=\u03b1+\u03b2DDtL+\u03b2UDtU+\u03b5twhere DtL = 1, if the aggregate market portfolio return on day t lies in the lower tail of the return distribution; 0 otherwise, and DtU = 1, if the aggregate market portfolio return on day t lies in the upper tail of the return distribution; 0 otherwise. Despite a concern that this may be arbitrary, this is supported in the current literature [54, 56, 59] where extreme market return is defined a return lying between one to five percent lower or upper tail of the return distribution. Moreover, the dummies in Eq. (2) seek to capture the return dispersion differences in periods of extreme market movements. Since the formation of herd behavior implies conforming to the market consensus, the presence of negative and statistically significant \u03b2D (for down markets) and \u03b2U (for up markets) coefficients gives an indication of herd behavior among the market participants.",

Instead of focusing on returns to measure herding behavior, the focus is rather on the cross-sectional variability of factor sensitivities.

In equilibrium, only \u03b2 is needed to price an asset i. When there is herding behavior investors have no regard for equilibrium relationship of Eq. (5) hence trade to match the return of individual assets with that of the market. This gives a bias \u03b2 term and expected rate of return reflecting the matching of individual asset returns with that of the market. Thus with CAPM, the presence of herding behavior means that the real \u03b2 coefficient obeys Eq. (6) by replacing Eq.

In general, [61, 63] argues that when (0 < hmt < 1), then some degree of herding exist in the market but the intensity depends on the magnitude of hmt. Since the form of herding behavior being discussed is a market-wide behavior and it is assumed that Eq. (6) holds for the total assets in the market, the level of herding can be estimated with the total assets in the market instead of a single asset and this removes the effects of idiosyncratic movements in any individual \u03b2imtb.

Each of these stocks is further sub classified into one of 14 subcategories of the healthcare sector (healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, medical supplies & distribution, pharmaceuticals diversified, pharmaceuticals generic and specialty, biotechnology, managed health care, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and research, advanced medical equipment manufacture, healthcare transportation, therapeutic medicine, medical tourism and other medical support services) as shown in Table 1. This helps to verify whether a group is more likely to herd if trade is sufficiently homogeneous, i.e. each member faces a similar decision problem, and each member can see the trades of other group members [59]. As the years 2004, 2009 and 2014 witnessed periods of rapid foreign investment in Chinese healthcare market (because of policy incentives), data for the periods and share of foreign investment in all subsectors is highlighted. This is because the presence of foreign investors is seen as a significant precursor to herd formation [63]. The portfolio returns based on an equally weighted portfolio of all companies in the respective subsectors were then calculated. The information in Table 2 shows the summary statistics for average returns daily log, return dispersion and the average number of companies used to calculate these statistics for each sub-sector. Since the number of shares in a sector does not remain constant over time, the table shows the average number of companies during the sampling period in the second column of the table. Panel A shows that the average daily returns for all subsectors are positive. Other medical support services (4.184) and medical tourism (4.106) subsectors have the highest average daily return volatility based on the standard deviation of average daily returns. Panel B of Table 2 shows the summary statistics for daily cross sectional standard deviations within each subsector. In line with the results of Panel A, we observe higher volatility cross section in medical tourism.",

Similarly, Table 6 shows that subsectors such as healthcare facilities, medical equipment manufacture, pharmaceuticals diversified, biotechnology, diagnostic substances and healthcare transportation sub sectors have dispersion of the betas for all assets in the market (Stdc(\u03b2imtb) that increases as market volatility rises since the coefficients for the market volatility term (log \u03c3mt) have significant and positive values.

This stems from the fact that consequential scarcity of healthcare resources will lead to disproportionate allocation of few resources to China dependent countries. Coupled with the expected increase in the cost of the available healthcare resources such as drugs and other supplies (due to scarcity), the resulting high cost of healthcare may likely be monumental as most of these ASEAN and African countries continue to reel under heavy economic challenges at both national and individual level.

In reviewing the literature, we found out that recent pressure on pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks in China following the announcement by the China National Development and Reform Commission ordering price cuts for certain drugs after a government reimbursement scheme for some drugs was note well implemented. This is what led to a sudden hike in the price of healthcare products and subsequently healthcare stocks.",

We noted the prevalence of herding behavior in almost all the healthcare sector in China using different testing models. This is the first study to compare the effects of different empirical models of herding in the healthcare sector in China in its developing state. More importantly the existence of herding behavior in the health stock market provides significant implication for the healthcare sector and healthcare delivery in China and beyond especially for most countries that depend on China for several medical services and equipments. We have adequately discussed implications of the research for health equity in China and beyond and made policy recommendations. The results inspire curiosity on other remote factors that can trigger disequilibrium in the allocation of healthcare resources in other emerging markets.",
