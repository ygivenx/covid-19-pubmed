For more than six decades, this organism has played an integral role in the biodefense community as a simulant for biological warfare and bioterrorism events (BW) and is commonly referred to by its military two-letter designation \u201cBG\u201d [1], [2]. B. atrophaeus has served in studies of agent dispersal [3], decontamination simulations [4], [5] and large-scale process development [6]. In addition to its historical use as a BW simulant, it is currently in widespread commercial use as a surrogate for spore-forming bacteria [5], [7] and is the basis of numerous assays for spore inactivation [8], [9]. In addition to its role as a simulant, the organism plays an important role in the biotechnology industry as a source of restriction endonucleases and of the glycosylation inhibitor nojirimycin [10].",

Originally isolated as B. globigii in 1900 (Migula) as a variant of B. subtilis, it was originally distinguished from B. subtilis by the formation of a black-tinted pigment on nutrient agar and by low rates of heterologous gene transfer from B. subtilis\n[11]. It has been alternately known as B. subtilis var. niger, B. niger, and has been confused with B. licheniformis\n[12]. Other than the formation of the dark pigment, it is virtually indistinguishable from B. subtilis by conventional phenotypic analysis [13], and the lack of distinguishing metabolic or phenotypic features has contributed to the confusionin the taxonomic placement of this organism. Low interspecies DNA transfer frequencies suggested substantial divergence [11]. Based onanalysis of comparative DNA hybridization, phenotypicand biochemical tests, Nakamura advocated that pigment-producing B. subtilis-like isolates should be classified as a distinct species termed B. atrophaeus\n[13]. Recently, more sensitive typing methods such as amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that B. atrophaeus strains could be classified into two major biovars: var. globigii encompassing the classical, commonly used BG isolates, and var. atrophaeus encompassing other closely related yet genetically distinct strains [14].",

All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at http://www.jgi.doe.gov/. The initial draft assembly contained 25contigs in 25scaffolds. The 454 Titanium standard data were assembled with Newbler, version 2.3. The Newbler consensus sequences were computationally shredded into 2 kb overlapping fake reads (shreds). Illumina sequencing data wereassembled with VELVET, version 0.7.63 [17], and the consensus sequences were computationally shredded into 1.5 kb overlapping fake reads (shreds). We integrated the 454 Newbler consensus shreds, the Illumina VELVET consensus shreds and using parallel phrap, version SPS - 4.24 (High Performance Software, LLC). The software Consed [18], [19], [20] was used in the following finishing process. Illumina data was used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using the software Polisher developed at JGI (Alla Lapidus, unpublished). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected using gapResolution (Cliff Han, unpublished), Dupfinisher [21], or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning. Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and by Bubble PCR (J-F Cheng, unpublished) primer walks. A total of 79additional reactions and 10shatter libraries were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. The total size of the genome is 4 168 266 bp and the final assembly is based on 137 Mb of 454 draft data which provides an average 33.4\u00d7 coverage of the genome and 544 Mb of Illumina draft data which provides an average 133\u00d7 coverage of the genome.

At Camp Detrick, BG was used as a non-pathogenic surrogate in process development for spore-forming bacteria It is tempting to speculate that the University of Wisconsin supplied BG to Porton Down: A note found in the archive of Dr. Baldwin's papers, dated February 19, 1943, contained an order from Dr. Fildes (presumably Sir Paul Fildes, a noted bacteriologist active in the British BW program at the time), for a batch of B. subtilis spores. It is not clear whether BG or B. subtilis subsp. subtilis was supplied, or whether this material was actually delivered. Unfortunately, original records describing in detail the maintenance of the strains during the period 1942\u20131955 were destroyed as per US Army policy at the time (Dr. Mark Wolcott, USAMRIID; personal communication), and the personnel who had first-hand knowledge of the strain passage histories and methods are deceased. Therefore, the actual source of the Camp Detrick isolates must be inferred from published work [6], limited available documentation (e.g. ATCC 9372) and the genome sequences presented hereFrom Camp Detrick the isolates were eventually transferred to ATCC as B. subtilis var. niger \u201cred strain.\u201d The desire to maintain a phenotypically and genotypically uniform simulant throughout the biodefense communityprompted us to elucidate whether significant phenotypic and/or genomic differences had accumulated in any of the commonly used isolates during the growth and transfer of strains to different institutions and to compare the isolates in broad use today to the so-called \u201cMil-Spec\u201d strain (ATCC 9372).In contrast, the origin of ATCC 49822 prior to acquisition F. Young's laboratory (the depositor) is unclear.",

Multiple morphotypes were noted for ATCC9372, ATCC 49822, Detrick, and 1013, while the archival 1942 isolate, the isolate obtained from Dugway Proving Ground (Dugway) and BACI051 appeared to be pure populations on LB. All strains tested positive for BGusing Real Time-PCR primers specific to the recF gene (Methods S1) [27]. The appearance of multiple colony morphotypes even within single \u201cstrains\u201d strongly suggested an as-yet undescribed level of genetic diversity within these samples that likely affected the expression of cell-surface components and/or sporulation. The intra-strain colony morphology variation was particularly dramatic in the in vitro passaged 1013 and ATCC9372 isolates, in which one variant of each lineage had lost the production of color on LB orSBAplates (Figure 2), suggesting more dramatic alterations to the genome.",

Primary amino acid sequences of RAST-annotated proteins are on average 72% (median 83%) identical between B. atrophaeus and B. subtilis.

The nature and annotation of the mutations are found in Table 4 and can be assigned an approximate temporal order in which they occurred (Figure 5B). Based on this analysis, 1942 is the most likely parental strain for all of the isolates in this study, with the 1013 lineage diverging earliest, followed by 49822, then the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage prior to the transfer to Camp Detrick. This conclusion is based on the observation that 49822 shares three SNPs with Detrick-1. The latter is the most likely progenitor of the other \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates, since it has the fewest mutations relative to strain 1942. Detrick-1 can be differentiated from other \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates by possessing the parental allele of spo0F rather than the H101R allele (position 3231470) that is characteristic of all of the other \u201cmilitary\u201d BGisolatesand the ATCC9372 strains.

            "text": "The 72 kb deletion in 1013-2 included the structural genes for biosynthesis of surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide with a mild hemolytic activity [34]. To test whether the \u201cmilitary\u201d and in vitro passaged strains possessed low-grade hemolytic activity, we streaked these variants on rich agar media containing 5% sheep's blood and looked for hemolysis. To our surprise, all strains exhibited striking variation in their coloration (Figure 2A), with the 1942, 9372-1 and Detrick-1 isolates considerably darker on blood agar than the other \u201cmilitary\u201d and in vitro passaged isolates. In addition, on LB the 1013-2 and 9372-1 isolates appeared white and off-white, respectively. Pigmentation of B. subtilis colonies is associated with production of a melanin-like pigment by the CotA protein, a major component of the spore coat [37]. In addition to the variations in pigmentation, streaks of the 1942 and Detrick-1 isolates were consistently translucent under transillumination (Figure 2B). These zones of translucency are suggestive of weak \u03b2-hemolysis, which has previously been observed in B. subtilis strains that produce high levels of surfactin [34], [35], [38]. The other strains exhibited either weak \u03b1-hemolysis or none at all, with the exception of the strongly hemolytic 49822-1 variant. At least in the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage, the quasi-hemolytic phenotype and dark-brown colony pigmentation correlated with the presence of a wild-type spo0F allele, suggesting that the ability of B. atrophaeus to lyse red blood cells may be regulated in part by spo0F. However this was not universally the case; the BACI051 strain had two discernible variants on SBA (not shown), one of which appeared to have recovered partial hemolytic activity (Figure 2B).",

The growth of the 1942 strain was used as a reference for determining relative growth rates of the other strains. The results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 6 and Table S4. In general, growth of the 1013 isolates was significantly diminished relative to the 1942 in many different growth conditions, most notably in the ability to use amino acids and peptides as carbon and nitrogen sources, to withstand osmotic stress, and to grow under reduced pH. In addition, the strains had developed sensitivity to beta-lactams, quinolones, and membrane-disrupting activities. These results suggested broad combined effects of several mutations on the phenotype of the strains. In addition to the spo0F(A98P) allele, which is a likely candidate for highly pleiotropic effects on the decision to sporulate under many different conditions, both strains contain substitutions in the yetF and yqgE genes that may be contributing to the phenotypes observed. The more pronounced defect in 1013-2 may be attributable to defects in the gerAB and gerAC genes and the large 72 kb deletion which contains several genes involved in germination.",

Only one mutation differentiates that isolate from the Detrick-2 isolate \u2013 a 2-bp insertion in the yojO gene encoding a putative activator of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Again, the physiological role of this mutation is unclear, although nitric oxide synthesis plays a critical role in modulating antibiotic resistance in Bacillus spp. [39]. In addition to its role in promoting resistance to antibacterial drugs, NO is known to modulate B. subtilis genes involved in nitrate respiration when oxygen is limited [40]; thus the lowered growth in this strain may reflect the inability to grow to higher densities and overcome the resulting lower oxygen tension. An additional isolate, BACI051 is clearly derived from Dugway, yet two variants have accumulated additional mutations in sigH (spo0H), hpr/scoC, and ebrB.

Recently, more sensitive phylogenetic approaches using AFLP have delineated B. atrophaeus as a separate species [13], [14].

            "text": "The selection of a strain with the desired properties appears to have occurred in at least two discrete steps, as shown by the genome sequences and metabolic profiles. The initial step appears to have been the adaptation of a strain to growth in corn steep liquor, an acidic medium rich in protein and lactate [44]. The robust growth of the Detrick strains relative to 1942 in low-pH medium containing high lactate levels is likely due to mutations in mmgD (2-methylcitrate synthase, position 2029530), or a short-chain 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (position 3437350), or both. The most likely candidate for a mutation in the Detrick isolates that increases growth is the frameshift in mmgDthat occurred following the divergence from the 49822 lineage and results in an altered C-terminus (Figure S1). The mmgD geneencodes a 2-methylcitrate synthase that is expressed in the mother cell at the intermediate stages of sporulation [45]. A null mutation in mmgD had no perceptible effect on sporulation, although other TCA-cycle enzymes when mutated led to a loss of sporulation [45]. The effects of the frameshift mutation on sporulation and cellular physiology on the function of the enzyme are not clear at this time. We speculate that the frameshift mutation alters the substrate specificity of MmgD in favor of citrate, thus increasing the flux of lactate-derived intermediates through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Evidence for this possibility includes the observations that 2-methylcitrate synthases can have partial citrate synthase activity [45] and that the B. subtilis mmgD gene can complement a gltA (citrate synthase) mutant of E. coli\n[46]. Alternatively, alteration of function of mmgD may have predisposed the lactate-adapted strain to acquisition of a hypersporulating phenotype, which is not readily isolated or stable in B. subtilis (see below); however the presence of a hypersporulating phenotype in an independently evolved lineage (1013) of BG indicates that the species may have an intrinsic predisposition to evolving such a phenotype in vitro.",

Importantly, the selection of a strain optimized for spore yield resulted in the fixation of a new spo0F allele that has no counterpart among the available spo0F sequences (Figure 8). The sole Spo0Fsequence that differs at position 101 is that of B. clausii, in which tyrosine replaces histidine. Notably, the spo0F(H101R) mutation is distinct from a separate spo0F(A98P) mutation present in the in vitro passaged 1013 isolates. Given that the amino acid sequence of B. atrophaeus Spo0F is identical to that of B. subtilis but for two conservative substitutions, it is likely to have very similar if not identical biochemical properties. Detrick-1 and 1942 likely represent one of the two R colony morphotypes described by Hayward et al.\n[6], whereas the hypersporulating F morphotypes likely arose due to the emergence of the spo0F(H101R) mutation. However, the possibility that Detrick-1 represents a reversion mutant at this locus from Detrick-2 cannot formally be excluded, but since it represented the dominant morphotype in the 1952 Detrick vial we believe this is unlikely. The presence of the spo0F(H101R) allele in the ATCC 9372 strains suggests that these strains were acquired by ATCC after this mutation appeared within the Detrick lineage. Experiments to verify the roles of each allele in modulating sporulation are currently in progress. Preliminary results indicate that transformation of B. subtilis \u0394spo0F with B. atrophaeus DNA and selection of spo+ cells dramatically alters colony morphology independently of the spo0F allele introduced; additional studies to verify the effects of each allele are currently in progress (James Hoch, personal communication).",

H101 has been proposed as a potential metal-binding site with particular affinity for Cu2+\n[49]. Binding of Cu2+ (or another divalent metal) at this site may modulate interaction with one or more sensor kinases that promote sporulation. Substitution of positively charged arginine at this position could potentially mimic the binding of a metal cation in the loop containing H101, resulting in altered sporulation of the strains due to a change in the interaction with the kinases governing sporulation. It is unclear why, given the proposed role of divalent Cu2+ in suppressing sporulation, H101R would result in a hypersporulation phenotype. The mechanistic relationship between spo0F(H101R) and the hypersporulation phenotype will be tested in future experiments.",

Although the presence of several other mutations within this lineage confounds the attribution of the hypersporulating phenotype to this allele at this time, the presence of a mutation in the same gene as another hypersporulating mutant is highly suggestive. The effect of proline substitution at position 98 on Spo0F functionis not immediately obvious, but the relatively inflexible proline residue can disrupt alpha-helices in protein structures. The 1013-1 lineage exhibits a hypersporulating phenotype even more pronounced than spo0F(H101R) strains in the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage.

            "text": "The selection pressures acting on the sporulation pathwayare highlighted by the sheer number of mutations discovered within the entire data set that occur in proteins known to play roles in sporulation. Nine of the 38 mutations (23%) found in all lineages were in genes that directly or indirectly regulate either entry into stationary phase or sporulation; this number exceeds the number that would be expected if mutations were to occur by chance, since less than 5% of B. subtilis genes are dedicated to regulatory processes of any kind [50], [51]. In addition to the mutations found within the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage, the two variants of ATCC 49822 shown in Figure 2 differ by mutations in rpoB (Table S5) which also plays a role in entry into sporulation [52]. Null mutations in spo0F resulting in asporogenous phenotypes contribute to colony morphology variation in B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis\n[53], [54], [55]. Enhanced in vitro \u201cfitness\u201d is also a likely driver behind the recovery of asporogenic B. anthracis mutants that were discovered during the investigation into the B. anthracis attacks of 2001 [56]. Because the process of sporulation is highly energy-intensive and irreversible once commenced, mutants that delay sporulation (or fail to sporulate altogether) to take advantage of remaining nutrients would out-compete wild-type cells during repeated passage in vitro in the absence of other selection pressures, as has been demonstrated in extended in vitro evolution studies with B. subtilis under relaxed sporulation conditions [57]. This may not be universally the case, since gain-of-function mutations in sporulation such as those observed in this studymay compete favorably with wild-type cells if cannibalism of vegetative cells by sporulating bacteria is the dominant selective pressure [58]. Finally, horizontally transferred genetic elements can have dramatic effects on sporulation: for example, recent studies of phage lysogeny in B. anthracis have revealed the ability of several integrated phages to positively affect the kinetics of sporulation upon lysogeny of commonly used B. anthracis strains [59].",

            "text": "Available evidence suggests that hypersporulation is not easily evolved in vitro. Maughan and coworkers attempted to evolve populations of a laboratory strain of B. subtilis with a hypersporulating phenotype by repeatedly heat-shocking cultures. While their efforts to enrich for hypersporulators failed, other studies revealed that asporogenous mutants evolved readily [60], [61], confirming many early studies ([62] and references therein). With the exception of the studies by Maughan et al., most ofthese investigators applied selections intended to inhibit sporulation rather than to enrich for strains with elevated sporulation rates. The 1013 lineage was never heat-shocked during its many transfers; thus the adaptations seen in this work are the result of balancing sporulation versus vegetative growth for prolonged periods on agar slants. However, because undomesticated isolates were observed to sporulate to 98\u2013100% [60], we cannot formally exclude the possibility that in vitro culture of the 1942 strain following its isolation for an unknown period by the University of Wisconsin might have selected for a hyposporulating variant. In this scenario, the H101Rand A98P mutations would represent suppressor mutations. We consider this possibility unlikely, given the phenotypic similarity of two environmental isolates in the UW collection (1942 and NRS-356). Furthermore, a progression toward darker pigmentation and greater hemolysisis evident in the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage (Figure 2B). These phenotypic changes are associated with the accumulation of additional mutations including a P145L substitution mutation in sigH, a positive regulator of sporulation [63], [64] and an A13P mutation in scoC, a negative regulator of sporulation [65]. Together, the strains analyzed in this study suggest strong selective pressures on the genes in the sporulation pathway, and more carefully controlled studies should be carried out to determine the dynamics of in vitro evolution and adaptation of spore-forming organisms, as has been done extensively in E. coli\n[66], [67], [68], [69], [70].",

This activity was present in a separate lineage of in vitro passaged organisms, so it is not immediately clear why \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates, i.e. those subjected to selection within the early days of the development of BG as a simulant organism, would have lost the catalase activity characteristic of the parental isolate. Because the KatA gene product is not found in spores [41], [71], we consider it unlikely that the absence of this activity would impact the resistance of spores to decontamination reagents, and thus any antioxidant resistance phenotype exhibited by spores of \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates would likely have gone unnoticed. However, direct comparisons of the \u201cmilitary\u201d B. atrophaeus lineages to the progenitor strains have not been done, and pleiotropic effects of a spo0F mutation on spore physiology cannot currently be excluded.",

The SNPs and indels identified in the analysis of evidentiary materials currently become the basis for higher-throughput assays to screen large numbers of samples [56], [72]. Decreasing costs of whole-genome sequencing, and the comprehensive nature of the analysis, may make this the preferred method of forensic analysis of microbial samples in the future. With recently developed techniques of allele quantitation within populations by mass spectrometry [73], real-time PCR [74], and census-by-sequencing [68], [75], it may be possible to quantitate accurately rare alleles within any given microbial population. We are particularly intrigued by the possibility that, given a mixture of different variants and sufficient sequencing power, ultra-high coverage sequencing may prove to be a more quantitative means of enumerating the relative populations in a sample even before the presence of variants has been established. The results from sequencing two strains of BACI051 in this study provide evidence of such hidden diversity.",

These have revealed significant divergence of putatively identical strains from one laboratory to another, largely arising from mutations that accumulate during serial passage. Like the earlier work, our study highlights the utility of approaches based on whole-genome sequencing for the discrimination of closely related strains, especially when investigating the provenance for a given isolate. Tragically, at least 13 institutions are known to have destroyed archival collections of Select Agents [82] following the implementation of mandatory monitoring and reporting requirements, representing an incalculable loss of phenotypic and genomic diversity.
