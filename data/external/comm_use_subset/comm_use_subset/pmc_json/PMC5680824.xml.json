As a result, systematic investigation of the association between host genetic factors and the occurrence of influenza is of pivotal importance. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified as priority the studies which considered the role of host genetic factors on susceptibility to severe flu [17].",

Everitt et al. and Zhang et al. demonstrated increased morbidity and mortality in rs12252-C homozygotes during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. Due to the high frequency of the rs12252-C allele in Asians, the effect of the homozygosity for this allele was proposed to translate to a population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe flu in the Chinese population compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Both studies were performed with small sample sizes of H1N1-infected patients, calling for further studies on large sample sizes. Two studies reported a strong association between IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C and worse clinical outcomes in patients infected with 2009 IAV pandemic. The studies, however, doubt the presence of such association, at least among Europeans, as several rs-12,252-C homozygous patients only developed a mild flu [9, 31].",

Using this tool, allele frequency and genotype distribution were calculated for cases and controls, as well. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (version 11). Continuous and categorical data were described in the usual fashion; means \u00b1 SDs were used to describe continuous variables, and numbers (percentages) were used to describe categorical variables. Association between categorical variables, including study group (mild flu vs. flu-negatives), rs12252 genotype (CC, CT, TT, and C carriers), rs12252 allele (C and T), province (Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan), diabetes (positive vs. negative), and hypercholesterolemia (positive vs. negative), was assessed using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test. For each cell with zero counts in contingency tables, Yates\u2019s correction was used. Also, where more than 20% of cells had counts less than 5, the alternative Fisher\u2019s exact test was used instead of Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test. Univariable logistic regression was used to test the association of each independent variable with mild flu. Variables with a P value smaller than 0.2 in the univariable model were included into the multivariable logistic regression. Also, a backward method using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) was used to make the model as simple as possible. As we sampled cases and controls from three distinct provinces of Iran, we retained the variable \u201cprovince\u201d in the final model. This was to ensure that residual population admixture, due to differences in participants\u2019 area of residence, does not confound the association between rs12252 genotypes and mild flu. All statistical tests were two-tailed with a type I error of 0.05. Observed powers of the estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were also calculated to assess the robustness of our results (Additional file 1).",

For example, Zhang, et al. pointed to the significant role of IFITM3 genetic variants on the epidemiology of influenza among Chinese individuals [31]. Yang, et al. found a significant association between IFITM3-SNP rs12252 and susceptibility to severe, but not mild flu, among Asian and Caucasian ethnicities [29]. Conversely, Mills, et al. found evidence of an association between rs12252 C allele homozygotes and susceptibility to mild flu in patients with Caucasian ancestry, attending primary care, but could not confirm the association between this SNP and susceptibility to severe flu [22]. Studies conducted by L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez and Giao, et al. did not find evidence for the association between rs12252 C allele homozygotes and susceptibility to sever flu [11, 19, 22].",

The inconsistent results reported by studies investigated the association between IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and influenza, made Yang, et al. to conduct a systematic review. Their meta-analysis included 445 patients with influenza and 4180 controls from four studies, including different ethnic and severity subgroups. Their results showed that patients with the rs12252-C/C genotype were more likely to increase the susceptibility to severe but not in mild flu, in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese [29].",

This may be explained as due to the differences in participants\u2019 ethnic background, since we studied Iranian ethnicities while Yang, et al. focused on UK Caucasians and Han Chinese ethnicities. Although, the rs12252-C allele in the Iranian population was rare, the overall effect of this allele on the risk of influenza was found to be considerably high. As our sample size was small, the power for some of our estimates was not desirable. In case such findings being replicated by future studies, the knowledge can be used in effective management of the epidemics. For example, understanding the biological pathways leading to mild and severe flu may lead to improvement of therapeutic options, and can alter existing vaccination practices. Findings of large-scale studies on genetic susceptibility to influenza would also guide population-based prevention efforts. For example, by considering the genetic susceptibility of different sub-populations to influenza virus in a country, human and medical resources would be allocated to high risk areas in case epidemics/pandemics occur.",

Little is known about the frequency of this genotype in Iran. In our study, the C allele frequency observed among flu-negative individuals was 2.40%, resembling the allele frequency among Englanders.

Although all participants were of Iranian ethnicity, participants of each province might be different regarding their genetic and social history, leading to residual confounding due to population stratification. Population stratification is related to situations when cases and controls are of different ethnic backgrounds with different genetic compositions, and has been noted as the most important type of the bias in genetic association studies. To control for the effect of residual population admixture on our results, we adjusted genetic association between IFITM3-SNP rs12252 and susceptibility to mild flu for participants\u2019 residence area. Growing empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that statistical adjustment for confounding effect of ethnicity provides estimates of genetic associations which are robust to bias from population stratification [4].",
