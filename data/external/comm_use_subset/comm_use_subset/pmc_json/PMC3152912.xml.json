While many of the immunomodulators expressed at the maternal-fetal interface are products of decidual leukocytes such as T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages [2,5,7], leukocytes are not exclusive producers of these molecules. Trophoblasts, including both cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, are fetal-derived cells of epithelial origin that form the placental chorionic villi. These cells contact and attach to the maternal endometrium and serve as a barrier between maternal and fetal blood supplies in human pregnancy [8]. Trophoblasts are a source of many cytokines and other immunomodulatory molecules that support both placental development and parturition [9-11].",

The role that HIV-infected trophoblasts play in vertical transmission and pregnancy outcome is incompletely understood. In in vitro experiments using trophoblastic cell lines, cells were efficiently infected with cell associated virus [13], but not cell free virus [14] due to differences in entry pathways into the cell. In the latter case, virus production was marginally increased by treatment with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. HIV infections can dysregulate cytokine expression in trophoblasts [15,16]. It has been speculated that aberrant expression of cytokines results in placental inflammation, facilitating transfer of the virus across inflamed membranes to infect the fetus [16].",

Placental and fetal infection occurred in nearly all pregnancies in FIV-infected queens [17,18]. We recently reported that FIV-infection during early-and late-term gestation affects immunomodulator expression, producing a pro-inflammatory microenvironment at early, but not late pregnancy [19]. However, the specific cell populations expressing the targeted immunomodulators were not identified. In the present study, we hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of immunomodulator expression in trophoblasts and contribute to reproductive failure. Our objectives were to determine whether feline trophoblasts microdissected from early-and late-term placentas of infected queens were infected with FIV, to quantify trophoblast expression of representative pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and other immunomodulators known to be important in pregnancy, and to assess whether gene expression was related to pregnancy outcome.",

As previously reported [17,18], cats were reproductively mature, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animals of less than 12 months of age when obtained from a commercial cattery. Ten cats were inoculated intravenously with 1 ml of a feline plasma pool containing approximately 1.3 \u00d7 104 copies/ml of FIV-B-2542 (provided by Dr. Edward Hoover) [20]. Ten cats were uninoculated and served as normal controls. Infection was confirmed within 6 weeks p.i. by detection of FIV provirus by PCR and for seroconversion using the PetChek\u00ae FIV Antibody Test Kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME), then queens were allowed to breed naturally with SPF toms. Toms used to breed uninfected females were never exposed to infected females and vice versa. Breeding was observed and pregnancy was confirmed by palpation and ultrasonography.",

Immunomodulators produced by trophoblasts play important roles in the progression of pregnancy. Thus, understanding how infections or perturbed pregnancy correspond to altered gene expression specifically in trophoblasts, in situ and in vitro, has been the focus of many investigations [29-32]. We were able to detect expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in feline placental trophoblasts at both time points during feline gestation. The relative expression of all immunomodulators increased in normal specimens as gestation progressed, indicating increased immunomodulatory function of feline trophoblasts at late pregnancy. At early gestation, FIV infection was associated with slightly decreased expression of all cytokines, although only the expression of IL-5 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) decreased to significant levels. At late gestation one anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4) and one pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-12p35) were decreased in FIV-infected queens. The data suggest that FIV infection of the queens caused a minor effect on trophoblast function, and an FIV-induced pro-inflammatory effect in trophoblasts was not clearly evident.",

One would predict reduced placental function in dying pregnancies. However, decreased gene expression was not significant for all immunomodulators, suggesting that reduction in immunomodulator function was not solely attributable to deterioriation of the placenta in non-viable pregnancies. The decreased expression of IL-4 and IL-6 in early placental trophoblasts from non-viable pregnancies parallels the IL-4 and IL-6 expression patterns found in the endometrial tissue and deciduas of women with frequent implantation failures[33] and recurrent abortions [34]. IL-4 is a Th2 cytokine that is mainly involved in the peri-implantation period of placental development [35]. Along with transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), IL-4 mediates the process of trophoblast invasion during human placentation [36-39]. IL-4 and IL-6 contribute to the angiogenesis of trophoblastic villi [40]. Silencing of IL-6 in JEG-3 cells (choriocarcinoma cells maintaining trophoblast-like characteristics) using siRNA resulted in significantly reduced proliferation of those cells [41]. IL-1\u03b2 activates matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP-3), a protease that digests extracellular matrix proteins and allows trophoblast penetration of the maternal endometrium [42]. In the present study, the decrease in expression of IL-1\u03b2 approached significance (p = 0.052) at early pregnancy. In the human placenta, CXCR4, expressed by trophoblasts, is also important in trophoblast invasion via interaction with its ligand, SDF-1\u03b1, expressed on decidual stromal cells [43]. In addition, this interaction protects trophoblasts from apoptosis via stimulation of anti-apoptotic pathways [44]. IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of 35 and 40 kd protein subunits, is also an important regulator of trophoblast invasion. It inhibits trophoblast invasion by causing an IFN-\u03b3-dependent reduction in expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and other proteases that digest extracellular matrix proteins. IL-12 also causes an increase in expression of inhibitors of these proteases [45]. The decreased expression of IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p35, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-term non-viable pregnancies shows dysregulation of putative mediators of feline trophoblast invasion during early feline gestation, an outcome that could result in nutrient and oxygen deprivation of the developing fetus and account for the increased reproductive failure that occurred in infected animals.",

Correspondingly, FIV was detectable at a low level (Ct > 37) in only one trophoblast specimen, a placenta from a late-term fetal resorption, indicating that trophoblasts may not be highly susceptible or permissive to FIV infection. This result was surprising, given the high frequency of fetal infection that was documented in these same cats [17,18], and suggests that infected trophoblasts may not be the source of fetal infection. We speculate that immune cells in the surrounding microenvironment, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) or Th17 cells, the former of which are known to support the replication of FIV [47,48], may influence trophoblast function and serve as the source of fetal infection. Our laboratory is currently investigating feline Tregs and Th17 cells in lentivirus-induced placental immunopathology and pregnancy failure.",

LCM is a procedure which is laborious, time-intensive, and expensive to perform, so limiting the samples collected was a necessity. We attempted to minimize inter-cat variability by evaluating multiple placentas from the same queen where possible. The differences that we have historically observed between placentas from the same queen assured us that we can consider placentas from the same queens as independent specimens [17,19,27]. Yet, the inclusion of additional placental specimens may have strengthened the statistical power and allowed us to identify additional viral effects. In addition, it is impossible to eliminate all cell contamination from the microenvironment surrounding the trophoblasts due to limitations in the precision of focusing the laser. However, our samples were highly enriched for trophoblasts, as is evident by the well-defined tissue lifts that we were able to achieve (Figure 1). LCM followed by qPCR has been used as a means to collect trophoblasts from whole placental specimens and measure gene expression in these cells by others [49]. Regardless of the limitations, this study provides novel information. Our previous reports clearly reveal that FIV infection results in significantly higher rates of reproductive failure, probably by inducing placental immunopathology [17-19]. The present data shed additional light on this anomaly, suggesting that aberrant expression of trophoblast cytokines that may regulate trophoblast invasion accompanies fetal demise.",

A virus-induced, pro-inflammatory environment was not detected in trophoblasts. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species, a finding which may explain the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected cats. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare. This result suggests that reproductive failure and altered trophoblast gene expression in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral infection of trophoblasts, but perhaps was influenced by cells in the microenvironment adjacent to trophoblasts. The effects of placental immune cells on trophoblast function and pregnancy maintenance in the FIV-infected cat requires additional study.",
