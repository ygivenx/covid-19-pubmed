Characterizing the oncogenic potential of viral pathogens has important consequences for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malignant neoplasms [4], [5]. Tumor viruses in particular have received renewed attention in the context of recent global efforts to characterize the etiology of cancer [6], [7].

The disease is associated with an exceptionally low median age of presentation of  months [13] and is often diagnosed in utero. Metastatic neuroblastoma has two biologically divergent subtypes. Stage 4S is characterized by an age of presentation between in utero and  months, metastases confined to liver, skin, lymph nodes and bone marrow, and its ability to regress spontaneously [14], [15]. In contrast, stage 4 tumors are presented at any age, demonstrate high infiltration rates in bone marrow and bone, and are most often progressive [10], [16]. While genes related to neuronal differentiation have been described to be upregulated in stage 4S in comparison to stage 4 neuroblastoma, thereby indicating distinct levels of neuronal differentiation [17], little is currently known about the differences between molecular etiologies of stage 4 and stage 4S neuroblastoma.",

Interestingly, the early onset of the disease overlaps with periods of high susceptibility to viral infections and is reminiscent of acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u2013 another pediatric tumor with uncertain etiology for which an infective cofactor has long been suspected [18]. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have associated reduced neuroblastoma risk with immunologic indicators such as previous childhood infections, day care attendance, and breast feeding [19], [20] that are suggestive of an infective cofactor [21]. While transforming polyomaviruses such as JCV and BKV were previously identified within neuroblastoma samples and other pediatric embryonal tumors [22]\u2013[24], newer studies seem to render these associations inconclusive [25]. Therefore, the role of pathogenic cofactors of neuroblastoma oncogenesis remains unresolved.",

Unfortunately, viruses are of polyphyletic origin and thus lack common universal marker genes as they are frequently exploited in metagenomics studies targeting cellular microorganisms. Consequently, it is not currently possible to specifically PCR-amplify viral nucleotide sequences within a given tissue without prior information about the infective agent being sought [26]. As a result, several systematic assays for pathogen detection have been developed that do not rely on targeted PCR-amplification of viral factors [27] and were employed to identify Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) as a human tumor virus [28]. These systematic approaches were recently supplemented by sensitive deep sequencing technologies [27]. These technologies were recently applied to exclude several cancer-virus associations based on negative evidence [29], [30] and aided in the identification of MCPyV, a human polyomavirus, as a cofactor of Merkel cell carcinoma [31].",

In particular, our method maps sequence reads to a combined reference database comprising the human genome and all known viral reference sequences. The approach is configured to allow for high mismatch rates and mappings to multiple reference sequences (\u2018multimaps\u2019). By using this combined and sensitive mapping strategy, our approach is especially well suited for detecting human-viral chimeric transcripts and viruses diverging from known references. In contrast to existing subtractive approaches for viral transcript discovery, our method abstains from discarding reads homologous to the human genome from further analysis. Instead, Virana exploits multimaps to assign sequence reads to a homologous context comprising human reference transcripts and viral reference genomes. These homologous regions retain the full, unfiltered information contained in the raw sequence data while also being amenable to further analyses by multiple sequence alignments, human-viral phylogenies, and orthogonal taxonomic annotations, thus greatly aiding in the interpretation of the results.",

First, the read mapper employed in our study is able to partially align reads that contain a human-viral chimeric breakpoint to multiple reference sequences. Consequently, these partially aligned reads can be detected by Virana within the generic analysis of homologous regions (see below). The second, more sensitive approach to detecting chimeric transcripts is based on paired-end read information. Since the STAR mapper assigns reads to a combined reference database comprising both human and viral reference sequences, ends of paired-end reads whose inserts span the breakpoint of a chimeric transcript will be aligned to different reference sequences. These discordant read pairs are reported by STAR during read mapping (see above) and can further be filtered by mismatch score or sequence complexity in order to yield a high-confidence list of chimeric transcripts.",

The background set is used to construct four additional validation data sets spiked with viral reads at increasing rates of sequence divergence (0%, 5%, 10%, 25%, see Materials and Methods). Performance is quantified in terms of sensitivity and specificity (see Materials and Methods). Applying all three viral detection methods on the validation data sets reveals comparatively high rates of correctly detected viral reads for CaPSID and RINS at low sequence divergences between 0% and 5%. Specifically, the two subtractive methods achieve  fold higher sensitivities compared to Virana (sensitivities of  versus  for subtractive approaches and Virana, respectively, see Figure 2). In contrast, Virana substantially surpasses subtractive approaches at higher rates of viral sequence divergence (10\u201325%), offering comparatively stable sensitivities between -fold and -fold higher than Capsid and RINS, respectively (sensitivities of  versus  for subtractive approaches and Virana, respectively, see Figure 2, left panel). Notably, while subtractive approaches fail to identify 20\u201390% of viruses in settings of high sequence divergence, Virana is the only approach able to reliably detect the full set of viruses in all validation scenarios (see Figure 2, right panel). As a result of Virana's ability to detect human-viral transcript homologs, reads originating from several human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) that are part of the human reference genome but technically also belong to the viral family Retroviridae are detected in validation data at all levels of sequence divergence. Since the detected HERV reads originate from the human rather than from the viral part of the validation data, these reads classified as false positive (FP) hits for the purpose of this validation. As a result of this artifact, Virana exhibits a slightly lowered specificity compared to subtractive approaches (0.99985 versus 1.0 for Virana and CaPSID/RINS, respectively). However, we note that HERV reads are correctly classified by Virana during homologous region construction and by optional BLAST-based taxonomic annotation. These reads can therefore be safely and automatically ignored in subsequent analyses if HERV expression is of no interest to the researcher.",

Three such human-viral homologs are used in the analysis: V-ABL of the acutely transforming retrovirus A-MuLV, Bo17 of herpesvirus BoHV-4 (a model virus for oncogenic gammaherpesviruses such as EBV and KSHV and implied in several animal cancers [69]) and gag of HERV-K(HML2)22I, a class of human endogenous retroviruses associated with some forms of breast cancer [70]).

Subsequent analysis of discordantly mapped read pairs by Virana (see Materials and Methods) correctly identified the TP53 gene as fusion partner of both V-ABL and Bo17, indicating that detection of human-viral chimeras is reliable even at low twofold coverage.

Based on these estimates and given an average sequencing depth as employed in the NB1 analysis panel, Virana requires a minimum twofold sequence coverage of an average viral cDNA transcript in order to detect the transcript within a homologous region with % probability (Figure 5, upper left quadrant, dashed blue vertical line). This sequence coverage is produced with % probability if at least one viral transcript is present per cell, on average (Figure 6, upper left quadrant, dashed blue vertical line). The number of viral transcripts per cell required for detection is inversely related to transcript length and sequencing depth, in principle: at a transcript length corresponding to a small viral genome ( bp) and a per-sample sequencing depth of % of the sequencing depth generated in the NB1 panel, a transcript coverage of  and at least  viral transcripts per cell are required for reliable detection (Figure 6, upper right panel, dotted black vertical line).",

In this study we selected CaPSID and RINS due to their high performance and public availability and compared their detection performance with that of our novel method Virana. Both CaPSID and RINS follow a subtractive approach, e.g. they separately map input data to viral and human reference sequences and subtract viral read mappings that are similar to the human genome from the analysis. While CaPSID is conceptualised as a generalised framework that supports the subtraction process by means of a database and a web server, RINS features an integrated pipeline that splits input reads into shorter fragments in order to increase mapping sensitivity, followed by transcriptome assembly of putative viral reads into full length transcripts.",

Such homologous transcripts may display human-viral sequence similarities of 86% (Bovine Herpes virus) and up to 92% (acutely transforming retroviruses). Subtractive approaches silently discard these transcript from the analysis due to their similarity to the human reference genome. In contrast, our novel method Virana follows a radically different approach. Instead of separate mapping to viral and human reference database followed by digital subtraction, Virana undertakes a particularly sensitive read mapping to a combined set of human and viral references. By allowing for multimaps, this mapping strategy facilitates discovery of viral transcripts regardless of their similarity to human factors. Apart from being conceptually simpler by relying on only one mapping step and discarding the subtraction procedure that is both possibly erroneous and computationally costly, this approach empowers the mapper to make informed decisions about relative alignment quality by weighing different human and viral reference positions against each other. As a direct consequence of this increased mapping quality, paired-end reads can be mapped across human and viral references, allowing for detection of human-viral chimeric transcription and proviral integration events.",

As a consequence, this validation favors subtractive approaches by reducing the danger of erroneous subtraction of viral reads that are similar to the human genome. In addition, the sequence divergence validation contained reads sampled at high coverage. However, transcripts of tumor viruses are often expressed at only low cellular abundances and are thus expected to have low sequence coverage. We therefore next validated the ability of viral detection approaches to detect viral transcripts homologous to human factors at varying levels of sequence coverage. Virana, by virtue of not relying on digital subtraction, demonstrated superior sensitivity at this validation both in settings of natural sequence homology as well as in cases of human-viral chimeric transcription. Specifically, Virana was the only method able to detect evidence for all viruses even at low twofold coverages. We observed that both RINS and CaPSID discarded a substantial amount of human-viral homologous transcripts due to their high similarity to the human reference genome, a fact that explains the lower performance of these methods in this validation scenario.",
