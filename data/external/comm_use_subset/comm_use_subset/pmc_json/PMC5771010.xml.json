The majority of plant viruses are transmitted by insects of hemipteran families, such as aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, planthoppers, and thrips [2]. As a consequence, vector control is currently the only practical and effective strategy for disease prevention. Over the past few decades, a number of research have investigated the interactions between plant viruses and insect vectors because of its importance in viral epidemiology and disease management [2\u20134]. A detailed understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of insect-virus interaction will lead the discovery of novel and specific molecular targets for whitefly and whitefly-transmitted virus control.",

            "text": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) (Geminiviridae; Begomovirus) causes one of the most devastating emerging diseases of tomato worldwide [5]. TYLCV is transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a circulative persistent manner [2, 6]. B. tabaci is a cryptic species complex composed of at least 36 species [7]. In this species complex, the Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (Herein called MEAM1) species is highly invasive and a superior, co-adapted vector for begomoviruses. The epidemics of begomoviruses are usually associated with outbreaks of MEAM1 and the relationships between begomoviruses and whiteflies are complex [8]. When the MEAM1 viruliferous whiteflies were transferred onto non-host plants of the virus, the longevity and fecundity of the viruliferous whiteflies decreased [9]. This indicates that begomoviruses, in some cases, are insect pathogens. The transcriptional response of MEAM1 whiteflies to Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) demonstrated that TYLCCNV can activate whiteflies\u2019 immune response [10]. Further results showed that whiteflies use a variety of defense mechanisms to combat virus infection, such as autophagy and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [11, 12].",

            "text": "Circulative plant viruses move through the insect vector, from the gut lumen into the haemolymph or other tissues and finally into the salivary glands from where viruses are disseminated to new host plants during insect feeding [13]. In this process, midgut and salivary glands are the two major barriers that viruses have to overcome before successfully transmitted [2]. In fact, the gut barrier is the principal determinant for the ability of an insect species to transmit a virus. For instance, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum is a non-vector of TYLCV, because the viruses can\u2019t cross midgut into haemolymph [14]. Persistent viruses, whether propagative or nonpropagative, can be transmitted to plants after injection into the insect hemolymph [15]. In many cases, injected viruses are transmitted at higher rates than orally acquired viruses [16, 17]. Microscopic studies have shown that TYLCV virions is extensively localized in the filter chamber and cross the epithelial cells in the midgut [6, 18]. Compared to the whole body of whiteflies, TYLCV has a longer retention and higher quantity in the midgut [19]. Nevertheless, TYLCV infection can activate the autophagy pathway in whitefly midguts, which inhibits the efficiency of virus transmission [11]. These studies show that midguts are major reservoir where virions accumulate during acquisition and are critical in insect-virus interaction. However, due to the small size of whitefly midgut, the transcriptional responses of whitefly gut to virus infection remains unknown.",

Six genes were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in guts samples (Fig. 5). Moreover, the fold changes obtained by the DEG were generally more extreme than those obtained by qRT-PCR. The inconsistency may be partially due to the lower sensitivity of qRT-PCR compared tosignificant DEG. In addition, the fold changes in guts were more significant than those in whole body. These results indicate that the transcriptome profiles of whitefly guts in response to TYLCV infection are a little different from the whitefly whole body. Nevertheless, qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the direction of change detected by DEG analysis, suggesting that DEG results are reliable.",

Cargo receptor can selectively bind to an extracellular substance and deliver it into cell via endocytosis [21]. For example, cargo receptor ERGRC-53 is required for cellular glycoprotein trafficking of arenavirus, hantavirus, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, and filovirus [22]. In human, the scavenger receptor class B type I and scavenger receptor B2 have been reported to be a receptor for the hepatitis C virus and enterovirus 71 separately [23, 24]. ABC transporters are members of a transport system superfamily and involved in diverse cellular processes such as maintenance of osmotic homeostasis, nutrient uptake, resistance to xenotoxins, antigen processing, bacterial immunity and pathogenesis [25]. Interestingly, one ABC superfamily transporter, multidrug resistance protein1 (MRP1), which is well-known to confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells through enhanced drug efflux [26], was also found in our DEGs. (c18467_g1: multidrug resistance-associated protein 1-like [Diaphorina citri], log2 ratio = 1.87) In addition, the downregulation of MRP2, which shows structural similarity to MRP1, suppresses the transport of various genotoxic substances in the liver during hepatitis virus infection [27]. As we know, virus receptors play essential roles in the early steps of viral infection. These regulated receptors and transporters might help TYLCV cross the whitefly epithelial cells.",

In addition, cell cycle checkpoints govern cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage and incomplete DNA replication [34]. The upregulated genes in cell cycle checkpoints suggest that TYLCV infection may induce DNA damage and affect cell cycle in whitefly gut cells. Interestingly, we also noted that all of the 10 upregulated genes encoding ubiquitin regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, 5 of these genes accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. G2/M phase-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (G2E3) as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein was implicated in the DNA damages response and cell cycle regulation [35], and then attenuated replicative stress [36]. Previous study also showed that Beet severe curly top virus (BSCYV) can induce RKP (a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase), which is able to interact with cell cycle inhibitor ICK/KRP proteins to regulate the cell cycle [37].",

This result suggested that encapsulation might be activated after TYLCV infection. The altered genes encoding surface receptor were classified into three major classes; a) CD36 family (n = 4), b) epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like (n = 3), and c) Toll receptor (n = 2). CD36 family is class B scavenger receptor that participates in apoptotic cell removal in Drosophila embryos and in phagocytosis of S. aureus [41]. Interestingly, scavenger receptor has been noticed in GO enrichment analysis, but just 1 out of 4 of these CD36 genes was categorized into scavenger receptor activity. The EGF, a transmembrane protein, mediates phagocytosis, has been demonstrated with knockdown experiments, in a broad range of bacteria in Drosophila [42]. Spaetzle (markedly upregulated) is the ligand for Toll receptor, leading to Toll signally pathway controlling the potent resistances to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections [43]. Toll is one of the major signal transduction pathways (another one is Imd), used by antimicrobial responses in Drosophila [44].",

Ras is a key regulator of cell growth in all eukaryotic cells and positioned centrally in signal transduction pathways that respond to diverse extracellular stimuli [45]. The medfly homologues of Ras proteins have been shown to affect phagocytosis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and E. coli [46]. PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in apoptosis and autophagy in Drosophila [47, 48], as well as in medfly apoptosis [49]. Decreases in phagocytosis produced by pathway inhibitor indicated that PI3-kinase was required for internalization of bacteria [50]. Several studies have implicated involvement of MAPKs in insect innate immune responses [51, 52], and the activation of MAPK pathway contributes to efficient infection by baculoviruses [53]. Otherwise, several studies have documented that PKC plays an important role in regulating the receptor-mediated endocytosis of virus-receptors complexes [54\u201356], and specific inhibitor for PKC is highly effective in blocking West Nile virus (WNV) entry into mosquito cell line (C6/36) [57]. Here we found that all genes involved in the MAPK pathway and PKC were upregulated in DEGs.",
