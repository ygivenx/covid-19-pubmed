Patients who have already progressed to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation have a mortality rate of nearly > 50% and need to be considered separately [1]. This population was beyond the scope of our study. Additionally, we aimed to determine the incidence of complications of BAL and identify factors associated with either higher diagnostic yields or lower complication rates. Exploratory aims include characterization of commonly isolated pathogens, the rate of post-procedure treatment modification as an indicator of clinical utility, as well as post-procedure 30 and 90-day mortality. Post-procedure treatment modification reflects the true value of the procedure since some microbiological findings may be of non-pathogenic commensals while other results may not be amendable to clinical intervention. Identification of such data will optimize patient selection, allowing endoscopists to counsel patients and recommend alternative diagnostic modalities for those with low likelihood of successful diagnosis or at high risk of complications.",

In addition, our study found no impact of prior anti-microbial therapy or duration of antibiotics on diagnostic yield. The mismatch between positive yield and post-BAL result treatment modification may be attributable to the fact that 40.5% (64/158) of pathogens detected were respiratory viruses for which therapeutic options were limited. In addition, in none of the 16 isolates of cytomegalovirus was there inclusion bodies detected in the corresponding cytology. This raises doubts over the pathogenic nature of the cytomegalovirus isolates. Cases where the BAL cytomegalovirus isolate was the only finding (including no antigenemia) were not labelled as positive diagnostic yield.

However, the fact that the data was extracted from a prospective bronchoscopy database directly populated by endoscopists\u2019 reports ensured completeness of data. In addition, procedure details were collected in a standardized format. Sample size may also have lacked statistical power to detect factors associated with complications because of the low complication rate. Finally, this data was limited to a single institution study. However, this meant that BAL sampling and microscopic testing was performed in a standardized manner.",

A diagnosis is possible in 60.8% and the complications are largely self-limiting. However, the diagnostic yield varies with underlying cause of immunosuppression and alternative sampling should be considered early in patients with hematologic malignancies because of poor results with BAL. This group with haematologic malignancy has a high 90-day mortality and delayed diagnosis risk clinical deterioration. Tuberculosis appears to be an important pathogen in endemic regions especially in the non-HIV, non-hematologic malignancy group. Aspergillus was the other commonly identified pathogen via culture and Galactomannan assay. Viruses accounted for 40.5% of positive diagnosis and this finding often leads to limited modification in clinical management. Our data show both the utility and limitations of BAL in the approach to immunocompromised patients presenting with lung infiltrates. This data will serve as the foundation on which newer therapeutic strategies such as transbronchial cryobiopsy can be evaluated.",
