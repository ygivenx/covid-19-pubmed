However, interpretation of results is not always straightforward. The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR is negatively impacted, by compounds present in the clinical sample that may partially or completely inhibit the RT and/or PCR chemistries [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Potential inhibitors that might be incompletely removed from stool suspensions during RNA extraction include hemoglobin, immunoglobulins, bilirubin, triglycerides, complex polysaccharides, organic and phenolic compounds, glycogen, fats, and metabolic products especially those from pathological conditions, bacteria, vegetables, medications, anticoagulants, and drugs or alcohol [4], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Adding to the list of endogenous rRT-PCR inhibitors are exogenous inhibitors from extraction protocols such as detergents, chelating compounds and guanidinium HCl [9].",

A sufficient number of samples with high, intermediate, and low levels of inhibitors were chosen for re-analysis to enable comparison between extraction procedures at each of these levels of inhibition. The results of MS2 inhibition for each sample by extraction protocol is shown in Fig. 1 and summarized by levels of inhibition in Table 1, Experiment 2.

However, low pathogen copy number, inefficient extraction and the incomplete removal of inhibitors, reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the molecular assays. Among clinical samples, stool suspensions contain a wide range of materials that have the potential to inhibit RT and/or PCR chemistries [4], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Thus, it is important to develop a reliable method to determine whether inhibitors are present in nucleic acid prepared directly from stool suspensions. An appropriate internal control does not exist because of wide differences in eukaryotic and prokaryotic composition in fecal material between patients.",

These four commercial extraction methods are among the most commonly used in the diagnostic laboratories. None of samples 1 to 93 contained MS2 RNA. Similarly Nonove et al (14) did not report any unusual amounts of MS2 RNA that would have indicated prior presence of MS2 in their samples when they added MS2 to 106 stool suspensions at concentrations two to eight-fold less than used in this study. MS2 coliphage was thus used as a non-competitive external control because of its absence from human clinical samples. MS2 is a better external control for rRT-PCR than plasmid or phage DNA since it also measures the efficiency of the RT reaction [5], [12], [13], [14], [17], [18]. Here, the MS2 was added to the lysis buffers to minimize sample manipulation and increase the uniformity between manual and semi-automatic extraction protocols. The presence of rRT-PCR inhibitors was evaluated by extracting equal volumes of stool suspension and eluting with equal volumes of elution buffer. Extractions were performed in parallel to eliminate storage related differences, and RNA was assayed on the same rRT-PCR run to minimize analytical differences [19]. Absence of MS2 in the stool samples 1\u201393 was confirmed by MS2 rRT-PCR of RNA extracted with the EasyMag RNA extraction system using lysis buffer without exogenous MS2. This extraction protocol, the system that had the least amount of samples with inhibitors, was chosen to increase the chance of finding any endogenous MS2 RNA in the stools.",

Stool samples extracted by the KingFisher and the NucliSENS easyMag had fewer extracts with inhibitors than the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor.

It is important to note that all four extraction protocols yielded equivalent amounts of enterovirus RNA from enterovirus added to suspensions where there was no inhibition of MS2 RNA rRT-PCR in the samples for equal starting and elution volumes. The pattern and amount of enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition was similar for specific suspensions regardless of whether enterovirus was added before extraction or viral RNA added to the reaction mix after extraction.

All four extraction methods were suitable provided that an external control was used to identify problematic samples. rRT-PCR of MS2 RNA recovered from MS2 coliphage added to the lysis buffers of RNA extraction systems is a good predictor of inhibition of enteroviral RNA extracted from stool suspensions. More than one inhibitor may be present in the stool suspensions or added during extraction and their efficiency of removal differs between the extraction protocols. The correlation between the extent of MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition and enteroviral rRT-PCR inhibition increases inversely in relation to the amount of enteroviral RNA in the sample. In agreement with Dreier et al [5], MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition should be tested for each RNA sample from a stool suspensions each time it is tested since there is no way to predict in advance whether inhibitors have been efficiently removed during extraction or remain active after cycles of frozen storage. Viral rRT-PCR results should not be considered as quantitative results when MS2 rRT-PCR is inhibited by more than 3 Ct. Finally, we recommend that any negative viral rRT-PCR result from a sample with an inhibition of >6 Ct for MS2 rRT-PCR should be considered invalid and alternative methods used to re-assay or re-extract the sample. If the RNA is diluted and re-tested only samples with positive results for enterovirus rRT-PCR should be considered as valid.",
