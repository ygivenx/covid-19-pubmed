            "text": "Apart from the direct effect of the virus infection, the inefficient immune response may also be caused by an unbalanced neuro-endocrino-immunological (NEI) status after PRRSV infection. In this case, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is considered to play a crucial role as it changes the host\u2019s susceptibility to some infectious diseases. Under stressful conditions, such as during a robust proinflammatory response in the early stage of virus infection, the HPA axis may be triggered by high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 [9]. It has been found that the plasma levels of these cytokines increased after HP-PRRSV infection [10], which may possibly activate the HPA axis after infection. Following the activation of the whole HPA neuroendocrine-pathway, glucocorticoids (GCs) secreted by the adrenal glands are the final effector molecules that suppress violent inflammations and balance the immune response [11]. The anti-inflammatory effects of GCs are mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [9, 12], which is a member of the steroid hormone-receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors (NR3C1). Accordingly, pharmacologic GCs such as dexamethasone (DEX) have been used as potential therapeutic options for virus-induced autoimmune disease and inflammations, including the Kilham rat virus (KRV) and severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) [13, 14]. However, the administration of excess DEX may impede the secretions of ACTH and cortisol through negative feedback loops of the HPA axis, which may also lead to other problems [15]. Hence, DEX treatment has multiple effects on the immune response in the clinical setting. In some other cases, excess GCs induce the apoptosis of lymphocyte cells, which are responsible for immune suppression during viral infection. Apharmacy GC inhibitor, mifepristone (RU486), has been used for GR blockade, and the treatment is termed as a temporary adrenalectomy. However, reports on the interactions between HP-PRRSV infection and HPA axis regulation are currently rare.",

            "text": "Our previous studies showed that HP-PRRSV infection consistently induced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of infected piglets, which resulted in long-lasting high body temperatures and considerably higher mortality as compared to that induced by classical PRRSV infection. Interestingly, most of the infected piglets displayed severe thymus atrophy and lymphocyte apoptosis from 3 to 10 days after the virus infection [7, 10, 16\u201318]. These symptoms may develop under NEI deficient conditions, which suggests that some neuro-endocrine hormones released by the HPA axis failed to modulate the anti-viral innate immune response during the viral infection [19\u201321]. Thus, we hypothesized that the HPA axis was affected by the HP-PRRSV infection, which then failed to sustain homeostasis in the infected piglets. In this study, we investigated the functions of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets by assessing the effects of daily treatment with 1 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) RU486 or 2 mg/kg b. w. DEX. At 10 days post infection, higher mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs were observed in pharmacy-treated animals, which indicate that disorders of the HPA axis enhance the disease status of piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain. Furthermore, significant changes in the proinflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood were observed in both DEX- and RU486-treated piglets, which was consistent with our hypothesis of incomplete HPA axis function. These results provide new insights into the NEI pathophysiology associated with HP-PRRSV infection.",

However, after viral infection, for example PCV2, even such low dose of DEX treatment may accelerate the presence of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [25]. Similar to the case of PCV2, our results showed that daily treatment of DEX also suppresses the cell-mediated immunity of piglets after HP-PRRSV infection (Fig. 3). RU486 are generally characterized as progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, and because of this activity, high dose (more than 100 mg) treatment of RU486 are commonly used as a contraceptive [26]. RU486 rarely has detrimental effects on the immune response of animals. However in our case, when the piglets were pre-infected by HP-PRRSV, the additionally treatment of RU486 significantly accelerates the development and severity of the disease. As indicated in the survival rates analysis, piglets in Group B died very early after the infection (Fig. 1b). Given the evidence of much higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and sever lung lesions, the lethal outcome may due to the multisystemic wasting syndrome induced by severe inflammations. The uncontrolled inflammations may be related to insufficient HPA regulation that induced by RU486 treatment.",

The HPA axis is generally activated as the first line of defense against viral infection in humans [29]. GCs secreted by the adrenal glands after HPA axis activation have been found to suppress immune functions through negative feedback control of the immune system [30, 31]. Predisposition to inflammatory or autoimmune disease can cause insufficient GCs responses; however, chronic stress, predisposition to infectious diseases and other sequelae of immunosuppression can induce excessive GCs production [11, 32]. Although many types of immune-mediated diseases lead to the dysregulation of the HPA axis and impropriate GC production, GC analogues, such as DEX, have long been used as effective anti-viral agents in both humans and animals [33].",

Surprisingly, neither RU486 nor DEX improved the health status of virus-infected piglets, but instead, enhanced the disease. After evaluating the proinflammatory cytokine levels in infected piglets, we found that RU486 exerted a negative effect on the host anti-inflammatory response during HP-PRRSV infection by suppressing the physiological concentrations of GCs, which play a vital role in the anti-viral process. In contrast, DEX inhibited the inflammation induced by HP-PRRSV, although the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood were significantly decreased and long-lasting high fever and lung lesions were also observed in these HuN4-infected piglets. Despite the solvent of RU486 contained 50% ethanol (30 mg/ml), the dose used for each piglet was no more than 0.1 g/kg b.w., which has been demonstrated to have neither significant effect on the plasma cortisol levels nor anti-viral cell-mediate immune response, as well as no perceptible depression of the central nervous system [22, 25]. Thus, we believe that DEX induces immunosuppression during HP-PRRSV infection, allowing enhanced viral replication and leading to high mortality. These results demonstrate that both RU486 and DEX influence the anti-inflammatory responses in HP-PRRSV -infected piglets, leading to more severe disease.",
