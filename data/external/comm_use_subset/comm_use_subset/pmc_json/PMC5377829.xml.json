In general, RADT sensitivity is strongly dependent on high viral load of respiratory specimens and therefore performs best in young infants with classical symptoms of RSV bronchiolitis. A pooled RADT sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76% to 83%) was reported for pediatric patients (4). In our screening population of children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with any symptom of respiratory tract infection, we observed RADT sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 55% to 72%) compared to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (5), while in adults, sensitivities of different RADT were <25% (6). As an alternative to RADT, rapid nucleic acid amplification assays have been developed to facilitate early recognition of RSV infection. These assays provide high sensitivities but require a testing time of at least 1 h (7, 8).",

The platform technology was previously developed for the detection of influenza virus (Alere i influenza) and provides test results in less than 15 min. The test is optimized for point-of-care settings and does not require specific training or experience in laboratory techniques. A number of studies have evaluated this rapid influenza test in comparison to both viral culture and RT-PCR, reporting sensitivities between 45 and 100% (9\u201315). Recently, the platform has been extended with test cartridges for the detection of streptococcus A (Alere i Strep A) and RSV (Alere i RSV). Both assays are being introduced into routine clinical care. No data have been published regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the novel Alere i RSV test. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of the Alere i RSV test for rapid detection of RSV in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection.",

Samples with invalid test results due to any kind of Alere i RSV test handling failure were excluded from the analysis. In contrast, samples with an invalid test result due to sample interference were considered false negative if the RT-PCR result was positive and as false positive if the RT-PCR reference was negative. Possible reasons for invalid test results include inhibition of the amplification reaction or delayed amplification in samples with low viral load. Notably, the manufacturer recommends retesting of samples with invalid Alere i RSV results. However, as the volume of the respiratory samples used in our study was limited to 400 \u03bcl, we were unable to follow this recommendation.",
