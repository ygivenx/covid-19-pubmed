It was estimated in 2008 that the lifetime direct medical cost of chlamydia had reached US$516.7 million (excluding indirect costs such as loss of productivity and other intangible costs) [3]. Up to 80% of women with genital chlamydia is asymptomatic, but itself can be both highly contagious and dangerous in terms of long-term health consequences such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy [4, 5] as well as increased risks of HIV infection [6]. All these complications can be avoided with early diagnosis and treatment.",

Incidence caused by genital Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) has increased by nearly 40% from 37.20 per 100,000 persons in 2010 and 51.3 per 100,000 in 2014 in the neighbouring Guangdong Province [26, 27].",

Secondly, compared to the Youth Sexuality Study (2011) in Hong Kong where 19.7% of male and 5.2% of female youth (18\u201327 years old) reported eposex partners in the past six months [34], the proportions of male and female aged 18\u201326 years old with \u2265wisex partners in the past 12 months were 2.6% (95% CI 0.9\u20137.2%) and 3.3% (95% CI 1.1\u20139.7%) in TeSSHS respectively. Thirdly, the consistent condom use reported in the general population is 24% (95% CI 21.84\u201326.16%) [35] whilst the consistent condom use among TESSHS participants is 35.9%, indicating that they may be more health conscious and prepared to practise sexual risk reduction.",

All of them reported only one sex partner in the previous 12 months. These older women were mostly married and whose partners reportedly travelled out of Hong Kong within the past 12 months. TeSSHS also identifies partners travelling out of Hong Kong as a risk factor among the sexually experienced females, which is similar to that of the China CT study [16]. According to the data from SHC, the pattern of clinically CT cases shows two similar peaks for males, one at age 20\u201329 years and the other at age \u226540 years, whereas for females only the 20\u201329 years old peak is observed [39]. The mismatch of the SHC data and TeSSHS could be that the older females are normally reluctant to come forth for Chlamydia trachomatis testing as they may not be aware of their risks [4].",

According to a study with cross-border Hong Kong-based Chinese male truck drivers in Hong Kong, CT prevalence is as high as 8.5% [40]. Another study among female sex workers in Hong Kong finds CT prevalence at 4.6% using CT DNA testing [41], which is higher than the estimation in the sexually experience but lower than that of the sexually active young women in our study. Nevertheless, a more recent CT prevalence estimation among the female sex workers in Hong Kong estimates the genital CT prevalence at 10.6% [28]. Over the Hong Kong-China border in Shenzhen, the combined prevalence of genital CT is reported to be as high as 17.7% in a sample of 2534 patients from 34 hospitals [42].",

A systematic review concludes that when prevalence of CT is between 3.1\u201310.0%, it can be cost-effective [43]. Based on the findings of TeSSHS, Chlamydia trachomatis screening for sexually active youth between 18\u201326 years of age and older women (40\u201349 years) could be cost-effective. Other risks factors such as living status and travel history could help identify people of higher risks. Certain key populations have expressed concern and the need of CT screening, for example, in the CT prevalence study among the cross-border truck drivers, a third of those who phoned for the results expressed this need [40]. The female CT positive participants indicate testing preference of public facilities, which could be related to costing issue, or their trust in public health system in Hong Kong. The public facilities could be ideal sites for health promotion, education and screening for chlamydia.",
