The presentation of ACS associates fever and respiratory symptoms (including cough, dyspnea/acute respiratory failure, and chest pain) to new pulmonary infiltrates. The pathophysiology of ACS is only partly understood and combines the following mechanisms: respiratory infections,1 pulmonary artery thrombosis,2 hypoventilation associated with intense chest wall pain, and pulmonary fat embolism in a context of osseous vasoocclusive crisis3\u20135 and environmental insults.6 Lung computed tomography (CT) scan studies recently depicted the following patterns as typical for ACS7: complete consolidation of dorsal regions (lower lobes), contrasting with normal aeration of ventral ones (upper lobes). The previous finding that bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of ACS patients showed lung neutrophilic infiltration suggests that these consolidated lung regions would be fraught with intense regional inflammation.4,8 However, the topographic distribution of lung inflammation during ACS and whether regions with increased lung density would exhibit more lung inflammation than normally aerated regions has never been studied.",

Four of them had a previous history of ACS, 2 of them were following a chronic transfusion program and 1 of them received hydroxyurea. These patients had been fasted and glucose or insulin-containing infusions had been discontinued for at least 6 hours. Reasons for PET/CT were as follows: osteomyelitis (n = 2), suspicion or follow-up of extrathoracic malignancy (n = 6), and endocarditis (n = 2). 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax and SUVmean) was measured in normally aerated lung regions of each side and in the liver. Three of these SCD patients had osseous vasoocclusive crises within 3 months of the PET/CT scans but none developed ACS.",

The parametric distribution of data was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test. Physiological and outcome variables were compared between patients with higher and those with lower lung SUVmax, using the median lung SUVmax as cutoff value (\u22642.5 or >2.5) because no previous value of lung SUV was reported during ACS and because SUVmax is the most widely used parameter for quantifying 18F-FDG uptake in the clinical setting.16,19,23 The relationship between regional lung 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax) and lung density (HUs) was assessed using both linear and nonlinear regression models, and coefficients of determination (R2) were compared to identify the model that fitted best the data. PET-acquired data were also compared using 2-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests were performed when overall P value was <0.05. Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered significant.",

This hypothesis is consistent with our finding of increased white blood cell counts in patients with lung SUVmax >2.5, as compared with others. Nevertheless, the contribution of other inflammatory cells such as alveolar macrophages, monocytes, or lymphocytes to lung 18F-FDG uptake cannot be ruled out, as previously suggested by neutrophil depletion experiments12 and further illustrated by microautoradiographic studies in other settings.30 For instance, the role of endothelial cells, known to be highly metabolically active and to take up 18F-FDG after nitric oxide stimulation,31,32 a key mediator in the pathophysiology of sickle cell vasoocclusion phenomena,33 would need to be explored in further studies in order to better understand the mechanisms of lung 18F-FDG uptake during ACS.23\u201325",

Consolidated lung bases exhibited dramatically higher metabolism than normally aerated apices. The mechanisms accounting for the predominant location of consolidated regions in lung bases during ACS have been previously discussed,7 and may include the effect of gravity, amplified by increased lung weight related to permeability-type lung edema and subsequent pressure gradient along the ventrodorsal axis; the diaphragmatic cranial displacement, due to increased abdominal pressure; and the superimposed pressure of heart weight on lung tissue. In our series, increased lung densities mainly resulted from regional lung consolidation probably associated with alveolar inflammation and infiltration by plasma-like edema fluid, as suggested by higher 18F-FDG uptake. Such heterogeneity in lung 18F-FDG uptake, following a ventrodorsal gradient with higher cellular metabolic activation in lung bases than in apices, has been previously reported in experimental,27,28,34 as well as in clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome,15 and was mainly attributed to mechanical forces associated with ventilator-induced lung injury. In the current series, including no mechanically ventilated patients, the higher 18F-FDG uptake in lung bases could, at least partially, be perfusion-related, lung bases exhibiting more regional perfusion than apices.35 The effect of lung regional perfusion distribution on 18F-FDG uptake is debated24,27,34; yet, a positive relationship between perfusion and 18F-FDG uptake was demonstrated in an experimental model of acute lung injury and endotoxemia,27 likely related not only to increased regional load of inflammatory cells and mediators in regions receiving more perfusion, but also to higher endotoxin delivery in these regions leading to more regional inflammation. During ACS, lung injury is theoretically driven by a vascular insult, and a positive relationship between regional perfusion and 18F-FDG uptake would be expected.",

As compared to lung density changes detected by conventional x-ray imaging, 18F-FDG uptake may serve as an early marker of lung inflammation during acute lung injury. In line with these findings, in the current study, normally aerated apical lung regions of ACS patients showed higher 18F-FDG uptake than those of SCD non-ACS controls, suggesting that normally aerated regions might also be affected by early inflammatory phenomena, which are detectable only with 18F-FDG PET. As control patients were selected among a cohort of SCD patients followed-up in our institution, increased 18F-FDG uptake in these normally aerated regions cannot be ascribed to changes in pulmonary metabolism related to sickle cell anemia itself, but would rather be related to manifestations of ACS leading to hypermetabolism in the tomodensitometrically healthy lung, possibly involving vasoocclusion phenomena in the pulmonary microvasculature or pulmonary blood flow redistribution toward the upper lobe resulting from hypoxic vasoconstriction in consolidated lower lobes. Nevertheless, the pathophysiologic significance of the increased 18F-FDG uptake in normally aerated regions during ACS remains unclear and needs further studies.",

This is consistent with the review of CT scans by a radiologist blinded to the interpretation of 18F-FDG PET scans who confirmed that atelectasis was present in a minority of segments (Table 1), and thus that changes in regional 18F-FDG uptake would not be a direct consequence of loss of aeration.",

In fact, our patients were very homogeneous in terms of presentation and outcomes; none died nor required invasive mechanical ventilation, thereby limiting the ability to show differences between groups of patients exhibiting different degrees of lung metabolism. Intriguingly, patients with SUVmax >2.5 exhibited significantly lower Paco2 upon admission than others, reminiscent of a previous series in which ACS patients having acute pulmonary hypertension and poorer outcome were less hypercapnic.18 Some patients with severe ACS exhibit hypercapnia, probably reflecting hypoventilation related to chest pain and/or opioids. Conversely, normocapnia during ACS may be associated with more extensive lung parenchyma involvement and higher severity of disease, as reflected by pulmonary hypertension and lung inflammation. Patients with SUVmax >2.5 also had longer ICU stay than others, consistent with a more severe disease, with more intense pain and longer delay in hypoxia resolution. The predictive value of 18F-FDG PET during ACS, and the clinical relevance of the findings from this imaging tool in this setting, would need to be confirmed in a larger series of patients including more severe ACS.",

Indeed, the most severe patients (ie, those requiring mechanical ventilation) were excluded from this study because transport to the PET/CT facility was considered hazardous. Second, 18F-FDG uptake was quantified using SUV, a static index that does not allow for studying 18F-FDG kinetics parameters, only available with dynamic indexes.13 Still, using a static index allows for reducing the time of acquisition, thereby limiting the time spent by patients out of the ICU, and acquiring images over many bed positions in order to scan the entire lungs. Third, using SUV did not allow for correcting 18F-FDG uptake for regional lung density, as previously performed with dynamic indexes.12,13,15,27,36 Fourth, as discussed earlier, the mechanisms involved in the higher metabolism observed in upper lung regions of ACS patients as compared to SCD non-ACS controls are unclear. Obtaining an additional control group including ICU patients with SCD but no ACS might have allowed discriminating whether such higher lung metabolism is related to the ACS process itself or to systemic manifestations associated with severe SCD.",
