While much less virulent, the subsequent influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009 [2], [3] are potent reminders of the capacity of the influenza virus to cross the species barrier into humans. Many other pathogens share this capacity: the SARS outbreak of 2003 [4]\u2013[6] has been linked to bats and palm civets [7], [8]. In 2008, a novel arenavirus which killed four out of five patients in South Africa was linked to rodents [9].",

These make the natural, simplifying assumption that the host population is homogeneous, so that changes in infection parameters entirely reflect adaptations in the biology of host infection. In reality, however, factors such as human contact patterns [12] and other host heterogeneity [13], [14] may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events. We concentrate here on the heterogeneity in the spatial structure of the human host population, an area which has hitherto received little attention in the context of adapting pathogens. We model spatially separated communities with varying types and strengths of interconnections, for example between a village and a city. Our aim is to study under what regimes such \u2018ecological\u2019 structure could have a strong effect on emergence, in comparison with \u2018evolutionary\u2019 factors governing the biology of infection.",

We then present new analytical results for the simple models studied previously, which ignored spatial host population structure. We use these expressions to provide useful answers to important questions: if we knew how a zoonotic pathogen would adapt to human physiology, could we anticipate its emergence? How reliable would such predictions be? Furthermore, can we predict which zoonoses will cause outbreaks which do not turn into epidemics? Next, we ask: how large does a single, finite host population have to be, for population size to have a negligible effect? We then incorporate spatial heterogeneity by separating the human host population into communities. We present a model in which a small village is connected, by human travel, with a large city as an example of the general case of two interconnected communities. We use this model to ask: how strong do community interconnections have to be for us to safely ignore the separation of a population into spatially structured communities, such as cities and villages? We review available commuting data to ask how these thresholds compare with typical human mobility patterns? We close with a discussion of implications for public health.",

This threshold ensures a probability of extinction less than \n[16]. Therefore, the number of falsely identified emergences, which would truly be extinctions, is negligibly small.

As an example of the general case of spatially structured communities, we focus on a simple village - city model to approximate the spatial host heterogeneity in rural areas connected, by human mobility, to bigger cities. There are many different types of human mobility between communities such as villages and cities, including short-term commuting and long-term labour migration. Particularly in developing countries, however, information on dominant patterns is sparse. Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence from Vietnam [17], for example, suggests that short term commuting plays an important role: here, a subset of the village residents collects agricultural produce for trading in local markets in the city, and travels to the city on a daily to weekly basis. Accordingly we present a model in which the residence time of villagers in the city is typically less than the infectious period. However, in the supplementary information we also present a model incorporating migration on longer timescales (see Text S1, A.2).

We show that epidemiological parameters such as the outbreak size group according to the evolutionary route.

Our theoretical derivation of the probability of emergence extends this and offers the benefit of being analytically solvable for any possible route of adaptation and any mutation probabilities. We note here that previous work has highlighted the role of other, significant types of heterogeneity in emergence of a novel infection. For example, [29] describe the effect of the pathogens life history, such as the length of infection, on the emergence of a novel pathogen. Further, heterogeneity in human-to-human transmission within a population may have an influence on the course and probability of emergence and outbreaks [13], [14], usually lowering the probability of emergence.
