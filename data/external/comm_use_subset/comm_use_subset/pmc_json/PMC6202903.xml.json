It\nmostly affects children aged from 6 months to 3 years, and its peak incidence age is\n2 years, especially among male infants.\n1\n The most common etiological agents are the parainfluenza virus, influenza,\nmetapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and the respiratory syncytial virus.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n The infection begins at the nasopharynx and spreads along the respiratory\nepithelium, causing inflammation of the subglottic portion of the larynx. Congestion\nand edema of this region lead to a variable degree of airway obstruction,\nrestricting the air flow entry, causing respiratory difficulties.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n In 24 to 48 hours, the situation is aggravated with mild to severe\nobstruction, presence of barking cough, dysphonia, aphonia, or hoarse cry, and\ninspiratory stridor. In extreme cases, besides intensive dyspnea and agitation,\nthere is paleness, cyanosis, numbness, seizures, apnea, and death.\n2\n\n",

Seven days after bronchoscopy, he\ndemonstrated signs of escape through the tracheal cannula, shown by auscultation and\nobserved in the monitor of the ventilation equipment (Servo-i\u00ae, Maquet,\nRastatt, Germany).

There are studies in adults comparing the\nuse of the high-flow nasal cannula versus non-invasive ventilation in tracheal\nextubation, and they show that the high-flow nasal cannula is not inferior to\nnoninvasive ventilation; however, these studies do not specifically address acute\nlaryngitis.\n14\n In the medical literature, we do not know of medical reports regarding the\nuse of high-flow nasal cannula for this purpose.",
