            "text": "\nFlos Lonicera japonica (FLJ) is widely distributed in China and officially listed in the Chinese pharmacopoeia (Xiang and Ning 2008). It was reported to have various biological activities such as antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and widely used in treating exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases and some infectious diseases such as SARS coronavirus and swine H1N1 flu virus (Shang et al. 2011; Wang and Weller 2006). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the major bioactive components of FLJ, and had been reported to have various biological and pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic activities (Wu et al. 2012; Shin et al. 2015). A series of methods had been reported for the extraction bioactive CGA from plant materials. In conventional methods, CGA extraction was mainly achieved by water extraction (WE) (Zheng et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006) or refluent ethanol extraction (REE) (Lan and Zhang 2005). Some disadvantage of these methods were fraction of oxidation, hydrolysis, and ionization due to excessive extraction time and relatively higher temperature (Duarte et al. 2010). Nowadays, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) (Zhang et al. 2008) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) (Hu et al. 2009) had been developed as the feasible extraction methods. Although these two extraction methods greatly lessen the extraction time, it still can\u2019t meet the satisfaction of green chemistry for the consumption of organic solvents (Zhang et al. 2011).",

In order to sieve the better combination of anions and cations, both of them were investigated, respectively. We investigated several common anions on the basis of literature and finally screened out five anions including Br\u2212, Cl\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, BF4\n\u2212, and PF6\n\u2212 (Zhang et al. 2011; Ma et al. 2011; Merlet et al. 2017). As can be seen from Fig. 2(a), four kinds of hydrophilic anions showed better extraction effect, while the extraction yield of hydrophobic PF6\u2212 was relatively poor. In the four hydrophilic anions, the halogen ions exhibit the best extraction yield especially Br\u2212, which may be due to the combination of the halogen ions with the H+ in the cellulose to disintegrate the internal structure of cellulose. This result showed that the extraction rate of CGA depends on the type of anion which has been reported (Liu et al. 2016). Based the same cation of Br\u2212, different groups of cations including [C2mim]+, [C4mim]+, [C6mim]+, [C8mim]+, and [C10mim]+ were examined and the results of the evaluation are shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, the extraction yield of CGA from ethyl to hexyl is obviously increased, it may be because CGA can be better dissolved in the lipophilic IL; the extraction yield of CGA decreased from hexyl to decylate may be due to the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction of ionic liquids affecting the dissolution of CGA.\n",

Under the conditions of 0.5 mg/ml pectinase and 0.25 M [C4mim]Br treatment, pH 3.0, and temperature 40 \u00b0C, the influence of extraction time on yields was studied. The results in Fig. 3a illustrated that when the extraction time increased from 20 to 40 min, the extraction yields increased obviously. And yet the time was changed from 40 min to 4 h, the results remain essentially unchanged. This may be due to the isomerization of the ester groups in the GCA structure and also explained that the long extraction time would make GCA hydrolyzed, which would lead to the decreased GCA extraction yield. It was reported that pectinase can catalyze hydrolysis of ester linkage and using Eucommia ulmoides as the raw material and IL-pectinase as the extraction medium, the extraction rate of CGA was close to 0 under 4 h in 0.25 M [C4mim]Br aqueous solution. We have carried on the experiment to verify, and discovered that long periods of extraction time can cause CGA to be broken down by the HPLC result.\n",
