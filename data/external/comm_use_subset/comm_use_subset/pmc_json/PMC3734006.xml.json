            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family [1]. The infection of TGEV causes severe diarrhea in suckling piglets (about 2 weeks old) and its lethality approaches 100%, which results in enormous economic loss in swine-producing areas in the world [2]. TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense RNA genome of 28.5 kb. About two-thirds of the TGEV genome encodes the replicase proteins (rep) at the 5\u2032 end, and one-third of the genome encodes other viral genes at the 3\u2032 end in an order of 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 [3]. The genome of TGEV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M,), minor envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The surface protein S, a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms peplomers, is responsible for cell receptor binding and membrane fusion [4]. The M protein spans the membrane and interacts with the N protein to form core of the virus during assembly [5,6]. The small E protein, a transmembrane protein detected as a minor structural component, is essential for TGEV replication [7]. The N protein, an internal phosphoprotein [8], interacts with the TGEV genomic RNA to form viral nucleocapsid [5,9], and may disrupt host cell division [10]. To date, there is limited information about host cell responses to TGEV infection.",

The development of proteomic approaches have greatly facilitated detection of proteins induced in virus infected cells. Among those techniques for differentially expressed protein spot analysis, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) is reproducible and sensitive [13]. 2D DIGE has greatly facilitated the comparison of two samples by removing gel-to-gel variability and by using dyes (CyDye) with a greater dynamic range than traditionally used silver or Coomassie stains [14]. Using 2D DIGE method followed by mass spectrometry (MS) identification, comparative proteomics of host cells have been investigated during virus infection, including human influenza A virus [15], human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [16], hepatitis B virus [17], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [18], Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [19], and Dengue virus (DENV) [20], and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) [21]. Proteomics method analyzing host cellular responses to TGEV infection can be used to identify important cellular factors involved in viral pathogenesis.",

TGEV induced significant CPE at 48 h and 72 h p.i., characterized by rounding and detachment of the cells (Figure 1A).

The mRNA level of KRT19, TPMT, LDHB, PP2A, UQCRC1 were increased in TGEV-infected ST cells (Figure 5). The trends of change in the mRNA level of ANXA8, TPMT, LDHB, PP2A, and UQCRC1 were consistent with 2D DIGE results. Interestingly, KRT19 had contrary results to with those of 2D DIGE methods. These data provide transcriptional information complementary to those differentially-expressed proteins detected by 2D DIGE analysis.",

Positive-strand RNA viruses must recruit normal components of host cellular RNA processing or translation machineries for viral RNA synthesis and protein synthesis [34]. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) is an abundant, strictly nuclear phosphoprotein that interacts directly with RNA through a carboxy-terminal RGG sequence [35]. HNRNPU is known to influence pre-mRNA processing, mRNA transportation to cytoplasm, intracellular localization, translation, and turnover of mRNAs [36]. Previous studies have shown that the levels of HIV-1 viral transcripts are dramatically down-regulated in cytoplasm of infected cells by HNRNPU [37]. In this study, the down-regulated HHRNPU was found after TGEV infection, which may facilitate the replication of viruses. Another RNA processing protein, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), was found to be more abundant in TGEV-infected cells. TPMT is a cytoplasmic transmethylase present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which has a molecular mass of 28 kDa and comprises 245 amino acids [38]. TPMT is a drug-metabolizing enzyme widely expressed in mammalian and non-mammalian cells [39]. Previous works have reported that TPMT plays a role in BVDV virus replication and thiopurines inhibit bovine viral diarrhea virus production in a TPMT-dependent manner [40]. Based on these data, an up-regulation of TPMT in TGEV-infected ST cells suggests that this host protein plays an important role in TGEV biology, making it possible target for future drug development.",

In herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected HeLa cells, the synthesis of several ribosomal proteins and their assembly into ribosomes continue in spite of a general inhibition of cellular protein synthesis [43]. Acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) is located in the active part of the ribosome particle, at which mRNAs, tRNAs and translation factors interact during protein synthesis [44]. The cellular RPLP0 was observed as up-regulated after virus infection, such as pseudorabies virus (PrV) infected bovine kidney cells [45], and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected primary B cells [46].

            "text": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that represents a major portion of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in cell extracts [49]. PP2A enzymes have been clearly involved in regulation of cell transcription, cell cycle and viral transformation [50]. Up-regulation of PP2A scaffold subunit A and subsequent dephosphorylation of Tyr-307 in the catalytic subunit was found, suggesting PP2A activation in Huh7 infected cells [51,52]. Activation of serine-threonine PP2A was found in Huh7 cells upon HSV-1 infection, and PP2A activation paralleled dephosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway [53]. In this study, the up-regulation of PP2A was found in TGEV infected ST cells, suggesting PP2A plays an important role in the dephosphorylation of cellular and viral protein during TGEV infection.",

By comparing the finding proteins in this study to previous findings, there is no common gene of target related to coronavirus. The findings in TGEV infected ST cell might not reflect the interaction between the virus and pig intestine epithelial cell. It is surprising that the proteome responses observed did not reveal any immune responses related proteins in TGEV-infected ST cells. It may be related to the host cells chosen or the fact that attenuated TGEV strain was used.

All acquired spectra from samples were processed using TOF/TOF Explore\u2122 Software in a default mode. The data were searched by GPS Explorer (V3.6) with the search engine MASCOT (2.1). The following parameters were used in the search: National Center for Biotechnology information non-redundant (NCBInr) database (release date, July, 2011), Sus scrofa, protein molecular mass ranged from 700 to 3,600 Da, trypsin digest with one missing cleavage, peptide tolerance of 100 ppm,MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da and possible oxidation of methionine. Known contaminant ions (tryptic autodigest peptides) were excluded. A total of 41,373 sequences and 16,019,616 residues in the database were actually searched. All identified proteins had a protein score greater than 59, corresponding to a statistically significant (p < 0.05) confident identification.
