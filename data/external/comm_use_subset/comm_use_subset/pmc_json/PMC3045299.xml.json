The approach does not rely on prior knowledge of the mathematical form of the exposure/disease relationship, an assumption in parametric modeling.

Illustrations were developed to demonstrate how the kernel mapping addresses the nonlinearity without user imposition. Without loss of generality, a low-dimensional problem was used to demonstrate the central themes because the separation boundaries can be observed graphically, which is not the case for higher-dimensional problems. The comparison with LR serves three purposes. First, although LR modeling is widely used for epidemiologic applications, its separation boundary represents a latent characteristic that is often not considered directly. Secondly, the information embedding characteristic of LR is representative of parametric approaches. The possible benefits derived from applying a kernel based technique come with a tradeoff in comparison with parametric modeling of requiring training data for prospective analyses. Thirdly, the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation. Therefore, the SL approach was modified to conform to the LR model interpretation.",

We will refer to the group association as the binary disease status and refer to covariates as risk factors or exposures. Logistic regression has many attractive attributes in this setting. The model coefficients are related to odds ratios (ORs) by exponentiation, which convey relevant exposure/disease association relationships. The LR model is a generalized linear model [3,4]. Various methods have been investigated to generalize such relationships in epidemiologic research. Neural network (NNs) have been used in studies of immunodeficiency viral infection [5] and liver disease [6,7]. Other researchers modified the LR model to include non-parametric functions to study colon cancer [8]. Generalized models have also been used in various capacities to model lung function change [9], blood pressure [10], alcohol consumption [11], and heart disease [12].",

These exposures can be assembled into one vector, x, for each observation, which we label as the input. Hypothetically, there is some relation f(x) that describes the separation boundary between the case and control groups to some specified degree, where the group status is the output. Otherwise, x would not show association with disease. In a multivariate setting, the separation, or decision boundary, is a hyper-surface that reduces to a hyper-plane when x and the disease status bear a linear relation. Error in predicting group status may occur from a number of sources including inferior model specification, complicated relationships between the exposure distributions and group status, random error, non-random measurement error, or some combination of these influences. In practice, decision models rarely, if ever, produce perfect class-separation when making predictions.",

For a linearly separable two-dimensional problem, the input/output separation boundary is a straight line. When this problem is nonlinear separable, the input/output separation boundary is a curve (one dimensional) of some form. In practice, f(x) is rarely known. Interaction terms (or other functional forms) can be introduced within the LR model to capture the attributes of f(x), which are discernable graphically in a two-dimensional problem. However, in higher dimensional problems, it may not be clear whether the modified LR model provides a correct fit of the data. The two-dimensional problem demonstrated herein is used for illustrative purposes though it is representative of higher dimensional problems that are difficult or impossible to observe and model by intuition.",

When model predictive capability is important, Az is often used as the measure of separation in two-class problems [13-15]. In epidemiologic research, ORs are used to gauge the magnitude of association between exposure and outcome. In contrast with the LR model, the SL approach does not produce a data representation that has a useful epidemiologic interpretation. Therefore, we present non-parametric probabilistic methods that can be used for converting SL outputs to more readily interpretable ORs. We also calculated the Az quantity for each model used in the comparison analysis because it is measure of how well the models fit the data. The relationship between ORs and ROC analysis has been previously described [16].",

The SL approach required more involved training with bootstrap re-sampling [28]. Because the sigma-weights impact the performance of the perceptron output, the perceptron training was embedded within the sigma- weight estimation. Perceptron weights were determined by drawing row vectors from the K (training) matrix at random with replacement. The Az was used as a guide for convergence. Because there are only two sigma-weights, a constrained search was used by varying both weights over a range of values. For each sigma-weight combination, the perceptron weights were determined, and the Az value was estimated resulting in an experimental set of values: {\u03c31i, \u03c32i, Azi} for the ith combination. The sigma-weights were determined by the position of the maximum Az value (Azmax): \u03c31 = \u03c31i and \u03c32 = \u03c32i where Azi = Azmax. Once the sigma-weights were established, the perceptron weights were regenerated (fine-tuned) by incrementally increasing the Az convergence criterion using a feedback loop. The perceptron weights that gave the highest Az before non-convergence were used in the validation processing along with {\u03c31, \u03c32}. When using x1 and x2 individually [s1 = 0 or s2 = 0 in Eq. (3)], we retrained the perceptron with the same Az criterion using the respective sigma-weights (determined above). In sum, the sigma-weight pair in combination with the perceptron weights that gave the highest Az for given SL variant were used in the model evaluation comparison.",

For consistency and to avoid user imposition, the same method was used to set the threshold for each model. In two class prediction problems (disease/no disease) used to assign class status, an operating point (decision threshold) must be selected from the model output, often derived from the ROC curve. This operating point represents a tradeoff between making two errors [13,14]. These are 1) the error of classifying cases as controls, defined in summary as the false negative fraction (FN), which is equivalent to 1-sensativty, where the sensitivity is the correctly identified proportion of cases, which is often referred to as the true positive fraction (TP), and 2) the error of classifying controls as cases denoted as the false positive fraction (FP) in summary. Plotting the ordered pairs, (FP, TP), for each threshold, which is a latent variable, approximates the continuous ROC curve. Choosing a threshold fixes the separation boundary. For the LR model, all samples with p(x) scores \u2265 pt were classified as case group members, otherwise they were classified as control group members, where pt is a fixed threshold. To determine the separation boundaries, the operating point for a given model was selected by choosing the sensitivity equivalent to its Az value. Because the FP variable is defined over this range [0-1], the Az value may also be interpreted as the model's mean (average) sensitivity (i.e., the value of the area under the ROC curve is also the mean value of the ROC function).

The coefficients for the standard LR model using x1, and x2 simultaneously without interaction and with x1 \u00d7 x2 interaction were: (\u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b22) = (-7.251, -1.743, 14.33) and (\u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23 ) = (-13.73, 9.66, 26.03, -20.12), respectively. These coefficients are presented as log(ORs) [i.e, ln(OR)] per unit increase in the respective variables. These large values are due to the unit increase because both x1 and x2 span less than one unit. For the standard model, x1 provides a shielding effect with respect to the disease status (e.g., the coefficient remains negative, implying an inverse association of the factor with disease status), whereas x2 shows a relatively stronger positive magnitude of association in comparison with x1. In contrast, in the interaction model, the x1 and x2 terms both show a positive association with the outcome while the interaction term has a negative coefficient. For this initial Az assessment, averages, standard deviations, and SEs derived with bootstrap methods [28] are given in Table 1. The Az quantities for the training x1 and x2 sample distributions were also generated for comparison purposes; these Az quantities were estimated by comparing the respective distributions without model-processing. The sigma-weight pair in combination with the perceptron weights that gave the highest Az were used in the comparison evaluation: (\u03c31, \u03c32 ) = (3.88, 2.47). The trained model Az findings are given in Table 1 for the three SL models.",

This transformation provided the essential link between the SL output and the epidemiologic interpretation for both the multivariate OR relation, which is the combined disease/risk factor association for both (all) the covariates simultaneously including their interactions, as well as the individual risk factor associations. As demonstrated, the ORs exhibit (see figures 6-8) a nonlinear functional dependence with respect to the output score. When the input/output relationship is nonlinear, the LR coefficient does not describe the association properly due to the LR model linear separation boundary.
