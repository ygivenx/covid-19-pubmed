            "text": "To our knowledge, no previous research has attempted bulk prediction of enzymatic mechanism from sequence. However, past research has proved that the Enzyme Commission class of enzymes can be successfully predicted even for distantly related sequences using exclusively InterPro signatures\n[7-9]. Traube et al.[10] used QSAR and enzyme mechanism to predict and design covalent inhibitors for serine and cysteine proteases. Their method, like ours, does not require a solved protein structure, but its mechanism predictions are aimed at drug design and not easily portable to enzymes other than proteases. Choi et al.[11] use sequence to predict the existence and position of probable catalytic sites (grouped and aligned by Enzyme Commission number) with about 25% accuracy (approximately 8% better than random) but their prediction does not specify which mechanism the enzyme might be using in that active site. Other work tried to predict whether an amino acid is catalytic, and could in principle lead towards mechanism identification, but in practice has not been used to infer mechanism, only enzyme reaction. Using 3D structural information, Chea et al.[12] used graph theory to predict whether an amino acid is catalytic, followed by filtering using solvent accessibility and compatibility of residue identity since some amino acids are less likely to be involved in active catalysis. But their output is a binary label (catalytic or not) and not a prediction of mechanism. Using only sequence, Mistry et al.[13] have developed a strict set of rules to transfer experimentally determined active site residues to other Pfam family proteins, achieving a 3% FP rate, 82% specificity and 62% sensitivity. However, again, they do not link the active site residues to the mechanism performed.",

Three of these enzymes, the beta lactamases having UniProt entry name BLAB_SERMA from Serratia marcescens (beta-lactamase IMP-1, UniProt accession P5269), BLA1_STEMA from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (metallo-beta-lactamase L1, P52700) and BLAB_BACFG from Bacteroides fragilis (beta-lactamase type II, P25910) have two MACiE mechanism labels in our dataset, due to the fact that EzCatDb does not distinguish between MACiE mechanisms M0015 and M0258. Both mechanisms are class B beta lactamase reactions, but performed with different catalytic machinery: M0015 uses an Asn residue, while M0258 uses Asp and Tyr. So the need for multi-label prediction is not strong for our dataset, however, multi-label classification is essential for mechanism prediction of real life multi-domain proteins. UniProt Swiss-Prot already contains 12,456 enzymes with more than one Enzyme Commission number. As just one example, the replicase polyprotein 1ab of the bat coronavirus (UniProt name R1AB_BC279 or accession number P0C6V) is cleaved into fifteen different chains, several of which are enzymes with one or more EC numbers, thus totalling nine Enzyme Commission numbers for a single transcript, varying from cysteine endopeptidase to RNA-directed RNA polymerase activities.",

A MACiE mechanism identifier corresponds to a detailed mechanism entry modelled on one PDB\n[18] 3D structure and its associated literature. The entry describes not only the enzyme reaction, but also the catalytic machinery (reactive amino acids, organic and metal cofactors) used to perform the catalysis, down to the role of the individual amino acids, cofactor and molecular intermediates in each reaction step (such as proton or electron donor or acceptor and others) and the chemical mechanism steps (such as bond breaking, bond formation, electron transfer, proton transfer, tautomerisation and others) in temporal order.",

However, in the database EzCatDb, the Paracoccus denitrificans heavy chain (DHMH_PARDE, P29894) is also annotated with MACiE code M0013, possibly because the holoenzyme is a tetramer of two light and two heavy chains (with the light chain hosting the active site). There is little or no similarity between each light and heavy chain (sequence identity < 12%), while the light chains are highly conserved within related organisms (sequence identity > 90%).",

We would like to stress that during this process the original MACiE mechanism annotations remain unchanged. The additional subunit information improves the learning, but, if the user so wishes, can easily be ignored simply by discarding any text beyond the 5th character (thus transforming, for example, M0314_component_I into M0314).",

BRkNN is a multi-label adaptation of the classic k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. The best parametrisation for the data is k = 1, that is, only the closest ring of neighbour instances are used to predict the label of an instance. This suggests a pattern of local similarity among the instances causing efficient but local learning. Our ml2db Java code uses queries to generate a Mulan datafile from MySQL database. A Mulan datafile consists of an XML file for the class labels and a Weka ARFF (Attribute Relation File Format) file for the protein instances and their attributes. Where possible, a sparse ARFF format, parsimonious of disk space and computational power, was used.

In addition, while the equation suggests that proteins having exactly the same signatures can have any level of sequence identity, in practice the sequence identity for couples having the same mechanism never falls below 18% in the data, possibly because two random sequences (of approximately the same length as our sequences) will have a minimum number of identical amino acids by chance alone. The couples having the same mechanism are almost homogeneously scattered above this 18% threshold, but with several couples having about 40% sequence identity and few having very high sequence identity (80% to 100%).

Figure\n2 presents an overview of the performance of different set of attributes in predicting the mechanism dataset. As an indicative baseline for prediction we used the labels predicted when mechanism is assigned simply by the presence of a certain set of InterPro domains (InterProdirect transfer). For example, protein ODPB_GEOSE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, P21874) is part of the dataset and has MACiE mechanism M0106 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and InterPro IPR005475, IPR005476, IPR009014 and IPR015941. Hence, if we use direct transfer of mechanism labels, another protein such as ODBB_HUMAN (2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit beta mitochondrial, P21953) which has exactly the same InterPro signatures will receive a M0106 label, thereby introducing an error, since ODBB_HUMAN\u2019s mechanism is in fact M0280 (or 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase). If several proteins in the training set have exactly the same InterPro attributes, the given test protein will be assigned all of their mechanism labels. The direct transfer method achieves 99.9% accuracy and 95.7% precision on the mechanism set, but only 76.6% recall. That is, when it assigns a label, it tends to be correct, but about a quarter of the proteins do not find another protein with exactly the same InterPro signatures in the training set, and so do not receive a prediction. The low recall is thus mainly caused by false negatives.",

The causes of the misprediction are signatures Anth_synth_I, ADC_synthase, Chorismate-bd_C and Anth_synth_I_N, which protein PABB_ECOLI shares with two anthranilate synthases (TRPE_SERMA and TRPE_SULSO). The two protein families are in fact very similar and the reactions\u2019 Enzyme Commission numbers only differ in the last (substrate) digit: anthranilate synthase has EC 4.1.3.27 and aminodeoxychorismate lyase has EC 4.1.3.38.",
