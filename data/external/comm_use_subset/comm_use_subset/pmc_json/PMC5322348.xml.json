Infection with any one DENV serotype typically produces asymptomatic or mild disease but induces long-term immunity against that serotype (3). However, subsequent exposure to a different serotype may result in more-severe disease characterized by dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome often attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (2, 4). Overall, potential adverse disease outcomes due to immune cross-reactivity complicates efforts to produce effective vaccines against the DENV family (5).",

Reverse genetic systems have also facilitated improved research methodologies with the development of reporter assays as well as the means to produce virus-like particles and live attenuated vaccines (8, 9). In addition, infectious clones provide the opportunity to explore a clonal population of DENV with relatively few mutations versus the \u201cmutant spectrum\u201d typically observed in laboratory passaged stocks (10\u201312).

Flavivirus clones are difficult to maintain in bacteria and often result in sequence rearrangements or mutations that reduce expression of toxic elements from the viral genome. Several approaches have been employed to improve propagation, including use of low-copy-number plasmid (6), insertion into bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes (13\u201315), disruption of promoter regions in viral cDNA (16), as well as microbe-free propagation approaches (17, 18). However, these methods often diminish yields, produce changes in viral sequence, or require significant extraneous effort that reduces the overall utility of the approaches. Importantly, many of these reverse genetic systems report significant attenuation relative to their control wild-type (WT) viruses despite similar consensus sequencing (6). Overall, these results highlight the obstacles for using reverse genetic systems to study DENV disease and pathogenesis.",

Importantly, DENV1 derived from the clone maintained equivalent replication and complete antibody binding fidelity with the wild-type strain. Using the tetrapartite DENV1 molecular clone, we then inserted a known DENV4 envelope protein domain I (EDI) neutralization epitope and demonstrated efficient gain of neutralization function. However, by introducing these changes, we simultaneously ablated two known DENV1 antibody binding sites and disrupted their binding and neutralization. Together, the results illustrate the utility of this newly developed infectious clone as a platform to study DENV immunity by exchanging functional complex epitopes between DENV strains, simultaneously gaining new neutralization properties to other strains while ablating the primary neutralizing antigenic sites of DENV1.",

These overhangs permit directional assembly of the cleaved fragments to generate full-length viral cDNA. With the exception of an ablated restriction site (see Materials and Methods), the sequence directly reconstitutes the wild-type (WT) laboratory strain. The ligated cDNA fragments are then used as a template to produce full-length viral RNA, which is electroporated into C6/36 mosquito cells. To demonstrate transfection efficiencies of full-length transcripts, the results of the infectious center assay indicate low, but stable infection (0.4%) (Fig. 1B).

To determine whether rDENV1ic is attenuated relative to the wild-type virus, growth curves were completed in C6/36 mosquito cells over a 7-day time course (Fig. 1E). The data indicate that wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic replicate equivalently, peaking in focus-forming units 5 days after infection (Fig. 1E). Percent infection of C6/36 cells also demonstrated no significant difference between the wild-type and infectious clone with nearly 100% infection observed 4 days after infection (Fig. 1F). We next examined replication in the human monocyte-derived U937 cell line stably expressing DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), a known DENV attachment factor (Fig. 1G); similar to the C6/36 mosquito cell line, we observed no difference in the replication of the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic in DC-SIGN-expressing U937 (U937+DC-SIGN) cells. These results demonstrate no detectable attenuation of the rDENV1ic clone relative to the wild-type strain in either insect or human cells.",

MAb 1F4, derived from a DENV1-infected patient (20), binds in the envelope domain I (EDI) region and extends into the EDI and domain II (EDII) hinge region (21); ELISA with MAb 1F4 produced strong and equivalent binding to both the wild-type and infectious clone (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the EDI, EDIII, and EDI/II hinge region is the epitope for MAb 14C10, which also bound similarly between the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic (Fig. 2B). Finally, MAb 1C19.2, an EDIII antibody, also bound similarly to both wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic (Fig. 2C).

Small changes in binding conformation may induce enhancement versus neutralization; as such, these assays must be equivalent between the infectious clone and the wild-type virus to justify the use of rDENVic for vaccine and immunogenicity studies. Using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), we examined the ability of well-defined MAbs to block virus infectivity. For all three DENV1 monoclonal antibodies (1F4, 14C10, and 1C19.2), percent neutralization was nearly identical between the wild-type DENV1 and rDENV1ic (Fig. 3A to C). Similar to ELISA results, monoclonal antibodies against the other DENV serotypes were unable to neutralize either the clone or wild-type virus (Fig. 3D to F). Extending studies to a U937+DC-SIGN flow-based neutralization assay, percent infection results revealed overlapping neutralization of rDENV1ic and wild-type DENV1 following DENV1 monoclonal antibody incubations (Fig. S1A to C). In addition, none of the other DENV serotype-specific antibodies provides any significant reduction in viral infection (Fig. S1D to F). Together, the results match the ELISA data and indicate antibody neutralization fidelity between the infectious clone and wild-type viruses in two independent neutralization assays.",

A high-resolution structure of 5H2 bound to DENV4 E protein has led to the identification of 17 residues within EDI that interact with the antibody (Table 1) (24, 25). Of these 17 amino acids, five are conserved between DENV1 and DENV4. The remaining 12 residues in DENV1 were replaced with those from DENV4, by manipulating plasmid A of the DENV1 infectious clone (rDENV1ic-5H2-epitope [rDENV1ic-EDI]) (Fig. 4A) (Table 1). The DENV4 MAb 5H2 bound and neutralized the rDENV1ic-EDI virus (Fig. 4B and C).

Importantly, 1F4 has more than one-third of its predicted contact residues replaced in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus (Fig. 5A and Table 1). Insertion of the DENV4 5H2 epitope partially disrupted the DENV1 1F4 epitope, resulting in an 80-fold reduction in 50% effective concentration (EC50) but not complete ablation in binding of 1F4 to rDENV1ic-EDI (Fig. 5B). Similarly, neutralization assays indicate that 1F4 nearly lost all of its ability to neutralize the rDENV1ic-EDI mutant (Fig. 5C). MAb 14C10 has a smaller percentage (15%) of its epitope disrupted in the rDENV1ic-EDI virus (Fig. 5D and Table 1), as it has additional contact residues in EDIII from the neighboring dimer that are maintained (Fig. S2) (26). Despite this smaller percentage, binding of 14C10 is still reduced (Fig. 5E), and 14C10 neutralization of rDENV1ic-EDI is mostly lost (Fig. 5F). In contrast, DENV1 monoclonal antibody E103, which targets an EDIII epitope (Fig. 5G) (27), had no significant reduction in ELISA binding relative to wild-type virus or the infectious clone (Fig. 5H). Additionally, MAb E103 maintained robust neutralization, indicating maintenance of other DENV1 epitopes within the mutant virus (Fig. 5I). In summary, the introduction of the 5H2 epitope residues to create the rDENV1ic-EDI virus leads to efficient display of a heterologous DENV4 epitope and the disruption of two native DENV1 type-specific epitopes. Our results illustrate the utility of the infectious clone for transferring DENV epitopes between serotypes and identify functional consequences on other conserved epitopes within the transferred amino acid regions.",

In this study, we further characterize a novel DENV1 molecular clone platform that is patterned after coronavirus systems and describe additional details, including transcript infectivity and recombinant virus phenotypes in vitro (19, 28\u201331). Generating a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the entire genome, the divided DENV1 reverse genetic system overcomes toxic elements within itself and allows propagation in bacteria. Importantly, directional assembly and in vitro transcription allow electroporation of full-length infectious RNA that directly corresponds to the wild-type virus sequence. As a result, the virus derived from the infectious clone maintains similar replication in multiple cell types (Fig. 1E to G) as well as complete fidelity in regard to antibody binding and virus neutralization (Fig. 2 and 3). Building on previous epitope swap mutants (19, 32), we employed this reverse genetic system to generate a DENV1 viral mutant that displayed a known monoclonal antibody epitope from DENV4, gaining 5H2 monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization to the donor sequence strain. However, the mutant virus also disrupted binding and neutralization of two DENV1-specific monoclonal antibodies despite retaining the majority of their targeted antigenic residues (Table 1 and Fig. 5). While other DENV1-specific monoclonal antibodies maintain effective binding and neutralization (Fig. 5C), the data highlight the opportunity cost of domain swaps even in the context of partial epitope disruption. Overall, the results also illustrate the utility of this newly developed infectious clone systems as a platform to study DENV1 infection, pathogenesis, and immunity.",

            "text": "For the DENV vaccine field, this reverse genetic system amplifies opportunities in virus design that are already being explored. Previous work by our lab has utilized the DENV2 and DENV4 infectious clones to define and transfer a critical antibody binding epitope in DENV2 identified by structural analysis (22, 32). In this case, we described a recombinant DENV4 virus that displayed a heterologous DENV2 epitope, while preserving the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV4 (32). In addition, previous work using this DENV1 infectious clone was able to transfer part of the DENV3 MAb 5J7 epitope, resulting in a partial gain of binding and neutralization by 5J7 but no loss of binding to DENV1 MAb 1F4 (19). Importantly, both the DENV2 2D22 and DENV3 5J7 MAb epitopes are distinct from the 1F4 and 14C10 epitopes transplanted here. Coupled with data from the current study, the approach to disrupt epitopes within the context of live virus highlights an independent and powerful approach to quickly validate structural predictions of key residues. Importantly, full characterization of these viral epitopes and their portability between DENV serotypes open new approaches to vaccine development. This work defines a rationally designed chimeric virus that uses MAb-envelope structural interactions to identify residues associated with the DENV4 MAb 5H2 epitope that were sufficient for the gain of binding and neutralization. These changes lead to the disruption of multiple overlapping DENV1 epitopes, highlighting a potential problem that must be addressed in DENV vaccine design. Interestingly, despite maintaining nearly two-thirds of the DENV1 1F4 epitope in the chimeric virus, binding and neutralization were almost completely lost, indicating that the critical residue determinants for antibody interactions were among those that were changed. Another DENV1 MAb, 14C10, which maintained a much larger percentage of its epitope in the chimeric virus, lost a smaller amount of binding yet still lost nearly complete neutralization by 14C10. This suggests that while the remaining epitope can still be partially bound by 14C10, the interaction is insufficient to fully neutralize the virus. Structure-guided design could identify additional residues to further expand the transplanted DENV4 epitope to fully ablate DENV1 MAb and polyclonal binding and neutralization. Together, these data illustrate the utility of mapping epitopes using a combination of structure and reveres genetics. With a similar approach employed for human norovirus (33\u201337), these resources can be applied to generate diagnostic reagents and to create a map of epitopes ideal for designing chimeric bivalent vaccines that produce broad-spectrum neutralization, a critical issue in DENV pathogenesis.",

Importantly, both antibody binding and virus neutralization indicate uniform antigenicity with the wild-type strain permitting epitope mapping. Coupled with structural studies, the reverse genetic system can be manipulated to produce chimeric vaccines harboring conserved epitopes from multiple serotypes. While it is unlikely that neutralizing epitopes from all four serotypes could be combined into a single viable chimeric DENV virus, it is possible that two bivalent viruses that contain neutralizing epitopes from all four serotypes (e.g., rDENV1/3 and rDENV4/2) could be generated.
