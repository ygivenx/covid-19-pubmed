Baseline data taken during the first visit while in the stable state included amongst others exacerbation history, medications, comorbidities, spirometry and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2007) categorisation. Patients were given a telephone number to a study nurse, whom they would contact in case of an exacerbation. Patients with an exacerbation according to a predefined set of symptoms were scheduled for an appointment with a study physician the next working day. During exacerbations, nasopharynx swabs were sampled and two different markers for the severity of the exacerbation were scored. After an exacerbation a control visit was scheduled. During the study period 154 patients had at least one exacerbation and in total 325 exacerbations were included in BCES, of which 88 exacerbation samples were tested in the current study.",

Niesters, the Netherlands), were spiked in 200 \u03bcl of the virus transport medium in which the nasopharyngeal swab was stored. Nucleic acids were extracted directly from 200 \u03bcl clinical sample using the Magnapure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small volume extraction kit on the MagnaPure 96 system (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands) with 100 \u03bcL output eluate (an updated version of the isolation method used for qPCR, tested previously [20]). Extraction buffer was used as negative control (for extraction, library preparation, and sequencing). For library preparation, 7 \u03bcl of nucleic acids were used, using the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae, with several in-house adaptations to the manufacturers protocol in order to enable simultaneous detection of both DNA and RNA. The following steps were omitted: poly A mRNA capture isolation, rRNA depletion and DNase treatment step. This resulted in a single tube per sample throughout library preparation containing both DNA and RNA. Metagenomic sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and approximately 10 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample were obtained.",

RV-C was first identified in 2006 and associated with high symptom burdens in children and asthmatics [28, 29]. Recently, an asthma-related cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) gene variant [30] was associated with greater RV-C receptor display on pulmonary cell surfaces of children and adults, and associated with higher susceptibility to severe virus-triggered asthma episodes [31, 32]. In line, Romero-Espinoza et al detected predominantly RV-C in children with acute asthma exacerbations by mNGS [33]. The significance of RV-C infection in the adult population is less well studied. Although RV-C has been previously associated with exacerbations of COPD [34, 35], to our knowledge, to date, CDHR3 polymorphisms have not yet found to be associated with COPD.",

Alternatively, others have hypothesized that viral and microbial diversity may play a role in infection susceptibility and the development of acute and chronic respiratory diseases [33]. Our results indicate that virome dysbiosis may be accompanied by bacteriome dysbiosis, though no significant differences were detected in line with other reports [40, 41]. However, these studies don\u2019t compare between COPD exacerbation with and without viral infections. Others have found a higher phage abundance in a patient with severe COPD when compared with one patients with moderate COPD and healthy controls, DNA sequencing, in line with the hypothesis of a state of dysbiosis that increases with disease progression [27]. In COPD patients, viral infections have been suggested to trigger bacterial overgrowth and infections [42, 43], demonstrating the significance of viral-bacterial interactions.

Although the percentage of proteobacteria was relatively high when compared to other studies of the nasopharyngeal microbiome, our swabs are sampled during COPD exacerbations [44, 45].

Studies comparing the respiratory virome during stable disease and exacerbations are needed to determine a potential correlation between the virome/bacteriome during stable state and disease progression or exacerbation frequency.",

Furthermore, highly divergent viruses with sequences deviating from their representative NCBI RefSeq sequences may have been missed, as has been described by others [46].
