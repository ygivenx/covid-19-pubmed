The laboratory mouse is genetically and immunologically defined, and a large collection of genetically modified animals exists. However, mice can not be infected with HBV. Several lines of transgenic mice with replication competent HBV genomes have been established and represented to be powerful tools for HBV research [5]. However, HBV replication in the transgenic mice is generated from the integrated HBV sequence harbored in all hepatocytes, which is different from what occurs during a natural infection [5-8]. The presence of HBV genomes in these mouse lines inevitably induces immune tolerance to the HBV antigens. In addition, the capability of production of transgenic mouse model is not readily available in ordinary laboratory conditions. Transplant mouse models were established and used for different studies [9-11]. However, the models are based on immunodeficient mouse strains and difficult to handle in the laboratory.",

In 40% of injected C56BL/6 mice, the persistence of HBV surface antigenemia (HBsAg) was greater than 6 months. HBV persistence is determined by the mouse genetic background and plasmid backbone [12]. The HBV HI mouse model is a highly interesting model for testing vaccination strategies and mechanisms of viral persistence [14-18]. This model may be used to the study replication competence of HBV constructs [15]. Previously, the established HBV HI mouse models were based on HBV genotype A replication-competent clones [12,13]. As HBV genotypes B and C are highly prevalent in Asia and may have distinct virological characteristics that correlate with clinical outcomes in the natural course of infection and antiviral therapy, it is warranted to establish HBV HI mouse models with characterized HBV strains.",

However, the current therapies have only a limited success rate and frequent viral recurrence after cessation of therapy, therefore, new antiviral strategies are required [19,20]. RNA interference has been developed as potential therapeutic approaches [21-24]. In previous studies, siRNAs targeting different regions of the HBV genome were used. The HBx gene encodes a small non-structural protein that has diverse functions and is required for HBV efficient replication [25,26]. The HBx mRNA contains the common sequence of the four transcripts of HBV [25,27,28], which makes it a potentially useful target for antiviral therapy.",

Each group contained 10 mice. Initially, HBsAg levels in mice were significantly reduced by HI in the presence of pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 plasmids at 1 dpi (p < 0.05), compared with the control groups receiving empty vectors (Figure 6A). However, the HBsAg levels in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice quickly increased during the follow up and reached the levels of the control at 14 dpi. In contrast, the HBsAg levels in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice were inhibited to a significantly lower degree before the 28 dpi compared with the control groups (p < 0.05). HBsAg became detectable in some mice at 42 dpi. It is worthy to note that the majority (7 of 10) of the mice received pSR-HBxi285 were HBsAg negative during the whole experimental period (Table 2). HBV DNA concentrations in mouse sera were determined and were well correlated with HBsAg levels (Figure 6B). Figure 6C shows that the HBsAg positive rate in pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 treated mice was significantly decreased in comparison to the controls at 1 dpi. Thereafter, the positive rate of HBsAg in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice increased gradually and showed no significant difference in comparison to the control at 7 dpi. The positive rate of HBsAg in pSR-HBxi285 treated mice remained at a lower level (18.2-27.3%) than other groups until the 4th week post injection (wpi) but showed similar levels to the other groups in the 5th wpi. Consistently, immunostaining of HBcAg in the liver section of mice after HI demonstrated that the co-application of pSR-HBxi285 or pBS-HBxi285 abolished HBcAg expression in the mouse liver at 3 dpi (Figure 6D). However, HBcAg may become detectable in the mouse liver which received pSR-HBxi285 similar to those of control mice 4 weeks after HI. The results indicated that HBxi285 could significantly inhibit the HBsAg production and HBV replication. However the vector pSR-HBxi285 was more efficient in reducing HBsAg and HBV DNA levels than that of pSB-HBxi285.",

Different hepatitis B virus genotypes may have distinct virologic characteristics, which may correlate with antiviral curative effects and clinical outcome [29,30]. The majority of HBV infections are distributed in the Asia-Pacific region. In these regions, patients are mainly infected with genotypes B and C. Previous studies showed that in China and Taiwan, approximately 90% of patients under thirty-five years old who are infected with HBV would develop HCC and most of them carried an HBV genotype B infection [30,31]. Now, we have a system at hand to examine the replication of HBV genotype B clone in the mouse models.",

The plasmid with 1.3 fold genomes containing a complete extra copy of the entire EnhI, Enh II and HBx gene as shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1B which is a suitable HBV construct for transfection and HI experiments. When the cloned plasmids were transfected into Huh-7 cells or hydrodynamically injected into BALB/c mice, pBS-HBV1.3B demonstrated significantly high-level replication and gene expression in comparison to pBS-HBV1.1B and pBS-HBV1.2B (Figure 1). Increasing the length of the 1.3 fold over length HBV genome did not further improve the replication competence. Nevertheless, the replication competence declined and could not reach the original level of HBV in nature infection state when the length is less than 1.2 fold of the HBV genome. Durantel et al. and other groups used 1.1 fold over length HBV genome for studies on drug resistant HBV isolates [32,33]. However, they added strong foreign promoters to enhance the HBV transcription and replication. In conclusion, the 1.3 fold HBV genome length containing a complete extra copy of the entire EnhI, EnhII and HBx gene as described in the present study could be regarded as an optimal length for HBV replication constructs with the authentic HBV sequence, independent on a foreign promoter.",

Therefore, we further investigated the anti-viral effect of vector-expressed HBx siRNA in this model. Co-application of the HBx siRNA expression plasmids treatment of these mice induced a significant inhibition of HBV replication and expression. When pAAV-HBV1.3B was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice with either pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285, HBV expression and replication were efficiently inhibited. There are two methods commonly used to silence target genes. Chemical synthesized siRNAs have a good specificity and are commonly used on cells by transfection. However, such siRNAs, if not chemically modified, are instable and eliminated rapidly in vitro and in vivo. The production of siRNAs, particularly with specific chemical modifications, is very expensive. Another approach is to use siRNA transcription vectors. The disadvantages to use such as retroviral vectors are, for example, the lower transfection efficiency and slow action compared with chemical synthesized siRNA. However, the vector-based approach has some advantages regarding the stability and costs. It is important to prolong the expression of siRNAs to maintain the inhibition of HBV. Moreover, when the pSuper.Retro vector was transfected into a packaging cell line such as 293 T cell line, it could produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA) [39,40].",

The pSuper.Retro vector contains the H1 promoter which is a RNA polymerase III like promoter and can transcript shRNA steadily, and showed persistent inhibitory effect in vitro[46,47]. The pSuper.Retro vector includes 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal LTR structure of murine stem cell virus. The pSuper.Retro vectors can be transfected into a packaging cell line to produce retroviral supernatants and obtain a higher rate of stable cell integration. In addition, this vector contains an incomplete packaging signal and could not produce recombinant retroviruses (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA). pSuper.Basic is a pUC origin vector (The Manual of pSuper RNAi system, OligoEngine, Washington, USA) and used to compare the stability with pSuper.Retro in vivo. The difference of both vectors in the gene silencing effects is likely due to their stability in vivo. HBx protein plays an important role in HBV replication and HBV induced HCC [26,48]. Therefore, HBx became a good target gene for gene silencing in recent years. Importantly, as all HBV RNA transcripts share the same sequence in the HBx due to its unique transcription mechanism, siRNAs targeting the HBx region actually knock down all HBV RNAs, as shown in the previous studies [28,49,50].",

It is known that siRNA-specific features such as low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3\u2032-terminus, lack of inverted repeats, and sense strand base preference, interaction with the cellular machinery called RISC and so on are likely to contribute to efficient RNAi process. The relative influence of these parameters is not fully understood and now under investigation by many groups [51-56]. When pAAV-HBV1.3B and pSB-HBxi285 or pSR-HBxi285 was co-injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice, HBV expression and replication could be significantly inhibited by the first week. Thereafter, the antiviral effect declined in the pSB-HBxi285 treated mice, whereas the antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi285 was maintained for at least 4 weeks. These results indicated that the retroviral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmid could much more effectively inhibit HBV expression and replication than the non-viral vector based HBx siRNA expression plasmids. Among the mice which received pSR-HBxi285, HBV replication was completely suppressed in the majority of mice, as no HBsAg was detectable for the whole experimental period of 16 weeks. However, HBV gene expression and replication may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, indicating that transient suppression of HBV replication by HBx siRNA may also fail to clear HBV completely in some individuals. It is worth to mention that the change of serum HBsAg and HBV DNA in the mice after the application with HBx siRNAs occurred with different kinetics. The reason may be the different requirement of HBsAg translation and HBV DNA replication. It is well established that only a small fraction of HBsAg is required for virion production [57]. In the patients with chronic HBV infection, HBV DNA loads do not correlated with HBsAg [58]. Our results suggest that measures to prolong the antiviral effect of the siRNA should be investigated in future studies.",
