It maintains ER homeostasis by increasing protein-folding capacity, reducing global protein synthesis, and clearing misfolded proteins [1\u20133]. Protein loads and quality within the ER lumen are monitored by three transmembrane proteins: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcriptional factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) [4,5]. These sensors are normally kept in an inactive state by GRP78 (also known as BiP or HSPA5), which is an ER-resident chaperone and the master regulator of UPR [6,7]. Under ER stress conditions, GRP78 detaches from the sensors to allow their activation as it proceeds to binds to exposed hydrophobic regions of nascent polypeptides [6,8].",

            "text": "The three sensors regulated by GRP78 control distinct pathways. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1. Although this leads to global translational attenuation, it does allow the preferential translation of a subset of stress-related mRNAs, including the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [9\u201311], which is a pro-survival protein that regulates the expression of stress-related genes involved in anti-oxidation, amino acid biosynthesis and transport, apoptosis, etc [12\u201315]. Sensor ATF6 can detect folding perturbations such as disruptions in disulfide bonding and protein under-glycosylation, and its activation leads to its translocation and cleavage within Golgi by host proteases to release a transcriptionally-active fragment that induces expression of genes involved in protein folding, such as GRP78, PDI and GRP94, etc [1,16\u201319]. Lastly, the IRE1-XBP1 branch is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and responds to all types of ER stress [20,21]. Activated IRE1 has the endoribonuclease activity and splices many mRNA targets destined for translation at the ER, which causes IRE1-dependent mRNA decay [22,23]. Although most of the target mRNAs are degraded, the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA produces a functional transcript that encodes the transcription factor XBP1s, which controls the expression of many target genes involved in lipid synthesis, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and chaperones [24\u201326].",

In particular, the virus appears to hijack ATF4 to viral replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) to facilitate viral RNA synthesis. Thus, our results reveal that PRRSV exploits UPR signaling for its own advantage.",

When levels of misfolded proteins rise, GRP78 is released, resulting in activation of the UPR [7]. For many DNA and RNA viruses, their infections cause increased levels of GRP78, which is also a chaperone, so that the protein folding capacity of the cell can be enhanced [43\u201345]. In the case of PRRSV, we observed an elevation of GRP78 at the mRNA level in both PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (used for in vitro propagation of the virus; Fig 1A) and primary PAMs (porcine alveolar macrophages, the major in vivo cell target; Fig 1C). But in spite of these increases, we found that GRP78 protein levels actually declined as the infection proceeded (Fig 1B and 1D). In contrast, treatment with the potent ER-stress inducer thapsigargin (TG) resulted in a dramatic increase of GRP78 (Fig 1B), indicating that uninfected cells have the capacity to produce large amounts of this protein.",

Additions of DMSO, Bafilomycin A1, or Z-VAD-FMK did not have a significant effect, but treatment with MG-132 restored GRP78 to a level similar to that of uninfected cells (Fig 1E).

In contrast, the minor envelope protein GP2a did not increase GRP78 expression (S2A Fig) but instead caused a decrease of this protein in about 50% of the cells (S2B Fig). This activity was confirmed by Western blot analyses in a dose-response experiment, which showed that increasing levels of GP2a caused decreasing levels of GRP78 (Fig 1F), and this effect could be reversed by treatment of the cells with MG-132 (Fig 1G). Because subgenomic mRNA2 contains the open reading frames for both GP2a and the E protein, we made constructs that eliminate the start codon for E (construct GP2a\u0394E-HA) or express only the E protein (E-HA). The results show that GP2a but not E protein decreased levels of GRP78 (Fig 1H).",

Similar results were observed in infected, primary PAMs (Fig 3B, 3D and 3F); however, the antibodies to ATF6 did not work on PAMs extracts, and PDI was used as a surrogate since its expression is subject to regulation by ATF6 [46].",

The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated and probed for the presence of ATF4 and XBP1s (Fig 5A). The quality of the fractionation was checked by assaying for cytoplasmic GAPDH and nuclear histone subunit H3. As expected, TG-treatment and PRRSV infection upregulated the expression of both ATF4 and XBP1s (Fig 5A, compare lanes 1 and 4 with lane 3). In the case of XBP1s, the protein was enriched in the nuclear fraction whether the cells were treated with TG (compare lanes 5 and 9) or infected (compare lanes 8 and 12). To our surprise, ATF4 behaved differently. In TG-treated cells, this protein was almost exclusively found in the nuclear fraction (compare lanes 5 and 9), but in infected cells, it was found almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction (compare lanes 8 and 12). In addition, PRRSV infection blocked the TG-induced ATF4 nuclear translocation (Fig 5A, compare lanes 6 and 10). Thus, PRRSV appears to have a mechanism for retaining ATF4 in the cytoplasm.",

Moreover, ATF4 was found to co-localize very well with PRRSV nsp2 and nsp9 (Fig 5B, right panels), which are key components of viral replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) [47], suggesting that ATF4 is hijacked to viral RTCs during infection. Similar results were obtained in PRRSV-infected primary PAMs (S4 Fig). Consistent with cytoplasmic retention, the canonical ATF4-target genes GADD34 and ASNS [48] were not upregulated during infection as compared with the mock or TG-treated cells (S3B and S3C Fig). Also, we found that this phenomenon is independent of PRRSV strain used (S5 Fig) and unique to PRRSV (S6 Fig), since it was not observed with several other RNA viruses, including equine arteritis virus (EAV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).",

We found that PRRSV nsp2 was able to partially retain ATF4 in the cytoplasm (Fig 5C and S7B Fig), but co-expression with nsp3, which is known to form heterodimer with nsp2, dramatically increased the retention efficiency, even though nsp3 by itself\u2014like nsp5\u2014did not have any activity (Fig 5C). The interaction between nsp2 and endogenous ATF4 was also confirmed with a co-IP assay using infected cell lysates (Fig 5D).

Similar finding was observed in primary PAMs (Fig 6B). The detection of ATF4 was earlier than observed with Western blots (Fig 3), and this is likely because a low MOI was used (0.1). Because most cells are not infected, the IFA would be expected to have greater sensitivity because it enables the detection of protein expression at the single cell level.

Consistent with this, RNAi knockdown of ATF4 greatly reduced the level of total viral RNAs, as measured by RT-qPCR analysis (Fig 7A), and this correlated well with the impaired virus production (Fig 4C). To investigate which step of viral RNA synthesis was affected, we measured the relative abundance of negative- and positive-stranded RNAs in MARC-145 cells that had been transfected with either siRNA-ATF4 or the scrambled siNC 36 h prior to infection. RNA levels were analyzed during a single viral replication cycle (i.e., within 12 hours) by RT-qPCR amplifying ORF7 RNA and calculating the amount present relative to the RNA from GAPDH, a house-keeping gene. The relative abundance of each viral RNA was then calculated as the ratio of the siRNA-ATF4-treated group compared to the siNC-treated control. As expected, no negative-stranded viral RNAs could be detected in either the control or siATF4-treated cells at 0 hpi (Fig 7B). At 4\u201312 hpi, this RNA became detectable, but its accumulation was greatly reduced when ATF4 was depleted. Positive-stranded RNA could be detected at 0 hpi due to the input of virions used to start the infection, but a gradual, obvious decrease was observed over time (Fig 7C). We also measured the abundance of all subgenomic mRNAs with primers that specifically amplify the leader-body junctions. The results show that reduced ATF4 expression had an effect on all RNA species regardless of the strands (S8A and S8B Fig), suggesting that this protein is a host factor required for viral RNA synthesis.",

As negative controls, neither the ATF4 antibodies nor the GST-ATF4 chimera pulled down GAPDH RNA (Fig 7E and 7G).

It is likely that the ERAD pathway is utilized to retrotranslocate GPR78 into the cytosol, where proteasomes reside [52], but the details of how GP2a might cause this remain to be elucidated. In any case, downregulation of GRP78 was surprising because many viruses, especially enveloped viruses and ER-tropic viruses (e.g., the flaviviruses and coronaviruses), quickly produce large amounts of membrane proteins and thereby place a large burden on the folding machinery in the ER [53\u201355]. In response to this stress, most viruses tend to upregulate chaperon GRP78 and other factors to meet the increased demand for folding and post-translational modifications [56]. This is not the case for PRRSV. Because GRP78 is the master regulator, its reduced accumulation likely prevents any modulation of the UPR, keeping the ER stress pathways induced for the benefit of the virus. In addition to providing downstream factors such as ATF4 that this virus utilizes for replication, the reduced levels of GRP78 will likely result in increased levels of misfolded cellular proteins, potentially aiding in immune evasion [42,57,58]. What remains unclear is how PRRSV promotes the folding of its own proteins in this situation.",

With regard to the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 signaling branch of the UPR, previous studies of how viruses utilize ATF4 have only revealed effects that depend upon its activity as a DNA transcription factor. For example, in the cases of West Nile virus (WNV) and Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) [59,60], ATF4 upregulates transcription factor CHOP to induce apoptosis and virus release. In these cases, activation takes place during the late stages of infection, after high titers of viruses have been made. Other viruses (e.g., HSV-1 and dengue virus) use ATF4 to upregulate GADD34 to antagonize eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [61,62]. In the case of retroviruses (e.g., HIV), ATF4 has been found to be diverted and bound to viral promoters to mediate transcriptional activation, and thus virus replication [63].",

This property of PRRSV appears to be similar to that of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [64], where high levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 and activation of ATF4 were found without subsequent expression of GADD34; however, in that work, the authors did not examine possible roles for, or the intracellular location of, ATF4.",

When this protein was depleted with siRNAs, the accumulation of viral RNA was severely attenuated for both the positive and negative strands. Indeed, the effect seems to be equal on the accumulation of all viral RNA species at the transcriptional level, suggesting that ATF4 serves as a general facilitator for viral RNA biogenesis. This is unlike host RNA helicase DDX1, which is relocated to the cytoplasm in coronavirus infections [65] and is needed for the synthesis of much longer viral RNA species [66]. Further evidence supporting the association of ATF4 with the replication machinery of PRRSV includes its interaction with viral RNA in pulldown assays and co-localization with negative-strand RNAs during infection. Whatever its exact role, depletion of this component of the UPR led to a dramatic attenuation of PRRSV titers, whereas overexpression increased the viral yield. Future studies are needed to dissect how exactly ATF4 promotes RNA biogenesis and to identify the ATF4-interacting domain or motif within PRRSV so that a mutant virus can be tested for vaccine development.",

In tumors, ATF4 expression is detected in hypoxic- and nutrient-deprived regions where it promotes metabolic homeostasis and cancer cell survival by transcriptionally regulating amino acid uptake and biosynthesis, autophagy, redox balance and angiogenesis [15,67\u201369]. As ATF4 is normally expressed at low levels and is not essential for normal cells, this molecule serves as a potential target for drug development in both human and veterinary medicine. Currently, there are no approved drugs for this target, and a search for one is warranted.",

            "text": "We also found that PRRSV is dependent on XBP1s. The IRE1 branch of the UPR is linked to many functions, such as apoptosis through the IRE1-mediated RIDD and JNK pathways, inflammation through IRE1-ASK pathway, autophagy, ERAD, and lipid synthesis through activation of XBP1s [23,24,26,70,71]. Our study showed that IRE1 is activated in infected cells, consistent with two previous reports [41,51]. While it is clear that the downstream effector XBP1s is important for virus replication the mechanism was not further explored here. There are several ways that XBP1s might be important. One is for fulfilling the increased demand for lipid synthesis, as the replication of some viruses, including PRRSV, often involves extensive modulation, rearrangement and capture of intracellular membranes into virions [24,25,72]. Second, XBP1s may be important for regulation of autophagy [71]. Indeed, XBP1s has been shown to be an important regulator of genes involved in autophagy biogenesis, such as LC3, ULK1, ATG4, Beclin1, and Bcl2 [31,71,73]. Third, XBP1s may facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins via the ERAD pathway and thereby increase the folding capability via protein chaperones [5,74]. PRRSV appears to be different from closely-related coronaviruses in its requirement for XBP1s signaling. For example, MHV induces splicing of XBP1 but suppresses the activation of its downstream target genes [64]. Also, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) triggers the activation of IRE1-XBP1s signaling, but this pathway is not required for viral replication [75]. In any case, since XBP1s is a stress-inducing gene product and normally expressed at low level, it represents a potential antiviral target for PRRSV.",

At 36 h post transfection, the cells were infected with PRRSV strain JXwn06 at an MOI of 1. The abundance of viral RNA was assessed by RT-PCR of ORF7, normalized against the house-keeping gene GAPDH, and then compared to siNC control at 0 to 12 hpi. (B and C) The same as (A) except the abundance of positive- and negative stranded RNAs were analyzed by RT-qPCR at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hpi. (D) Control, rabbit IgG or antibodies specific for ATF4 were used for immunoprecipitations from lysates of infected MARC-145 cells (MOI = 0.1, 36 hpi). The presence of viral RNA was assayed by RT-qPCR targeting 5\u2019-UTR sequence or (E) GAPDH as a negative control, and the fold enrichment was calculated against the normal rabbit IgG group. (F) GST-ATF4 or GST were purified from E. coli (left panel) and added to RNA extracted from PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells in an in vitro binding assay. RT-qPCR with primers specific for a 5\u2019UTR sequence was used to detect viral RNA (middle panel) and the fold of enrichment of viral RNA was expressed against the GST control. (G) In parallel, the pull down of cellular GAPDH mRNA was used as a negative control. (H) To look for ATF4 within viral replication compartments in infected MARC-145 cells (MOI = 0.1, 24 hpi), the negative-strand RNA was detected by the RNAscope in situ hybridization method, and ATF4 and nsp9 were detected by immunostaining. Data information: Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, and error bars indicate standard deviations (SD) of means. Asterisks (*) indicate the statistical significance: ***, P < 0.001; ****, P<0.0001; NS, no significance (n = 3 experiments in each condition).
