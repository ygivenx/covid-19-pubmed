Today, tens of thousands of genomes are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [3], [4], and whole-genome sequencing/re-sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior. In some fields, researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [5] to explore microbial diversity, while elsewhere, hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation, to support pangenome reconstruction [6], [7], [8], and to build maps of microbial variomes [9]. Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems, including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [10], the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [11], [12], and the 2011 German Escherichia coli outbreak [13], [14].",

Modern bioinformatics must be high throughput and high volume with a strong emphasis on comparative genomics, and the SEED family of resources for genome interpretation and analysis were specifically constructed to embody these characteristics [15]. The SEED resources are built upon the organization of biology into a modular set of subsystems, each describing a specific biological functionality (e.g., flagellar motility or histidine biosynthesis) [16]. Subsystems-based technologies were developed in the SEED with the view that the interpretation of one genome can be made more efficient and consistent if hundreds of genomes are simultaneously annotated in one subsystem at a time [16], [17]. The SEED Project, a multi-institutional effort coordinated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) and Argonne National Laboratory, began with the ambitious goal of consistently annotating 1,000 genomes (http://theseed.org/wiki/Annotating_1000_genomes); today, over 50,000 viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated by the subsystems technology. More recently, the SEED Project has been expanded to include the capacity to automatically generate genome-scale metabolic models based on SEED annotations of genome sequences, and the Model SEED system developed from this pipeline has now been applied to construct metabolic models for thousands of genomes [18], [19], [20]. The SEED family of resources now collectively serves as a repository for almost 5,000 distinct complete prokaryotic genomes, associated with approximately 30,000 annotations, 11,000 metabolic models, 178,000 protein families, 10,250 functional roles, and 1,060 subsystems.",

To truly expose the SEED data for efficient large-scale use by the global scientific community, we initially developed a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server to allow the needed programmatic access to the SEED data [21]; however, the SOAP server could not scale up with the increased volume of data. To cope with the increasing demands placed on the SEED web services, as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the SEED resources, we developed a second-generation of web services to improve throughput, response time, and access to SEED functionality.

The program then uses these lists to obtain detailed data on all the E. coli compounds and reactions (using the \u201cget_compound_data\u201d and \u201cget_reaction_data\u201d functions, respectively). These data are stored in two tables: one for compounds and one for reactions. Next the \u201cclassify_model_entities\u201d function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E. coli model. In this particular FVA, the reactions and compounds in the E. coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media (called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model). At this point, the data returned by the \u201cclassify_model_entities\u201d function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously. In the next step, the code uses the \u201csimulate_model_growth\u201d function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E. coli model, maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media (called Carbon-D-Glucose in the Model SEED). The data returned by this function are also added to the reaction and compound tables. In the final call to the server, the program uses the \u201csimulate_all_single_gene_knockout\u201d function to simulate the single knockout of all E. coli genes, and the results of this study are stored in a gene table. The remainder of the program handles the printing of the compound, reaction, and gene tables to the files CompoundTbl.txt, ReactionTbl.txt, and GeneTbl.txt, respectively.",

The server abstraction layer required the loading of numerous large modules on each invocation of server functionality, resulting in a noticeable delay in response to each server request. The encapsulation of the results in SOAP XML conferred significant overhead on the data being transferred. Finally, each operation of the SOAP server was atomic, accepting a single argument and returning a single datum. Trivial requests such as retrieving all the functions for all of the proteins in a genome took unacceptably long to complete, requiring a separate call for each protein and instantiating many threads on the server.",

In comparison to the SOAP server [21], the new web services provide access to larger amounts of data in less time, and they have been engineered to respond to server requests with little or no server-side delay. Furthermore, the new web services provide a more efficient and flexible computing approach because they are designed to process batches of requests at a time, streaming the responses as they complete. These services provide access to the integrated genomic data, subsystems, FIGfams, co-occurrence data, annotation services, RAST annotation submission and job retrieval (thereby offering access to our continuing improvements in microbial annotation), and metabolic modeling.
