In addition, high-definition videos have been used to estimate the dispersion distance of smoke particles, which mimicked exhaled aerosol released from non-invasive ventilation and mask ventilation [23,24]. Ari et al. [25] examined the mechanical ventilation of a patient with and without expiratory filters, and in the cases without use of a filter, a 160-fold increase of the deposited drug was observed on the exhaust port. It was estimated that greater than 45% of the nominal dose could be fugitively released. Saeed et al. [26] examined exhalation filters when using jet and vibrating mesh nebulisers (VMN) and found that up to 50% of the generated aerosol was released from the system, as fugitive aerosol, into the surrounding environment.",

The nose\u2013throat models were connected to a breathing simulator (Harvard Apparatus Dual Phase Control Respirator, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) via a collecting filter (RespirGard II 303, Baxter, Dublin, Ireland). A healthy adult breath pattern (tidal volume 500 mL, breath rate 15 BPM and inspiratory: expiratory ratio 1:1) and a healthy paediatric breathing pattern (tidal volume 250 mL, breath rate 25 BPM and inspiratory: expiratory ratio 1:2) were used. Inhaled dose was determined by quantifying the mass of drug on a filter positioned distal to the trachea. The tracheostomy interface and tracheostomy tube were attached directly to a collecting filter. Additional figures containing photographs of the three different combinations of the test rigs are supplied as supplementary material (Figures S1\u2013S3).",

            "text": "The results indicate that the inhaled dose (%) decreased with an increased gas-flow rate. The only exception was the nasal cannula at the paediatric breathing profiles at 10 L/min, which had a lower inhaled dose than at 20 L/min. Although there is no clear explanation for this result, one potential reason may be that at 20 L/min more aerosol was forced through the system, including, perhaps, some drug that has rained out in the head model. All the remaining trends were consistent with other studies. Perry et al. [13] examined the inhaled dose during high-flow nasal cannula therapy using the Aerogen Solo device. For simulated adult breathing, the inhaled doses were found to be 0.8% and 0.2% for gas-flow rates of 10 and 40 L/min, respectively. However, this study found 5.35 \u00b1 2.81% and 2.56 \u00b1 1.38% for 10 and 40 L/min, respectively. During simulated paediatric breathing, 1.2, 0.1 and 0% were found for gas-flow rates of 3, 10 and 20 L/min, as compared to this study\u2019s findings of 3.23 \u00b1 1.58, 0.42 \u00b1 0.06 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.28% for flow rates of 2, 10 and 20 L/min. Dailey et al. [36] examined the inhaled dose using a high-flow nasal cannula and reported considerably higher values of 26.7% to 27.4% at 10 L/min, 11.6% to 14.2% at 30 L/min and 3.5% to 5.9% at 50 L/min. Perry et al. [13] used a lower tidal volume for the paediatric breathing profiles setting than the present study; while Dailey et al. used an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, an Albuterol sulphate mixture (2.5 mg/0.5 mL). Neither study reported the length of the tubing or the internal diameter of the nasal prongs making a direct comparison difficult. While there are differences between the studies at each flow rate, the overall trends remain similar. Direct comparisons between inhaled dose are difficult due to several factors influencing the drug available for inhalation, such as the position of components in the ventilator circuit, simulated breathing settings and humidification affect the inhaled dose [37,38,39]. Golshahi et al. [40] reported that increasing the tubing length from 20 cm to 50 cm increased the deposition fraction in the tube from 1.2% to 13.3%; this compared with a tube of length 1.8 m used in the current study.",

            "text": "In this study, a vibrating mesh nebuliser was used to generate the medical aerosol, previous work reported that with aerosol generated from VMN has a MMAD of 4 \u00b5m [28]. However, the observed averaged MMAD of the fugitive emissions ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 \u00b5m across all scenarios. The aerosol released into the environment was considerably smaller than originally generated by the nebuliser. The larger sized aerosol, in combination with the air flow, experiences greater inertia that can increase the rate of impaction and deposition of the larger sized aerosol within the system and upon the head model. The consequence of this is that the fugitively emitted aerosol is dominated by a lower sized fraction of aerosol, decreasing the MMAD. Bhashyam et al. [11] reported the volume median diameter of aerosol in a nasal cannula aerosol delivery system using a 3 L/min driving flow. The aerosol exiting the nebuliser was 5.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcm, which reduced to 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcm from an adult cannula and 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm from a paediatric cannula. Although higher gas-flow rates were used in the current study, similar trends were found with a decrease in the size fraction and the size leaving the patient interface. Berlinski [34] reported that the aerosol size fraction exiting the tip of the tracheostomy tube was 1.20 to 1.77 \u00b5m. Berlinski [33] reported that aerosol changed its characteristics when travelling through a tracheostomy tube; the effects were more noticeable for nebulised aerosol than metered dose inhalers or valved aerosol reservoirs. Additionally, during simulated adult breathing with gas-flow rates of 10, 40 and 60 L/min, there were comparable trends between the nasal cannula and the tracheostomy interface. This could indicate that the size distributions of fugitive emissions are independent of the patient interface and are governed instead by the flow velocities in these scenarios. The size fraction of the released aerosol has implications, as the aerosol can remain airborne for longer periods, which has been linked to secondary inhalation exposure [41].",

Studies have reported that the characteristics of the paediatric setup reduced the aerosol exiting the cannula during high-flow therapies [13,47].

To date, only limited studies exist that have examined fugitive emissions, once released into the surroundings. No studies have previously quantified time-series aerosol concentrations and the size distribution of fugitive emissions from high-flow therapy. Potential inhalation exposure to fugitive emissions during high-flow aerosol therapy was examined using adult and paediatric scenarios for both nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces. This study confirmed the release of fugitive emissions into the environment during aerosol high-flow treatment. The results showed that variations in interface type, patient (adult or paediatric) and gas-flow rates all impacted the quantity and characteristics of fugitive emissions. The highest aerosol concentration of 0.370 \u00b1 0.046 mg m\u22123 was recorded from the paediatric tracheostomy with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min, which also corresponded to the second highest inhaled dose across all the scenarios. It was observed that as the gas-flow rate increased, the inhaled dose decreased, and the fugitive emissions decreased. Overall, the results can be used to develop approaches for healthcare providers and patients to inform best practice to mitigate the risks of fugitive emissions in clinical practice.",
