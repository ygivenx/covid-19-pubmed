In the past 20 years, emerging and re-emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses, pandemic 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1), Zika virus, and enteroviruses have posed significant global public health threats2\u20138. Rapid and effective control of these epidemics at their onset was often not possible due to the long time lag required for the development of specific antivirals or vaccines. Early empirical administration of a highly effective broad-spectrum antiviral would improve patients\u2019 outcome and facilitate the control of these epidemics if given before or soon after the exact pathogen is identified. Current strategies for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents mainly focus on two aspects, virus encoded targets, and host defense factors or cellular machineries that are exploited by viruses9. Successful examples of virus-targeting strategy include blockers of viral attachment and fusion10,11, as well as inhibitors targeting viral enzymes, such as protease, polymerase, and neuraminidase, or internal structural proteins12. On the other aspect, type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-induced proteins can be used to trigger the cellular machineries of host defense to suppress viral replication. Nevertheless, challenges of drug toxicity and emergence of resistant viral progenies remain to be addressed.",

A key component in such reprogramming is the rapid up-regulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways, which can substantially impact on the viral replication process. Lipids have been recognized as structural elements of viral and cellular membranes. Viruses induce the formation of novel cytoplasmic membrane structures and compartments, in which viral genome replication and assembly occurs with perhaps shielding from host innate immune response. The involvement of lipids in the viral replication cycle is shared by enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, as well as both DNA and RNA viruses13. The correlation between virus infection and host lipid metabolism has been implicated in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)14. Infection with HCMV markedly upregulated flux through much of the central carbon metabolism particularly in flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its efflux to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.",

Thus, the modulation of cellular lipid metabolism to interfere with virus multiplication may be an appealing, broadly applicable approach for antiviral therapy. To this end, we carry out a pharmacological screening of a lipid library. AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-\u03b1 agonist, demonstrates potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activities in vitro and in vivo. Using AM580 as a tool compound, we modify it by click chemistry and identify the host cell sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) as the direct binding target of AM580. SREBPs are bHLH-zip transcription factors that have well-defined roles in the regulation of cellular lipid homeostasis. In mammals, there are two SREBP genes that express three SREBP proteins. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are produced via alternative transcriptional start sites on Srebf1, whereas the Srebf2 gene encodes SREBP2. Canonical SREBP1c signaling preferentially drives expression of fatty acid biosynthesis genes whereas SREBP2 predominately transactivates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular lipid movement and lipoprotein import15. Mechanistically, we find that AM580 blocks the interaction of SREBP1/2 proteins with the non-palindromic sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter/enhancer regions of multiple lipogenic genes, which inhibits their transcription and thus reverses the virus-induced lipid hyper-biosynthesis. Collectively, our study identifies SREBP-mediated lipid biosynthesis with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as an undescribed target for the development of broad-spectrum intervention strategies, especially for tackling novel viruses causing emerging infectious diseases.",

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed to explore multiple aspects of virus\u2013host interaction, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human diseases, organismal systems, and metabolism (Fig. 1a). Within the major category of metabolism, there is a combinational GO item with many global and overview maps that comprise sub-items such as carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biosynthesis of amino acids16. Notably, lipid metabolism was the top-ranking affected metabolic pathway, highlighting the importance of lipids among the metabolic changes triggered by MERS-CoV infection. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that steroid biosynthesis being the most highly enriched pathway, which indicated the markedly heightened lipid demands during MERS-CoV life cycle (Supplementary Figure 1a). To explore how MERS-CoV infection perturbed lipid metabolism, an untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed in MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells. Lipid features significantly changed with p < 0.05 (Student\u2019s t-test) in MERS-CoV-infected cells were selected. For better demonstration of changed lipids profile trend after MERS-CoV infection, a Heatmap was constructed according to the identified lipid list (Supplementary Data 1). As shown in Fig. 1b, these changed lipid features include glycerophospholipid and fatty acids classes, indicating that MERS-CoV infection strongly perturbed lipid homeostasis. To map the landscape of metabolic-transcriptional alterations in the context of virus infection, we performed an integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis to simultaneously map genes and lipid metabolites in different pathways. As shown in Fig. 1c, integrative network modeling specifically revealed that the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was most dramatically modulated by MERS-CoV infection. Collectively, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection triggered marked host lipid metabolic changes.",

Colorimetric assays reflecting cell viability were performed to select compounds that inhibited the cytopathic effects (CPE) that develop upon virus infection (Fig. 1d). Screening conditions were optimized, in which at 0.1 MOI and 24 h post-MERS-CoV infection and at 0.01 MOI and 48 h post-H1N1 infection were chosen, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1b, c). A lipid metabolite with anti-inflammatory effects, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, protected Huh7 cells against MERS-CoV infection, while the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist FICZ and apoptosis regulatory messenger C16 Ceramide protected MDCK cells against H1N1 infection. Notably, AM580, a synthetic agonist, exhibited cell protection against both viruses and was selected for further investigations (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, (R)-methandamide, an agonist of cannabinoid receptor that functionally increased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes17, facilitated virus replication at non-toxic concentrations, thus caused more severe CPE than that of the virus control. These findings indicated that modulation of host lipid metabolism could significantly change the outcome of virus infection, thus corroborate with our hypothesis of modulating virus-induced lipid reprogramming for therapeutic intervention.",

Using MERS-CoV infection as a model, we characterized the antiviral activity of AM580 in cell cultures. First, a multi-cycle virus growth assay was performed to plot the virus replication kinetics with or without AM580. Strikingly, AM580 treatment reduced viral titers in the cell supernatant by >3-log10 when compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, and the infectious plaque-forming units (PFUs) in the AM580 group remained at baseline levels during the whole time-course (Fig. 2a). Expression of MERS-CoV nucleoprotein (NP) was dramatically decreased upon AM580 addition, especially at 9 h post-infection (hpi) and 1 MOI (Fig. 2b). Flow cytometry showed that the percentage of MERS-CoV-infected cells after AM580 treatment decreased from 65% (DMSO) to 5.38% (AM580) at 24 hpi (upper panel, Fig. 2c). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining for MERS-CoV NP suggested near-complete suppression of virus infection upon AM580 treatment (lower panel, Fig. 2c). AM580 also significantly reduced MERS-CoV replication in multiple cell types, including lung (A549 and Calu-3), kidney (Vero), and immune cells [THP-1 and human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)] (Fig. 2d) as well as human primary small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC) (Fig. 2e). Moreover, AM580 suppressed virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine activation in Huh7 cells and MDMs (Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, AM580 showed potent anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell cultures with significant inhibition of virus replication, cell protection, and anti-inflammatory responses.",

Previous pharmacokinetics study revealed that AM580 has a relatively large apparent volume of distribution (1.1\u20131.5/kg) and small clearance (8.8\u20139.7 ml/min/kg), with pharmacokinetic behavior linear within the dose range from 2 to 10 mg/kg after intraperitoneal injection19. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of the maximal amount of AM580 soluble in PBS (12.5 mg/kg) for 7 days resulted in no signs of toxicity (Supplementary Figure 2b). In mice challenged with 50 PFU of MERS-CoV, all 20/20 mice (100%) survived after they received 3 days of i.p. injection of AM580, whereas 14/20 DMSO-treated mice died (survival rate 30%; Fig. 3a). Mice in the AM580-treated group exhibited significantly less body weight loss (p < 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test) than that of the DMSO-treated group on days 4 and 5 post-infection (Fig. 3b), and with lower lung tissue virus titers and viral loads (p < 0.01, Student\u2019s t-test) at days 2 and 4 (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figure 7e). On day 4 post-challenge, the viral RNA load in brain tissues of the AM580-treated mice was undetectable and was 4-log10 lower than that of the DMSO-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7e). Histopathologic examination showed that alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissues of the AM580-treated mice were substantially diminished compared to the control mice (Fig. 3d). Collectively, these results demonstrated that AM580 effectively protected hDPP4-transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge by inhibiting MERS-CoV replication and virus-associated pneumonia and encephalitis in vivo.",

Using AM580 as a tool compound, we try to decipher the key components of lipid metabolism that exhibited broad relevance to human viral infections. First, we used an immunofluorescence test to visualize the distribution patterns of cellular lipid droplets (LDs) and cholesterol in the presence or absence of AM580 in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells, which are liver cells highly active in lipid metabolism. Infection by MERS-CoV markedly enhanced the accumulation of LDs and cholesterol, whereas addition of AM580 significantly reduced their accumulation (Fig. 4a). To validate this observation, mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in the lipid biosynthesis pathways were investigated. Significant decreases in mRNA expression were detected in 13/17 (76.5%) genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (upper panel, Fig. 4b) and 10/12 (83.3%) genes in cholesterol synthesis pathways (lower panel, Fig. 4b) in AM580-treated infected cells, when compared with those of the DMSO-treated infected controls. Moreover, the profound increase of the major lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS) associated with MERS-CoV infection indicated that the virus rapidly upregulated lipid biosynthesis, while AM580 might antagonize these changes, thereby reducing virus replication.",

To evaluate the role of SREBPs on MERS-CoV replication, we compared the growth of MERS-CoV in wild-type control cells (mock) and SREBP gene silencing or hyper-expression cells. Notably, transfection of SREBP1- or SREBP2-targeted siRNAs diminished the precursor SREBPs (pre-SREBPs) production, which significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 4c). Though the expression level of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in double knockdown is not more reduced than that of the individual knockdown because only 50% the amount of siRNA for each SREBP was applied, the double knockdown of both SREBPs resulted in about 2 log10 (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) decrease of infectious virus particle when compared with the 1 log10 reduction of individual knockdown, which indicated a potential synergistic effects when both activities of SREBP1 and SREBP2 were inhibited. Together, this result indicated that SREBPs were essential for MERS-CoV replication. Transactivation of lipid biosynthesis genes requires cleavage of pre-SREBPs to release their N-terminal nuclear forms (n-SREBPs), a process which is regulated by sterols22. Overexpression of either n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2, however, diminished the antiviral potency of AM580 by about 1.5-log10 upon MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4d). Together, these results indicated a pro-viral role of n-SREBPs in MERS-CoV replication and an inhibitory role of AM580 on n-SREBPs\u2019 activity.",

Inhibition of both genes transactivation, as shown in Fig. 4e, led us to suspect that AM580 functions to interrupt the interaction of n-SREBPs with the SREs that are conserved in lipogenic promoters including FAS, ACC, HMGCS, etc. To this end, SREBP1/2 transcription factor assays were performed, in which specific double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences containing the n-SREBP1- or n-SREBP2-binding SREs were immobilized in the solid phase. Binding intensity of nuclear-extracted n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2 was then detected in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Notably, AM580 inhibited the binding of both n-SREBP1 (Fig. 5a) and n-SREBP2 (Supplementary Figure 5a) with their corresponding SREs, whereas the compounds FICZ and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 did not (Supplementary Figure 7m). To determine whether AM580 targets n-SREBPs or SREs, we pre-incubated AM580 with either immobilized SRE-dsDNA before adding n-SREBPs or with n-SREBPs before binding with SRE-dsDNA. Taking n-SREBP1 as an example, AM580 was found to bind with n-SREBP1 and not SRE-dsDNA, and inhibited the SRE-dsDNA binding activity of n-SREBP1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5b).",

Taking n-SREBP1 as an example, AM580 binds to the E-box site through four amino acids (His328, Glu332, Tyr335, and Arg336) that are highly conserved among helix\u2013loop\u2013helix proteins (Supplementary Figure 5b). The major interaction was predicted to be between AM580 and residue Tyr335 by a hydrogen bond. Importantly, the Tyr335 that determines SRE recognition24 is completely conserved between human and mouse SREBPs (lower panel, Fig. 5c), which may explain the conservation of the broad spectrum antiviral property of AM580 in human cells and in mouse models.",

An AM580-derived probe with biotin and photo-affinity tags (AM580dp) was synthesized to facilitate the evaluation of its binding characteristics. The AM580dp was made by introducing a linker arm containing an azido end to the carboxylic acid group on AM580, yielding the azido-AM580, which was designed for further addition of a tri-functional linker with UV photo-affinity and biotin tags with specific probing functionalities (Fig. 5d). Like AM580, azido-AM580 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in Huh7 and Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 5c). Next, using an azido-reactive green fluorescent dye for localization, azido-AM580 was found largely in the host cell nucleus, which corroborated our hypothesis that AM580 may target a lipogenic transactivation event (Fig. 5e). To capture the binding target, AM580dp was immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated agarose by its biotin group and incubated with transfected cell lysates expressing WT or Y335R n-SREBP1. RAR-\u03b1, a known AM580 receptor, was co-transfected as a control. After ultraviolet irradiation to activate the crosslinking photo-affinity tag in AM580dp, the protein-AM580dp complex was fixed and isolated. As shown in Fig. 5f, almost equal amounts of RAR-\u03b1 were precipitated by AM580dp in both WT or mutant Y335R n-SREBP1 groups, indicating that AM580dp was biologically functional. However, significantly more WT n-SREBP1 was detected than Y335R n-SREBP1, suggesting a stronger binding affinity between AM580 and WT n-SREBP1 than that of Y335R n-SREBP1. In addition, SRE binding activity of n-SREBP1 was significantly (p < 0.01, Student\u2019s t-test) diminished when Tyr335 was substituted with arginine, which highlighted the crucial role of Tyr335 in SRE recognition (Supplementary Figure 5d). Taken together, we concluded that AM580 disrupted n-SREBP1 and SRE binding, specifically via impairing the SRE-recognition functionality of n-SREBP1.",

To elucidate these downstream consequences, we investigated one of the SREBP-mediated pathways, fatty acid synthesis. First, we explored the ability of an end-product of the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, sodium palmitate, to reverse the antiviral activity of AM580. Notably, both C75 (a FAS inhibitor specific for fatty acid biosynthesis pathway) and AM580 showed anti-MERS-CoV activity (Fig. 6a). Addition of sodium palmitate did not affect the virus yield in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with DMSO, but increased the virus yield (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with either AM580 or C75 (Fig. 6a). This finding suggested that MERS-CoV replication hijacked host fatty acid synthesis, which can be inhibited through shut-down of lipogenic transactivation while rescued by exogenous palmitate. Next, we explored whether fatty acid synthesis was critically involved in the replication of other AM580-inhibited viruses. To this end, replication rescue assays using H1N1 (negative-strand RNA virus representative), EV-A71 (non-enveloped RNA virus representative), and AdV5 (DNA virus representative) were performed (Fig. 6b, d). Indeed, significant (p < 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test) extents of rescue were achieved for these viruses and especially H1N1 virus (p < 0.01, Student\u2019s t-test) with addition of sodium palmitate.",

Palmitoylation, a downstream consequence of fatty acid synthesis, is a post-translational modification that modulates protein function and protein localization. In the context of influenza A viruses, the best characterized palmitoylated protein is the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA)27. Therefore, we explored whether blockade of fatty acid synthesis would impede influenza HA palmitoylation and inhibit H1N1 replication. HA-overexpressed A549 cells were cultured with AM580 or vehicle (DMSO) or the positive control inhibitor 2-BP, which is specific against protein palmitoylation28. Palmitoylated HA protein was purified via resin-assisted capture. Strikingly, reduced levels of palmitoylated HA were observed with the addition of 2-BP (56%) and AM580 (69%) when compared with DMSO (100%) controls (Fig. 6f). Moreover, 2-BP also showed inhibition against MERS-CoV and H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 4b). To examine the specificity, oleic acid, a downstream metabolite of palmitate was also used in the complementation assays. The result showed that additional oleic acid (100 \u00b5M) could not rescue the influenza A H1N1 virus replication but indeed complement the viral growth of MERS-CoV, ZIKV, and AdV5 (Fig. 6a, c, d). This finding suggested that the palmitoylation of the viral HA was the main target of influenza A H1N1 virus inhibition by AM580. Overall, using DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation as two important downstream consequences of SREBPs-dependent pathways, we demonstrated that the suppression of SREBPs-dependent lipogenic transactivation reduced viral propagation fitness by intervening the downstream fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.",

Previous studies on the viral perturbation of host lipid metabolism have not been able to identify the underlying mechanism and host factors targeted by the invading virus. The remarkable in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy of the tool compound AM580, through the inhibition of SREBP-related pathways, confirms that up-regulation of host lipid biosynthesis is crucial in multiple aspects of viral life cycle and suggests that these aspects are vulnerable to antiviral intervention. SREBPs-mediated lipogenesis, affecting the building of membrane blocks, energy supply, and post-translational protein modification, is a complex process with cross talks and compensatory mechanisms that influence propagation of diverse groups of viruses (Fig. 7). Despite such complexities, DNA-binding activity of n-SREBPs is a potentially important target for therapeutic intervention against a broad spectrum of pathogenic viruses.",

Indeed, both betulin and a pre-SREBPs cleavage inhibitor PF 429242 exhibited some inhibitory effect on MERS-CoV replication at non-toxic concentrations (Supplementary Figure 4a). 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol metabolite inhibiting infection by a broad range of pathogenic viruses, works indirectly through a 25HC sensor protein to elicit SCAP-Insig binding29,30. While AM580 acts differently from the above inhibitors, these studies supports that proteolytic processing of SREBPs may also be a feasible target for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Similar to these studies, the use of cancer cell lines which usually underwent complex genetic and metabolic rearrangement may affect the interpretation of results31. In addition, usage of odd carbon chain glycerophospholipid internal standards such as PC (12:0/13:0), PE (17:0/17:0)), PG (17:0/17:0), and addition of such standards directly to biological samples before lipid extraction would be more equitable and be used in the future lipidomic sample preparation32.",

            "text": "The importance of SREBP regulatory pathway has been implicated in the life cycle of hantavirus which is dependent on lipid synthesis for virus entry and membrane fusion process33,34. This is also exemplified by the pharmacological inhibition of FAS by C75 or Cerulenin that impaired the replication of a broad-spectrum of viruses. Specifically, HCMV and influenza A virus infections may require fatty acid synthesis to modulate membrane composition for viral budding or protein modifications35. Direct inhibition of FAS reduces infectivity of respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus serotype 16 by changing the membrane components of the virion progeny particles. DENV NS3 recruits FAS to sites of replication and stimulates fatty acid synthesis36. Distinct from those studies, our work underscores the indispensability of SREBP-mediated fatty acid synthesis to multiple post-virus-entry events, particularly for the emerging infectious viruses such as MERS-CoV and Influenza A virus. As examples, reduced DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation are two important consequences of SREBP-controlled fatty acid synthesis inhibition (Fig. 6e, g). Studies on other viral replication processes related to SREBP-mediated downstream pathways are warranted. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of diverse viruses, including enveloped (MERS-CoV, H1N1) and non-enveloped (EV-A71) RNA, and DNA (AdV5) viruses, could be partially rescued by exogenously supplied palmitate and to different extents (Fig. 6a, d). These results also support the requirement of de novo fatty acid synthesis for optimal viral replication. Moreover, transcriptional inactivation of lipogenic enzymes, in addition to FAS, may impair virus replication through diverse pathways in virus-specific manners (Fig. 7).",

            "text": "An unexpected result of the study is that antiviral activity of AM580 is neither dependent on the RAR-\u03b1 pathway (Supplementary Figure 6a\u2013c), nor on the activation of host innate immune response (Supplementary Figure 6d, e). Possible \u201coff-target\u201d effects of AM580 leading to its broad antiviral activity cannot be excluded as the compound was long known to be an RAR-\u03b1 agonist. Moreover, a small-molecule compound can be a multi-target binder due to its intrinsic structural features, while the elicited biological responses through one of the ligand-target interactions found presently may not necessarily account for the observed antiviral activity. Although teratogenic effects of AM580, as a pro-differentiation agonist and not a cytotoxic, have been reported in mouse models37, the anticipated therapeutic benefits outweigh its side effect when considering the short duration of 3-day treatment by AM580 in the animal experiments. In exploring AM580 analogs with comparable potency and improved bioavailability, tamibarotene38, an orally active retinoid for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia was identified (Supplementary Table 1). Tamibarotene has a known safety profile and is marketed in Japan. With the clinical experience of tamibarotene, we believe AM580-related compounds could be modified as a safe and broad group of antiviral therapeutic compounds. Overall, by targeting the SREBP-associated lipid biosynthetic pathways, we demonstrate that the lipidomic reprogramming of host cells by various viruses exposes vulnerable targets for therapeutic intervention.",

To synthesize azido-AM580, 20 mg of AM580 was mixed with 3.14 ml of azido-PEG5-amine (10 mg/ml) dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF). Next, 40 mg of 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate, 50 \u03bcl of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), and 2.46 ml of dichloromethane were added to a final volume 5.7 ml. Reactions were performed at room temperature with shaking. After overnight incubation, the reaction mixture was lyophilized to remove solvent. Azido-AM580 was purified by HPLC and m/z 640 was detected by mass spectrometry (MS). Final yield was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To synthesize AM580dp, the purified azido-AM580 was linked with an amine reactive tri-functional crosslinker (2-[N2-[N\u03b1-Benzoylbenzoicamido-N6-6-biotinamidocaproyl]lysinylamido]ethyl-2\u2032-(N sulfosuccinimidylcarboxy)ethyl disulfide sodium salt (Santa Cruz), which was a biotin-UV activating-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester compound. This tri-functional crosslinker contains a NHS-ester head group for linking to the amine tail of another crosslinker phosphine compound methyl 4-[2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]ethylcarbamoyl]-2-diphenylphosphanyl-benzoate (Shinsei Chemical Company Ltd), a biotin head group for Streptavidin binding on the other end, and a UV activating benzophenone group for crosslinking with target binding proteins of AM580. Specifically, 1 mg of tri-functional linker compound was mixed with 30 \u03bcl of 74.8 mM crosslinker phosphine compound (dissolved in DMSO-d6) to a final volume of 1 ml by DMF. The molar ratio of these compounds was 1:2. The reaction was performed at 40 \u00b0C with shaking at 1400 rpm. Excess azido-AM580 was added to this mixture to allow crosslinking with the phosphine group by Staudinger ligation reaction. The reaction product was then incubated with Streptavidin agarose resin (Pierce) to capture the AM580dp product.",
