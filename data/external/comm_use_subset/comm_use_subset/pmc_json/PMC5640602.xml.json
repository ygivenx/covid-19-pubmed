The thick epithelial mucus layer has a barrier function that is attributed to its high viscosity and protects the mucosal epithelium from gastric acid, digestive juice, and pathogens19,20. We investigated the mechanism by which the virus or viral RNA is present in faeces, and suggested that mucus (such as sputum or nasal discharge) protects virus or viral RNA from the effects of acid and digestive juices21. Based on these findings, we made the following hypothesis. We hypothesized that mucus can protect pathogens against alcohol-based disinfectants, as mucus plays an important role in protection from gastric acid and digestive juice in the human gastrointestinal tract.",

Current hand hygiene guidelines recommend washing with water as the first choice for removing visible contamination6,7. However, fine sprays of sputum or nasal fluids on hands often go unnoticed and may contain infectious substances. In this study, such sprays were mimicked in inactivation tests using small amounts (15\u201330 \u00b5l) of pathogen-containing mucus. Since such sprays may acquire the resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, hand washing that washes out mucus physically remains the preferred practice for good hand hygiene. Disinfectant methods such as UV that do not require diffusion throughout the entire target to be effective are able to inactivate pathogens in viscous liquids.

            "text": "A limitation of this study was that the influence of contaminants in sputum samples was not evaluated, although the viscosity of the sputum samples was measured. Contaminants in sputum samples may reduce the effects of alcohol-based disinfectants. However, because the titre ratio/viable count ratio were almost equivalent under various artificial mucus conditions and sputum conditions, we suggest that the influence of contaminants was small and that viscosity was the important factor in pathogen protection. Furthermore, when alcohol-based disinfectant is added to pathogen/artificial mucus and incubated, it is difficult to normalise the conditions of admixture with alcohols, which results in low reproducibility. In other words, because of the instability of convection (mixing) conditions, the inactivation/sterilization reaction may not be stable. In this study, the inactivation/sterilization reaction was stable and reproducibility was maintained because a single experimenter conducted the experiments using a similar procedure. Although our conclusion that the titre ratio/viable count ratio increased as the viscosity increased remains valid, other groups may obtain slightly different results when repeating these experiments.",
