The M2 channel protein, which is a pH-sensitive proton channel, also plays a key role in virus replication and regulates virus morphology [2,3]. The two adamantane derivative-based drugs amantadine and rimantadine (Figure 1), which have been used as the first-choice antiviral drugs against community outbreaks, were the first antivirals licensed for effective against influenza A viruses [4]. However, since 2003, the frequency of amantadine resistance has increased significantly, from less than 5% to greater than 90% of isolated influenza A virus [5]. There is therefore a great urgent need to discover new types of M2 inhibitors for the development of new anti-in\ufb02uenza drugs due to the new mutations on M2 channel protein and the drug-resistance of amantadine and rimantadine [6]. The new drugs directed against M2 channel proteins should be more universal and effective than the previous ones.",

            "text": "Why have amantadine and rimantadine become resistant to influenza A virus recently? Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to investigate the amantadine resistance in the trans-membrane domain of the M2 channel protein [7,8]. According to statistical data on resistant mutants, 70% to 80% of substitutions occur at position Ser31, and around 10% occur at positions Val27 and Ala30 in vitro and in clinical samples [7]. To solve the drug-resistance problem, a reliable molecular structure of M2 channel protein is a high priority for designing new drugs [10]. The M2 channel protein structures obtained experimentally in previous studies [11,12,13] have thus become the main targets for scientists and pharmacologists to find drugs against influenza A virus using structure-based drug design approaches [9,10]. One of them is the high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy structure by Schnell and Chou with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) code entry of 2RLF [14] that has successfully provided a full-length structure of H3N2 M2 channel protein. The 3D 2009-H1N1 M2 channel protein [15] built from sequence with the Genbank accession number of GQ385303 was also used in this current research.",

Consequently, the scaffold was based on the adamantyl group and selection of suitable functional groups attaching to the scaffold to form new compounds that will potentially bind well to M2 channel proteins at the key residues in the binding site [27]. Prior to molecular docking simulation, all 200 new potential M2 inhibitors were built using Gaussview 4.1 software [28].

AutoDock Tools version 1.5.4 [30] was used to add polar hydrogens, assign Kollman charges and create grid binding boxes. The volume of each grid box was 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30, with the default 0.375 \u00c5 spacing. For each type of M2 channel protein structures, AutoGrid version 3.05 was used to create af\ufb01nity grids which centered at the active sites. Based on the coexistence of two possible binding positions and two existing M2 channel proteins [20], docking inhibitors into M2 channel will be separated into four categories: (1) docking inside the H3N2 M2 channel protein; (2) docking inside the 2009-H1N1 M2 channel protein; (3) docking outside the H3N2 M2 channel protein; and (4) docking outside the 2009-H1N1 M2 channel protein. The positive control for docking was obtained by re-docking amantadine and rimantadine extracted from the NMR structure [14] to locate the binding site on M2 channel protein before docking for 200 ligands. The binding box inside M2 channel proteins was positioned to encompass all three possible binding sites, namely Ala30, Ser31 and Gly34 and the binding box outside M2 channel proteins was set up to cover two important functional residues: channel gate Trp41 and channel lock Asp44 [15]. The binding affinities were calculated by AutoGrid version 3.05 using the following atom types: aromatic carbon (A), carbon (C), fluorine (F), iodine (I), nitrogen (N), hydrogen bond accepting N (NA), oxygen (O), hydrogen bond accepting O (OA), sulfur (S), hydrogen bond accepting (SA), silicon (Si), hydrogen (H) and electrostatic (e) [30]. The ligand set includes 200 new M2 inhibitors created from previously published studies and the others were newly created by modifying or adding more functional groups to the adamantane scaffold. AutoDockTools 1.5.4 was also used to merge nonpolar hydrogens, add charges and visually set up rotatable bonds for each ligand via AutoTors.",

In this work, the training set molecule was selected from two different groups: the top 10 compounds binding inside the M2 channel proteins and the top 10 compounds binding outside the M2 channel proteins. The bond orders of these inhibitors were checked and verified before the generation of a pharmacophore model. The conformational flexibility of selected ligands was accomodated by creating multiple conformers to cover all representatives over a specified energy threshold. The HipHop module of Discovery Studio 2.5 software was employed to build a plausible binding hypothesis and identify a set of chemical features common to the most potent training molecule structures [36]. The general chemical features that considered in this training set were hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (HBDs and HBAs), and aliphatic hydrophobes. Eighteen hypotheses were generated in the outside group and seventeen hypotheses were created in the inside group, and the best hypothesis from each group was selected based on the high number of compounds fitting it as well as the high fit value of the hypothesis.",

            "text": "In this study the top highly potent anti-in\ufb02uenza A compounds from among 200 new compounds based on the amantadine scaffold were identified by a combination of different computational methodologies. The results also confirmed that the binding inside position was more favourable and stable than binding outside the M2 channel proteins. The results obtained based on virtual screening revealed that the top 10 compounds binding at both positions inside and outside the channel have higher binding affinity to both H3N2 and 2009-H1N1 M2 channel proteins than amantadine and rimantadine. Detailed pharmacophore analysis for the top hits among the M2 channel inhibitors also revealed the nature of interactions between functional groups of the top binding candidates with the M2 channel proteins. From this study, two compounds, I5 and I9, were predicted to be the most active inhibitors against both in\ufb02uenza A virus strains H3N2 and 2009-H1N1. However, due to the limitations of the method employed, such findings and additional mutation of M2 channel protein studies would require more accurate calculations to be confirmed. Molecular dynamics simulation should be done in the future to capture the flexible interactions between ligand-M2 channel proteins, together with in vitro and in vivo studies on the top binding compounds.",
