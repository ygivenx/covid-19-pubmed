One framework would guide data standardization, sharing, access and use, including rules on the transfer of agreed data sets into common repositories for curation. Another framework would facilitate cataloguing of biomaterials collected during an outbreak and would establish transparent rules for their management, thereby creating a virtual biobank. For future emergencies, a biobank framework will also need to encompass ethics guidelines for the collection and use of samples, including the provision of appropriate information to patients. ",
