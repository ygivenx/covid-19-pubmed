By contrast, in other regions, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, protection was only 46.1% [4]. Globally approved vaccines include either live attenuated (Rotarix, RV1; GlaxoSmithKline Inc., Rixensart, Belgium) or reassortant RV strains (RotaTeq, RV5; Merck and Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). Hence, both vaccines are based on replicating viral strains and are thus not safe by nature. A case report from 2010 described the RV transmission from a RotaTeq vaccinated child to its unvaccinated sibling. This vaccine associated infection resulted in gastroenteritis that required emergency care. The transmitted RV strain was a reassorted vaccine-derived strain. Reassortment may have resulted in the recovery of virulence [5]. In addition, both RV vaccines were found to be associated with a slightly increased risk of intussusception after the primary vaccination [6]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient and in particular safer vaccines. Here, we present our findings on an alternative vaccine approach that ultimately aims to protect children from RV infection-associated symptoms in their early time of life.",

For the attachment to the host cell, the capsids also contain VP4 spikes that protrude through VP7 pores and attach to the VP6 layer. To produce VLPs of RV, many expression vectors exist and several vaccine candidates have been proven to be effective against RV induced diarrhea or virus shedding in small animal models. Triple-layered VLPs containing VP2, VP6 and VP7 [9,10] or double-layered VLPs consisting of VP2 and VP6 are examples of this approach [11]. Moreover, subunit vaccines produced of VP6 in eukaryotic cells [12,13] or VP2 and VP6 expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli and assembled into VLPs [14] showed protection against RV induced disease. However, the assembly of RV structural proteins into rotavirus like particles (RVLPs) requires the simultaneous expression of several recombinant RV genes in a single cell followed by multiple purification steps of these RVLPs. These are challenging steps in the production of a stable, mass-produced vaccine.",

We used the herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) amplicon vector to deliver a DNA cassette with a single polycistronic messenger RNA which contains the coding sequences of the three capsid proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7, separated by internal ribosome entry sites for the production of the RVLPs. The HSV-1 amplicon vector system with its high transgenic capacity of up to 150 kb is safe as the transgenes are unable to replicate [15], but allow delivery of synthetic DNA encoding any antigen of interest [16]. With this system, the time consuming and complex purification of VLPs is not required. Herpes simplex virus type-1 amplicon vector transduction triggering RVLP production was shown in previous studies from our laboratory but VP2 and VP7 were dramatically underrepresented compared to VP6 [17].",

An important goal of structural vaccinology is the conformational stabilization of an antigen based on its native three-dimensional structure to induce an efficacious immune response. Based on these principles, we aimed to increase the amounts of VLP-generating and immunizing proteins synthesized in situ, we chose to alter the sequence of viral genes in the amplicon vector and optimized the amino acid sequence to the codon usage of human cells.",

Notably, the number of placental layers between mothers and their fetuses is different for various mammals, which affects or inhibits the ability to transfer antibodies during pregnancy. The mammals cluster into three groups, with humans belonging to group 1, where, due to their single layer placenta type, the major amount of immunoglobulin is transferred to the fetus prior to parturition [21]. In group 2, with mice and dogs as examples, the immunoglobulins are transferred both through the placental and the lactogenic pathway. The efficiency by which different isotypes of antibodies are transferred to the milk differs between the individual species. Although being aware of these differences, it was of interest to observe the general potency of our vaccine type in a mouse model. We thus studied the kinetics of anti-RV antibody production in the sera of mice as well as in their milk. Moreover, we tested for prepartum antibody transfer compared to the postpartum transfer by milk. Finally, we also tested the protective effect of passive antibody transfer in the context of a challenge infection.",

Through optimization of the codon usage, the codon adaption index (CAI) increased from 0.605 to 0.895 for human and from 0.606 to 0.892 for mouse. Indeed, the codon-optimized vector sWa[VP2/6/7] induced an enhanced protein synthesis in human cells over the non-codon-optimized vector RRV[VP7/6/2] (Figure 1C, left panel). This effect was not observed in the murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 (Figure 1C, right panel) even though the CAIs for the codon usage of humans and mice were very similar.",

Blood and milk samples from dams were collected after parturition and tested for RV specific IgG antibodies using a RV (strain Wa) specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The data used to generate the plot in 3B as well as the number of animals included in this study and p-values are provided in the Appendix A as Table A1. Mice immunized with sWa[VP2/6/7] showed a relative RV-specific IgG (rIgG) level of 54.85% at day 10 post-booster immunization (dpb), which decreased to 37.89% rIgG at 14 dpb and then decreased to 23.78% rIgG at 20 dpb.

Based on the results from the immune fluorescence analysis of the mice sera, we were able to raise VP2- and VP6-specific antibodies in the blood of sWa[VP2/6/7] vaccinated dams, but no VP7-specific antibodies. The use of HSV-1 amplicon vectors to launch the in situ production of RVLPs provides the advantage that as opposed to injection of purified VLPs, the delivery of VLP encoding genes into host cells results in the intracellular production of antigens. In our case, we expected the formation of triple-layered RVLPs. Therefore, we further characterized the nature of our antigen used for vaccination. In a first step, RVLPs formed upon transduction of sWa[VP2/6/7] gene expression cassettes was analyzed using electron microscopy (Figure 5A,B) and in a second step, the composition of purified particles was examined using Western blot analysis (Figure 5C). Negative staining transmission electron microscopy of the purified cell lysates from sWa[VP2/6/7] transduced cells showed that the synthesized RV structural proteins assembled into RVLPs similar in size and structure to wild-type RV particles [28]. Further immunogold labeling of these RVLPs using the rabbit polyclonal anti-RV serum and a secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles confirmed the VLP\u2019s identity as RV-like.",

We solved this problem by using a synthetic and codon-optimized DNA cassette, which maintained the original (RV strain Wa, Dhaka isolate) amino acid sequences of the three major capsid proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7. The particular strengths of this approach are three-fold: (1) the vaccine can easily be adjusted to the circulating RV strain, since only the packaged DNA sequence needs to be modified; (2) HSV-1 amplicon vectors have a high transgene capacity (up to 150 kb) that ensures that multiple copies of the RV protein encoding genes are delivered and thereby trigger a high amount of protein synthesis; and (3) VLP purification, which is very expensive and time consuming, can be omitted because VLPs are being formed in situ.",

We and others [14,17,27,31] reported that assembly of structural proteins into VLPs might be crucial for protection against RV infections. The viral structure is assembled by several proteins on the VLP surface mimicking the native virions and allowing crucial overlapping epitopes to be recognized by antibodies that would not be possible by the use of single individual subunits as antigens. Adopting these principles, we propose that the structural aspect of RVLPs is important for RV specific generation of protective antibodies. Based on electron microscopic analysis, the RVLPs produced in vitro were highly analogous to native RV particles. However, further analysis revealed that cell culture purified RVLPs were predominantly composed of VP2 and VP6 but excluded VP7 (Figure 5C). As known from literature [1,32], and shown by our data of the intracellular localization of the synthetized proteins (Figure 1D), VP7 associates with the membranes of the ER, whereas VP2 and VP6 form punctate structures within the cytoplasm but do not co-localize with the ER membranes. It is not fully understood how triple-layered particles (TLP) can form under these conditions. However, Coste et al. were able to purify TLPs following co-infection of insect cells with three different baculoviruses [27] (i.e., one for the expression of each of the three capsid proteins, VP2, VP6, and VP7).",

Instead, upon VLP purification, VP7 remained in the pellet, together with the cellular debris. Even more surprisingly, antibodies against VP7 were not induced under these circumstances. Consequently, it might be that the requirements for TLP formation are different for insect cells and mammalian cells. Indeed, according to others, co-expression of NSP4 and/or VP4 together with the three capsid proteins may play a pivotal role in the assembly of the third layer [1]. A better understanding of the RV assembly process is needed to solve the problem of VP7 incorporation into VLPs in the future.",

However, in all species, including humans and mice, RV infection in adults is usually asymptomatic and does not cause diarrhea. Similar to human babies and in contrast to adult humans and mice, newborn mice develop severe diarrhea upon RV infection, particularly during the first 14 days of their life [33]. However, the immune system of newborns is not fully mature at this stage. Thus, immunization of mothers, resulting in the protective transfer of their antibody repertoire to the offspring, represents an important alternative that can also be mimicked in the mouse model. Indeed, protection against RV diarrhea by passive maternal transfer of antibodies has been reported (mouse maternal antibody model) using live-rotavirus vaccines [34], recombinant adenovirus expressing VP7 [35], recombinant VP6 and VP8 proteins expressed in E. coli [36], VLPs assembled in insect cells [27] or capsid proteins VP2 and VP6 expressed in E. coli and assembled into VLPs post-purification [14].",

Coste et al. demonstrated that nasal immunization of mice with purified TLPs assembled in insect cells and comprising VP2, VP6, and VP7 triggered high milk and serum antibody titers.

[27], though with IgG and upon in situ synthesis of the viral proteins instead of immunizing with purified VLPs. Indeed, our vaccinated mice produced high anti RV IgG antibody titers, both in serum and in milk, and they transferred these antibodies to their offspring. However, we were unable to detect any RV specific IgA antibodies in the vaccinated mice. Consequently, a clear protection against diarrhea was not achieved. This was in agreement with previous studies [34,36], which reported that protection from rotavirus diarrhea relied on the lactogenic transfer of IgA against VP7 or VP4. Of course, several factors contribute to clinical protection against RV, including a close match of antibodies against the targeted antigens, the amount and isotype of antibodies as well as the location, where they should act. In the present case, the transfer of antibodies from the immunized mothers to their suckling mice seemed efficient. However, at least three factors might have influenced the protective outcome in a negative way: (1) The stringent stop criteria for the animal experiments did not allow the examination of the duration and severity of RV symptoms in offspring in the different experimental groups; (2) The antibody isotype generated upon vaccination was predominantly IgG, whereas IgA is supposed to provide a better level of protection, particularly in the gut. On the other hand, one may consider that the maternal antibodies had been recovered from the gut as a consequence of suckling milk containing these antibodies. Thus, the challenging virus and the potentially protective antibodies had opportunities to meet and to react in the gut, at least for a certain amount of time. It was, therefore, surprising to note that no obvious protective effect could be achieved. Of note, we used heterologous RVLPs based on the human RV strain Wa and mice were challenged with a heterotypic RV, the murine strain EDIM. Thus, it might be that even if VP7-specific antibodies were raised, no protection was observed because of the poor cross-reactivity between the raised antibodies; (3) According to Butler et al. [21], the mammals cluster into three groups, with respect to lactogenic immunity. Rodents, classified in group 2, show particularly good absorption of IgG from the gut, which drains the gut from functional antibodies. Humans, classified in group 1, absorb only little immunoglobulins from the gut, leaving the antibodies to work where they are supposed to throughout a RV infection. Pigs, classified in group 3, show extensive absorption of all classes of immunoglobulins but only for the first 12 h. Afterwards, the milk antibodies are known to work for several weeks particularly well in the porcine gut. This property is even enhanced by the ability of the pigs to produce high amounts of IgA in response to vaccination. ",

The codon adaption index [45] was calculated using The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) [46].

The attB flanked synthetic gene expression cassettes (sWaRV) encoding the RV proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7, separated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) either with or without stop codon at the 5\u2032 end were generated by Biomatik. The Gateway B/P recombination between the attB flanked sWaRV cassette and the attP containing donor vector pDONR221 led to two entry plasmids containing the sWaRV gene expression cassette flanked by attL sites either with (pE_sWaRV_STOP) or without stop codon (pE_sWaRV).

The HSV-1 amplicon vectors encoding single structural RV proteins have been generated as follows: The single RV genes were amplified using the synthetic gene expression cassettes (sWaRV) as the template. The resulting PCR product was inserted into pHSVS [47].

For this, the RV proteins were used in a structural vaccinology approach. The transduction with the RV protein encoding HSV-1 amplicon vector sWa[VP2/6/7] triggered the synthesis of all three encoded RV proteins, VP2, VP6 and VP7, as well as the intracellular assembly of RVLPs in cell culture. The distribution of the viral proteins within the cell resembled the localization of proteins in wild type RV infections. When administered intramuscularly, the RV proteins encoding HSV-1 amplicon vectors induced a strong RV specific antibody response in sera as well as in milk of vaccinated dams. In addition, the antibody response was passed through both the placental and/or lactogenic route to unvaccinated offspring swapped to vaccinated dams. As expected, lactogenic transfer of RV specific IgG did not protect the suckling mice from developing RV symptoms upon challenge. Indications of control of systemic spread were noted but will require more targeted experiments. Although full protection against an oral RV challenge was not achieved and would require both oral and systemic vaccination, the helpervirus-free herpesvirus amplicon vectors used in this study may be rapidly adapted to confer immunity against a whole array of different RVs.",

(A) Schematic representation of the polycistronic gene expression cassettes packaged into herpesvirus amplicon particles. Herpes simplex virus type-1 amplicon particles deliver a DNA cassette comprising a single polycistronic messenger RNA containing the coding sequences of three RV capsid proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7 separated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and controlled by the HSV-1 immediate early (IE) 4/5 promoter. The HSV-1 origin of DNA replication (oriS) and packaging/cleavage signal (pac) as well as the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (polyA) are indicated. The synthetic RV cassettes derived from the human Wa strain were adjusted to human codon usage (synthetic strain Wa, sWa). The RRV[VP7/6/2] was derived from the rhesus strain RRV and encodes, in addition to the RV proteins, for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as reporter gene. The sWa[VP2/6/7_V5] amplicon vector harbors a C-terminal V5 tag at VP7. The GFP amplicon vector encoding EGFP was used as control vector; (B) Rotavirus gene expression from codon optimized transgene cassettes. HepG2 cells were transduced with the indicated amplicon vectors (multiplicity of infection, MOI 2) or non-transduced (mock), and total cell lysates were harvested at 24 h post-transduction (hpt). Transgene expression was analyzed by Western blotting using the polyclonal anti-RV antibody to detect RV proteins (upper panel), the anti-V5 antibody for detection of the V5 tagged VP7 protein (middle panel), or the anti-actin and anti-GFP antibodies (lower panel). Detection of actin served as loading control. The predicted migration lengths of VP2 (104 kDa), VP6 (45 kDa), VP7 (37 kDa), VP7_V5 (42 kDa), actin (42 kDa) and GFP (27 kDa) are indicated on the left with arrows. The positions of the molecular weight markers are indicated on the right in kDa; (C) Analysis of protein synthesis in human and mouse cells. Human HepG2 or mouse Hepa 1-6 cells were transduced either with sWa[VP2/6/7], RRV[VP7/6/2] or GFP HSV-1 amplicon vectors (MOI 2) or non-transduced (mock) and total cell lysates were harvested 24 hpt.

Before the immunization of female BALB/c mice a blood sample was collected from each animal. Five days after intra muscular (i.m.) injection of the prime dose, a male was added for mating. Before booster immunization, blood samples were taken. For the first set of experiments, mice received a booster immunization at 19 days after prime dose injection, and, for the second set of experiments, at 20 days after prime dose injection. Blood and milk samples were taken on a regular basis starting on the day of parturition. (B\u2013D) Rotavirus specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum (B,D) or milk (C) levels of immunized mouse dams determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rotavirus-specific IgG in sera (1:5000 dilution) or milk (1:500 dilution) of either sWa[VP2/6/7] or GFP amplicon vector immunized animals was measured and plotted relative to the positive control applied on each ELISA plate that was taken as 100%. As positive control always the same sera of a RV hyperimmunized mouse from a previous study [17] (diluted 1:5000) was used. Relative IgG values were plotted on the ordinate in relation to the time after booster immunization in days on the abscissa. Values from na\u00efve sera are plotted on the time point \u221219 as these samples were taken before the first immunization (B).

Standard deviations between the measurements from sera of individual animals are indicated. In (C,D) time point 0 indicates values from milk (C) or serum (D) samples taken on the day of parturition, time point 3 includes all milk samples from three or four days after parturition and time point 6 includes all samples collected six or seven days post-delivery.
