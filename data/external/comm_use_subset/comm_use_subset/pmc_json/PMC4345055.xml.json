Influenza A (H1N1) was originally referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d because laboratory testing showed that many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to those found in pigs in North America. Further on, it has been found that this new virus has gene segments from the swine, avian, and human flu virus genes. The scientists call this a \u201cquadruple reassortant\u201d virus and hence this new (novel) virus is christened \u201cinfluenza-A (H1N1) virus\u201d [1].",

To access the intensity of an outbreak, transmission potential can be quantified by reproduction number R\n0, that is, average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a completely susceptible population [6, 7]. The importance of basic reproduction number R\n0 becomes more apparent when an emerging infectious disease strikes a population which is a key concept in the epidemic theory. If R\n0 is less than or equal to one, then transmission in the population goes stochastically extinct with probability of one after a small number of infections. If R\n0 is greater than 1, then there is a positive probability of a large epidemic. Statistical estimation of R\n0 is used to understand the transmission dynamics and evolution of the infectious disease which facilitate designing the effective public health intervention strategies and mitigation policies [8].",

Consider\n(1)jt=\u222b0\u221eA\u03c4jt\u2212\u03c4d\u03c4.\nSince R\n0 represents average number of secondary cases that a primary case generates during entire his/her infectious period, the estimate is given by [16, 17]\n(2)R0=\u222b0\u221eA\u03c4d\u03c4.\nUnder Kermack and McKendrick assumption \u201csingle infection causes an independent process of infection with host\u201d which allows an age representation for the state of infection, that is, infectivity of an individual. The time elapsed since infection is called the infection age or time since infection, whereas A(\u03c4) is expected infectivity of an individual with time-since-infection \u03c4 whereas A(\u03c4) becomes the rate of secondary transmission per single primary case at time-since-infection \u03c4 [18]:\n(3)A\u03c4=\u03b2\u03c4\u0393\u03c4,\nwhere \u03b2(\u03c4) is the transmission rate which depends on frequency of contact and infectiousness at infection age \u03c4 and \u0393(\u03c4) is the probability of being infectious at infection age \u03c4. Substituting A(\u03c4) into (1) we get\n(4)jt=\u222b0\u221e\u03b2\u03c4\u0393\u03c4jt\u2212\u03c4d\u03c4.\nFurther, we consider a probability density of the generation time where generation time is defined as time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual, denoted by g(\u03c4) through normalized density of secondary transmission [16, 17, 19]. We have\n(5)g\u03c4=\u03b2\u03c4\u0393\u03c4\u222b0\u221e\u03b2\u03c4\u0393\u03c4d\u03c4=\u03b2\u03c4\u0393\u03c4R0.\nUsing (5) in (4) we get\n(6)jt=\u222b0\u221eR0g\u03c4jt\u2212\u03c4d\u03c4.\nThen, the basic reproduction number R\n0 is as in\n(7)R0=j(t)\u222b0\u221eg\u03c4jt\u2212\u03c4d\u03c4.\nIn reality, the case incidences are rather in discrete form as daily/weekly reports. The discretized analogy of (7) can be derived as\n(8)R0=ji\u2211s=0\u221ewsji\u2212s.\nBy taking the inverse of both sides of (8) we get\n(9)1R0=\u2211s=0\u221ewsji\u2212sji,\nwhere s is the discretized form of time since infection (usually in days), i is discretized calendar time (usually in days/weeks), and w\ns is the generation time distribution for an infectious disease which is the probability distribution function for the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual [19, 20].",

Effective contacts lead to potential secondary cases with equal chance of getting the infection from the primary cases at time i. It has been seen that every contact does not lead to successful transmission of infection; that is, the effective contacts are uncertain which is defined as the contact that is sufficient to lead to the transmission of infection between infectious and susceptible population. The total number of effective contacts made by a potential primary case at time i is the sum of the product of incidence cases and generation time distribution during the generation interval of length m. This indicates a simple binomial law of uncertainty in effective contacts [22].",

As more evidence is gathered the prior distribution is modified into the posterior distribution that represents the uncertainty over the parameter values. Posterior distribution is derived from the Bayes formula [23]\n(12)\u03c0\u03b8/x=fx/\u03b8\u03c0(\u03b8)\u222b\u0398\u00b7fx/\u03b8\u03c0(\u03b8)d\u03b8,\nwhere \u222b\u0398\n\u00b7\nf(x/\u03b8)\u03c0(\u03b8)d\u03b8 is a normalization constant, x indicated data, \u03b8 is the unknown quantity, \u03c0(\u03b8) is the prior distribution, f(x/\u03b8) is the likelihood function, and posterior distribution \u03c0(\u03b8/x) completely describes the uncertainty. There are two key advantages of Bayesian theory: (i) once the uncertainty in the posterior distribution is expressed via probability distribution then the statistical inference can be automated and (ii) available prior information is reasonably incorporated into the statistical model. Now, the posterior estimate of parameter R\n0 is derived using its prior information, where likelihood function follows binomial distribution with conjugate prior as beta distribution of first kind [24]. That is, 1/R\n0 ~ Beta(a, b), with realistic choice of parameters (a, b):\n(13)\u03c01R0=1\u03b2(a,b)1R0a\u221211\u22121R0b\u221210<1R0<1, a>0, b>0.\nNow posterior distribution of 1/R\n0 is proportional to the likelihood times prior.

Theoretically, it is hard to find the posterior distribution of R\n0 where 1/R\n0 is a beta variable. Through simulation we have generated 10000 samples from beta posterior distribution and also estimated 95% CrI. We have considered beta distribution with several combinations of mean (ranges from 0.4 to 0.8) and accordingly we chose different values of (a, b). The second and fourth column of Table 1 represent our estimates of R\n0 which are posterior means along with 95% CrI.  Figure 3 displays the posterior distribution of R\n0 with different prior choices.",

Generation time is the average time taken for secondary infections produced by a primary infection [25]. Generation interval or generation time distribution is assumed to be known as Weibull distribution which is a biologically plausible choice [20, 26\u201328] with a mean of 1.78 and 2.48 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.66 and 1.06 days for s = 7 and 10 days [29, 30] (Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/256319).

We performed sensitivity analysis to quantify the effect of changes on R\n0. It has been used to determine how sensitive an estimate of the parameter is. It is usually performed as series of tests in which one can use different set of hyperparameter values to see the change in the estimate. Our analysis is based on the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in India 2009 through the Bayesian estimates of basic reproduction number; we used the daily reported cases to calculate effective contacts. We have calculated posterior distribution of R\n0 using prior as beta distribution with different values of parameter choices.
