Droplet and contact are thought to be primary modes of transmission for seasonal influenza; therefore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend medical masks during routine patient care, while N95 respirators are recommended during procedures in which aerosols may be generated and during other high\u2010risk situations.14, 15 However, there is increasing evidence of aerosol transmission of influenza during routine care as well (in the absence of aerosol generating procedures), which may warrant superior respiratory protection.16, 17 Influenza research is challenging because there is high seasonal variation in activity, and the level of circulating influenza in any given year cannot be predicted when planning RCTs. In addition, a diagnosis of influenza requires the detection of virus from respiratory specimens, or a fourfold rise in serological titres, both of which are highly resource\u2010intensive and depend on daily subject follow\u2010up and on optimal timing of specimen collection. For all these reasons, the published studies to date have been unable to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy against influenza infection between medical masks and N95 respirators. This study can therefore usefully inform policies for prevention of influenza.",

In the second RCT, continuous use of N95 respirators was associated with lower rates of CRI and laboratory\u2010confirmed bacterial colonisation compared to the medical mask use.4 Pooled analysis of these studies improved the power to analyse other infectious outcomes by intervention and to allow analysis by mode of transmission.",

Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet\u2010transmitted infections such as influenza.18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet\u2010transmitted infections with a high\u2010case fatality rate.6 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are not airborne infections, yet the CDC recommendation of using respirators to protect HCWs recognises the uncertainty around transmission.19, 20 The CDC initially recommended medical masks for Ebola, but changed their guidelines when US HCWs became infected, amidst unrest and challenges to the prior guidelines.6, 21 In contrast, the WHO recommends medical masks for MERS\u2010CoV and Ebola 22, 23 despite having older guidelines for filoviruses which recommended respirators.24 There is a need for a more evidence\u2010based approach to updating guidelines and ensuring consistency between different guidelines.25\n",

The IPD meta\u2010analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome. The major strength of this study is the use of the same endpoints, measurements and methods in the two trials, which allowed valid pooling of the data.",
