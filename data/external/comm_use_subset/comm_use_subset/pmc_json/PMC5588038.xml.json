The chemical diversity of these glycans contributes to their complex functional roles in controlling cell-cell, cell-pathogen, and cell-environment interactions. Linear and branched glycoconjugates of vertebrate cells are often terminated in sialic acids (Sias). Sias have critical roles in maintaining a variety of cell functions due to their abundance as exposed terminal sugars, where they are involved in highly specific and regulated cellular lectin interactions (2, 3). They have also been exploited by many different pathogens as well as by nonpathogenic microbes for host recognition and attachment, including playing a role as receptors for important disease-causing viruses, bacteria, and parasites (4, 5).",

In one series of modifications, the most common form, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), may be modified with acetyl groups (O-linked) at carbons -4, -7, -8, and/or -9 (8, 9). The presence and levels of O-acetylation likely result from combined functions of sialic acid O-acetyl transferases (SOAT) and esterases (SOAE), some of which have been identified and functionally demonstrated, while others are not yet characterized (10\u201312). A variety of studies have contributed to our understanding of the relative abundances and distributions of O-acetylated Sias in various eukaryotic systems, as reviewed by Mandal et al. (13). However, the recent development of recombinant sialoglycan-recognizing probes (SGRPs) recognizing different O-acetylated Sia forms allows their display at the cellular and tissue levels to be analyzed in more detail (14).",

Our understanding is clearest for the 9-O-acetyl-modified Sias, which have been detected in human and some other animal tissues with influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) proteins (8) and subsequently with porcine Torovirus HE (14). Those studies showed that 9-O-acetyl (9-O-Ac) Sias were common in many human tissues and on many cell lines of human origins, as well as being expressed by other animals and displayed within their tissues with highly variable patterns. Removal of 9-O-Ac Sias by expression of the influenza C 9-O-acetylesterase in transgenic mice resulted in developmental arrest of embryos around the 2-cell stage (15). Regulated 9-O-acetylation is also widely involved in various immunological pathways. For example, modification of the ganglioside GD3 (CD60) of proliferating T cells affects apoptotic pathways and their differentiation states (16), while Sia 9-O-acetylation on B-cell surface glycans blocks recognition by Sia-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin Siglec-2 (CD22), inhibiting receptor signaling and B-cell activation (17). Given their involvement in and regulation of cell signaling and proliferation processes, it is not surprising that abnormally displayed O-acetylated Sias are often oncogenic markers (18\u201321). Further additions of O-acetyl groups to the 7 and 8 positions give rise to di- and tri-O-acetylated Sias, respectively.",

            "text": "Influenza virus particles are decorated with the major glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) (displayed as trimers) and neuraminidase (NA) (displayed as tetramers) (27). Sias act as functional receptors for influenza virus infection as they are recognized and bound by the HA and are cleaved from cell glycans (and viral glycoproteins) by the sialidase function of NA (28\u201330). The specific chemistry and linkages of the cell Sias have long been known to influence HA and NA specificity and, ultimately, influenza virus infectivity. Influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) HAs from many hosts show strong preferences for binding and infection using Neu5Ac as a receptor, while modified Sias, including Neu5Gc and O-acetyl forms, may reduce or alter infection by those viruses (31). The Sia sugar linkage to the penultimate residue (\u03b12-3 versus \u03b12-6) affects HA Sia binding affinity and also contributes to host tropism differences between avian and human influenza virus strains (32, 33). O-acetyl modified Sias have been reported to affect influenza virus infections by altering the activities of HA and NA. One reported effect of O-acetylation is a general reduction in susceptibility to cleavage by sialidases, including influenza virus NA (34). A number of inhibitors of influenza viruses were identified historically, including the \u03b3-inhibitors, which are defined as sugar molecules that interact with influenza viruses to inhibit infection by acting as \u201cdecoy\u201d receptors (35\u201338). The 9-O-Ac Sias were also reported to reduce the sialidase activity of NA by almost 3-fold (39). Strong inhibition of infection and cell-to-cell spread of some human IAVs by horse and guinea pig sera was associated with the presence of high levels of 4-O-Ac Sias on plasma glycoproteins, including \u03b1-2-macroglobulin (35, 37, 40\u201343).",

For example, reovirus type 3 infection and replication were inhibited by the presence of 9-O-Ac Sia (48), as was Plasmodium falciparum binding to and invasion of erythrocytes (49). Many bacteria\u2014both pathogens and commensals\u2014bind to Sia and often express sialidases (neuramindases) that cleave it from glycans, and those activities are likely susceptible to the effects of modifications of the Sia substrate (50\u201353). In the bacterial oral pathogen Tannerella forsythia, an acetylesterase (NanS) is encoded within the Sia operon to remove human 9-O-Ac modifications and improve NanH sialidase function (54). Understanding the differences in the display and cell or tissue distributions of these modified Sia forms between various animals would therefore be of general interest for understanding how they may alter animal susceptibility to pathogens. Identifying their patterns of expression in tissues of hosts for influenza virus would also help to clarify their roles in controlling HA and NA specificities and activities and hence their effects on tropisms and host ranges of those viruses (55).",

Proteins were expressed from insect cells using a baculovirus vector and purified using protein G columns, resulting in isolation of a single protein (Fig. 1B). Those proteins contained N-linked (but not O-linked) glycans, as shown by treatment with enzymes specific for different glycosylation forms (Fig. 1C). As the proteins were produced in insect cells, they would display high-mannose N-linked glycans and would not themselves be sialylated. Testing the specificities of the SGRPs in a solid-phase lectin binding assay (spLBA) with either horse serum proteins (displaying 4-O-Ac Sias) or bovine submaxilliary gland mucin (7,9-O-Ac Sias and 9-O-Ac Sias) showed the expected binding specificities (Fig. 1D), and those were also confirmed by pretreating the Sia substrates with the esterase-active form of the proteins before conducting the assay, removing the binding substrate (Fig. 1D). The use of solutions at pH 6.5 during esterase treatments prevents O-acetyl migration on the Sia glycerol side chain (56, 57), and esterase controls performed alternatively at pH 7.5 confirmed previous findings of BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc (but not PToV-P4 HE-Fc) binding to 7,9-O-Ac Sias present in bovine mucin (58). We observed no binding of the SGRPs to nonmodified Sia substrates (bovine fetuin, various animal serums) or nonsialylated glycoprotein substrates (results not shown). Goat serum was used as a block of nonspecific binding of the anti-Fc secondary antibody in all subsequent tissue staining experiments. The Sia of that serum did not react with the probes on tissue slides or in testing performed by spLBA, suggesting that the serum does not contain O-acetylated Sias (results not shown).",

Both PToV-P4 HE-Fc and BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc bind specifically to 9-O-Ac sialic acids. While PToV-P4 HE-Fc binds only to Neu5,9Ac2, BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc binds to both Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu5Gc9Ac. Note that 9-O-acetylation is partially lost on many spots because of instability. Thus, results on those spots are meaningful only if binding is much better than that to the corresponding non-O-acetylated glycan spot. Glycan microarray results correlated with our spLBA observations and largely confirmed the Sia moiety specificity of the SGRPs. Glycan microarray results obtained with our SGRPs consistently overlapped previous results reported for these nidovirus HEs (14).",

The same general Sia identification patterns were observed in frozen tissue sections as in paraffin-embedded (PE) tissues. However, we observed staining variance in that frozen sections had both lower signal in the trachea and higher levels in the lung of 9-O-Ac Sias than in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and also showed some staining of the mucus that was still present on the slides (Fig. 4B).",

We observed some display of 4-O-Ac Sias in mice, but the amount seen in respiratory tissues was not as great. Previous reports (and our own unreported survey) showed that 4-O-Ac Sias in mice are highly tissue regulated and most abundantly found in the gastrointestinal tract (14). That Sia form was also identified in a very small number of cells within the duck, dog, and ferret respiratory tissues screened but not in the tissues of humans and pigs, and it appears not to be displayed on a variety of tissues examined in other studies in humans (14). We do not yet know the gene(s) encoding the 4-O-acetyltransferase, so it is unclear whether the trace display or absence of this modified Sia represents a genetic loss of the modifying enzyme in some species or variably regulated expression. The high levels of display of 4-O-Ac Sias in horses and guinea pigs are of interest, as horses have been the natural host of the H7N7 influenza virus, of two different H3N8 equine influenza viruses, and of an unknown influenza strain that spread widely around the year 1872 (63), while guinea pigs are naturally infected by and can transmit many strains of human influenza virus, including both H1N1 and H3N2 lineages (64). The presence of 4-O-Ac Sias in the respiratory tract therefore appears not to be a high barrier to at least some influenza virus infections, and it is currently not known whether their presence impacts the functions and evolution of HA and NA within the infecting influenza virus populations. The guinea pig tissues examined here did not display the 4-O-Ac Sia on airway-exposed tissues in the upper respiratory tract (trachea), so its role in laboratory infections performed with human viruses is unknown. Horse and guinea pig sera have long been known to be potent inhibitors of several H2 and H3 human influenza strains (35, 36, 65), and resistance to those sera could be selected through mutations in the HA at residue 145 (H3) that ablate 4-O-Ac binding (61). The presence of various amounts of sialidase-resistant Sias may therefore contribute to selection of influenza virus populations with HA variants, while its display on some horse and guinea pig cells in culture may provide an in vitro system suitable for the study of this modified Sia and its interactions with influenza and other viruses. Little is known about the direct effects of 4-O-Ac Sia on other microbes and pathogens, but their effects on sialidase (neuramindase) function would likely alter susceptibility in many respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens (66\u201368).",

            "text": "Both 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac Sias were widely displayed within the respiratory tissues of the influenza virus hosts, although with various locations and abundance levels. Previous studies performed using the influenza C HEF protein or HE-Fc proteins from bovine coronavirus and porcine Torovirus as probes for 7,9-O-Ac or 9-O-Ac Sias showed that they were widely displayed with significant variations (8, 14). The finding that high levels of both 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac Sias are found in the respiratory tracts of humans suggests that those may be a natural ligand for the human influenza viruses, as does the finding of both those modified Sias on MDCK cells and of the 9-O-Ac Sia in embyonated chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) cells. The 9-O-Ac Sias are the primary receptor for influenza C viruses, so their expression in the respiratory tissues of humans and on chicken egg membranes allows infection by that virus (69). However, the 9-O-Ac group may block binding of some viruses, including strains of influenza A virus. The presence of 9-O-Ac Sias in the submucosal glands of the human trachea suggests that they would be displayed in mucus as part of the biophysical barrier to influenza virus contacting epithelial cell receptors (70\u201373). The animal with the distribution of 9-O-Ac Sias that most closely mirrored that of humans was the mouse. Their specific distribution in the respiratory tracts of other mammalian species was more varied but included display in cells of the tracheal epithelium of pigs, horses, and dogs. The influenza D virus group also utilizes the 9-O-Ac Sia receptor, indicating that this Sia form is present in functional amounts in the respiratory tracts of at least pigs, cows, and other ruminants (45), and 9-O-acetyl forms are present at high levels in bovine submaxillary mucin (Fig. 1). In contrast, we were unable to detect 9-O-Ac Sias in the given respiratory tissues (trachea and lung) of guinea pigs despite their ability to support influenza D virus infection (74). It is possible that this receptor form is more abundant in the far upper respiratory tract, such as in the nasal cavity. Display in duck tissues of both the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract showed that such Sias would represent a Sia form encountered in the avian influenza virus ecological life cycle. The recent identification of a 9-O-acetyltransferase (CAS1 domain-containing protein 1 [CASD1]) will allow a closer examination of regulated expression of the modifying enzyme and the impact on tissue-specific display of 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias (10). In addition, genetic manipulation of expression in cells will allow testing of the functional effects of the modification.",

However, CMAH has been independently lost by mutation in several influenza virus hosts, including humans and ferrets and likely in Western breeds of dogs (76, 78, 79). Neu5Gc may to be present but at low levels in tissues of avian lineages (80\u201382), but as a CMAH homolog has not been found in birds, this expression may be due to metabolic incorporation from dietary sources.

That would require either the use of SGRPs that recognize only the nonmodified forms or HPLC analysis of tissue lysates for the presence of modified Sias. Other probes currently under development include CD22-Fc, which shows reduced or blocked Sia binding when the 9-O-Ac modification is present (84, 85). Previous HPLC analysis has allowed quantification of the ratios of the modified to unmodified Sias. In guinea pig liver tissue, it was seen that Neu5Ac comprises 85% of Sias and that Neu5Gc and Neu4,5Ac2 modified forms represent 5% and 10% of the remaining Sias, respectively (24). This may represent an underestimation of the levels due to O-acetyl instability and release during sample manipulation. Quantification by HPLC is an important part of Sia analysis in clarifying the relative levels of abundance but fails to identify and visualize the specific location of display of the modified Sia forms. In our future work, we will seek to explicitly control the levels of the modified Sias by esterase treatments and by modifying enzyme activities so that we can test their role in the infection and release of influenza virus and other viruses.",

To generate probe molecules, esterase domains were inactivated by changing the active site Ser residue to Ala by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs). The HE proteins were linked to the baculovirus gp64 signal sequence peptide at their N termini, and the C terminus was fused to a linker containing a thrombin cleavage sequence, the Fc domain of human IgG1, and a 6-His sequence. Constructs were cloned into pFastBac-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were then used to generate recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac following the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant baculoviruses were recovered by transfection of the bacmids into Sf-9 insect cells using Cellfectin II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Viruses were then used to infect a suspension of High Five cells and supernatants harvested 2 to 3 days postinfection. Proteins were purified from the infected cell culture supernatants by binding to a HiTrap protein G HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted with 0.1 M citrate (pH 3.0; pH neutralization to pH 7.8 with 1 M Tris, pH 9.0) using an \u00c4kta fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The HE-Fc-containing fractions were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated using 30-kDa Amicon Ultra-15 filters (EMD Millipore). Purified protein was observed by SDS gel migration as well as anti-human IgG Fc probing by Western blotting. Migration was retarded by the presence of glycosylation and confirmed by the use of various glycosidases (EndoH, PNGase, and O-glycosidase; New England Biolabs). Protein concentrations were determined from A280 readings, and proteins were stored at \u221280\u00b0C in aliquots or at \u221220\u00b0C in 50% (vol/vol) glycerol.",
