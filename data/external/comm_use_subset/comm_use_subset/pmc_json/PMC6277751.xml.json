The morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections could be even worse in developing countries, including China. Viral infections played an important role in pediatric lower respiratory tract infections, and the corresponding common viral pathogens were influenza A and B virus (IAV and IBV), parainfluenza virus (PIV, type 1 to 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human adenovirus (ADV) (Pavia, 2011). These seven viruses were also common in respiratory infections of the adult population in Shandong province, China (Liu et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge, there were no commercial vaccines available for most of these viruses, except for influenza A and B viruses (Lambkin-Williams et al., 2018).",

The knob region in adenoviral fiber was responsible for cellular attachment through host receptors including CAR, CD46, DSG-1 and sialic acids (Baker et al., 2018; Lenman et al., 2018). The RGD loop of penton could be recognized by the host cell\u2019s integrin (Veesler et al., 2014). The hexon protein is the major neutralizing antigen of adenoviruses (Madisch et al., 2005), while the hyper variable region (HVR) in hexon protein hosts its type specific epitopes reported by the authors\u2019 team (Yuan et al., 2009). Experiments on chimeric adenoviral capsids showed that the replacement of HVRs in hexon could alter the viral serotypes (Qiu et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2018). The hexon specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been proved to be an effective treatment for human adenoviral infections in clinical settings (Zandvliet et al., 2010; Feucht et al., 2015). Recent reports indicated that antibodies against fiber knob or penton base may also be involved in the neutralization of adenoviruses (Yu et al., 2013; Tomita et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, the hypervariable region of adenoviral hexon protein plays an essential role in viral type-specific immunity.",

Based on the evolutionary tree reconstruction of the hexon gene sequencing data, both strains isolated in this study were identified as human ADV species B type 3. These two strains were nearly identical, with the closest evolutionary distance to the strain GB (GenBank: AY599834; ATCC: VR-3) from the United States as well as the Harbin04B strain from a previous local epidemic, as shown in Figure 2. The parsimony tree was similar in topology with neighbor-joining tree (figure not shown in the article). Multiple sequence alignments indicated that, compared with the GB strain, the Harbin17A and Harbin17B strain shared a variable site in the 482nd codon (GB numbering) of the hexon gene hosting an A to C mutation, resulting in threonine (T) to proline (P) mutation of the amino acid sequences. The Harbin04B strain had a threonine on the same site in the hexon protein encoded by the codon ACU, which was identical to the Harbin17A and Harbin17B strain.",

The constantly changing nature of viral pathogens has made the surveillance of these infections critical to public health authorities (Zou et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). The key indicators for viral infections from this report and recent published surveys in China has been summarized in Table 4. The overall detection rate of viral infection among hospitalized adult patients in this report is 14.5%, which was consistent with the result of 16.8% in the age group above 14 years old by a national survey from 2009 to 2013 in China (Feng et al., 2014). The dominant viral pathogen throughout this study period was PIV, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus. The national survey on hospitalized patients with respiratory infection in China from 2009 to 2013 showed that influenza virus had the highest detection rate of 8.0% in adult patients. The detection rate of respiratory viruses in the over 16 years age group was 24.2% in Shandong province of China (Liu et al., 2015) and was dominated by influenza virus (8.7%) from 2011 to 2013. From 2012 to 2015, the respiratory viral detection rate in hospitalized patients above 14 years old within Beijing and Shandong China was reported to be 38.9%, in which influenza virus had the highest frequency of 8.0% (Yu et al., 2018). Compared with recent surveys in Beijing, Shandong and other regions in China, this report showed that the PIV dominated epidemic seasons from 2014 to 2017 in adult patients in Harbin, which should be important for preparing future epidemic control strategies in public health.",

ADV strain GB was named VR-3 in the ATCC database, which was isolated from an adult patient with common cold in Maryland, United States in 1953 (Huebner et al., 1954). The similarity of these strains across Asian and American continents through several decades may result from the globalization movement in modern China. It could also be explained by another hypothesis based on the evolution history of adenoviruses. On the geological scale, Homo sapiens inherit human adenoviruses from our ancestors within the Hominidae, resulting in an evolutionary rate of human ADV as low as 2.8E-8 substitution per site per year (Hoppe et al., 2015).
