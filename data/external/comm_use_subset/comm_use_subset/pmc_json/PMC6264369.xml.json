The two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, \u201cAsian Influenza (1957/H2N2)\u201d and \u201cHong Kong Influenza (1968/H3N2)\u201d resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2\u20133 million people globally [1,2]. Today, their descendants continue to cause the majority of influenza infections in humans [3]. So far as it is learned that the most effective antiviral drug is the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, which target the NA glycoproteins of influenza A and B virus [4,5].",

The NA inhibitors were designed to prevent the key step by blocking the active site of enzyme and thus allow sufficient time for the host immune systems to remove infected viruses [7]. Consistent efforts have been devoted to the development of NA inhibitors, using the crystal structure of the N2 sub-type NA protein [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Indeed, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the representative NA inhibitor that has proven to be uniquely applicable oral drug in clinical practice for the treatment of influenza infection [4,8,9]. However, with an increase in medical use, the oseltamivir-resistant strains have been found and probably lead to a large scale outbreak of novel pandemic flu [16,17].",

Patchouli oil is an important essential oil in the perfume industry, used to give a base and lasting character to a fragrance [16,17]. The essential oil is very appreciated for its characteristic pleasant and long lasting woody, earthy, and camphoraceous odor, as well as for its fixative properties, being suitable for use in soaps and cosmetic products [16,17]. The aerial part of Pogostemon cablin has wildly been used for the treatment of the common cold and as an antifungal agent in China [16,17]. Moreover, the plant is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as it presents various types of pharmacological activity according to the composition of the oil [16,17]. Patchouli alcohol, as the major volatile constituent of patchouli oil, has been found to strongly inhibit H1N1 replication and weakly inhibit B/Ibaraki/2/85 replication [18]. ",

It showed best antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 8 \u00b5M during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 97.68% \u00b1 2.09% for influenza A (H2N2) at 72 h. However, no significant effect was detected when patchouli alcohol was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when patchouli alcohol was only added during the adsorption phase. These results suggested that the inhibition of influenza A (H2N2) virus by patchouli alcohol appears to occur much more strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. Besides, biochemical studies have indicated that the bioactivity of NA protein is essential determinant after the replication of influenza A (H2N2) virus [20,21,22]. Hence, we conclude that the function of NA protein may be suppressed by patchouli alcohol.",

The mean weights of mice administered at the 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol and 10 mg/kg/dose of patchouli alcohol one time daily for 7 days were not significantly different compared with the normal control mice, showing no toxicity of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir within the testing concentration (P > 0.05). Physiological status was observed in virus infection mice. Three days after viral infection, some mice, especially mice in the H2N2 infected control group showed changes in behavior, such as a tendency to huddle, diminished vitality, and ruffled fur, etc. In the mouse influenza model, viral infection leads to loss of body weight and high mortality. Therefore, the efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir were evaluated on the basis of survival rate measured for 15 days post-infection, for treated infected animals relative to untreated infected (control) animals. A comparison of efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir in vivo mouse influenza model (oral treatment) showed that at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the influenza virus, as the mean day to death was detected as 11.8 \u00b1 1.1 (Table 2). When the dose was lowered to 1 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed weaker protection (measured by Survivors/total) than that of 5 mg/kg/day, the mean day to death was 7.5 \u00b1 1.8. Whereas oseltamivir at this dose level (1 mg/kg/day) showed 50% protection (measured by survivors/total) against the influenza virus. In the H2N2 infected control group, there were no survivors. In view of both in vitro and in vivo data, we conclude that patchouli alcohol could be used in the treatment of human influenza virus infections.",

As shown in Figure 4, the patchouli alcohol was bound at the active site which also bound to oseltamivir and zanamivir [28]. As Figure 5 shows, the oxygen atom of patchouli alcohol was oriented towards the sidechains of residues Glu119 and Tyr406, with one H-bond formed with each residue. The values of distances in Figure 6 further reveal that the docked complex remains rather stable throughout the simulation, with the average distances of Glu119:OE2 \u2014 patchouli alcohol:O and Tyr406:OH \u2014 patchouli alcohol:O less than 2.8 \u00c5. The sum contributions (Esum) of residues Glu119 and Tyr406 amounted to \u22128.46 and \u22127.37 kcal mol\u22121, respectively (Table 3). Besides, patchouli alcohol was stabilized by residues Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Trp178, Ala246, Glu276, Arg292, Asn294 and Gln347, especially residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 (Figure 5 and Table 3). As a matter of fact, residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 of the NA protein have already received enough attention from rational drug designs [14,30,31]. The catalytic residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 are crucial to the NA functions and the residues Glu119 and Tyr406 are important to stabilize the NA active sites [32,33]. It suggests that the NA functions will be affected by the presence of patchouli alcohol, consistent with the above experiments. Patchouli alcohol matches with the NA active site and has an acceptable interaction energy. Considering the obvious structure discrepancies against current NA inhibitors, it represents an ideal lead compound for the designs of novel anti-influenza agents.",

            "text": "The N2 sub-type neuraminidase crystal structure (PDB code 1IVD) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank [34]. For convenience, the structure is named as NA hereafter. Geometry and partial atomic charges of the patchouli alcohol (Figure 1) were calculated with the Discover 3.0 module (Insight II 2005) [35] by applying the BFGS algorithm [36] and the consistent-valence force-field (CVFF), with a convergence criterion of 0.01 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22121. The docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by the general protocols in the Insight II 2005 software packages, consistent with the previous literatures [24,26,28,35,37,38,39]. During the MD simulations, the canonical ensemble (NVT) was employed at normal temperature (300 K). The MD temperature was controlled by the velocity scaling thermostat [40]. Integrations of the classical equations of motion were achieved using the Verlet algorithm. The systems were solvated in a large sphere of TIP3P water molecules [40] with the radius of 35.0 \u00c5, which is enough to hold the ensembles [40]. The MD trajectories were generated using a 1.0-fs time step for a total of 20.0 ns, saved at 5.0-ps intervals. The interaction energies of patchouli alcohol with NA and the respective residues at the NA active site were calculated by the Docking module [35], over the 0.5~20.0 ns MD trajectories. ",
