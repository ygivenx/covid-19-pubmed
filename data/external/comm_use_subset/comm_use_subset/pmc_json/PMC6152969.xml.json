            "text": "Hepatitis A is a disease caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV). Most outbreaks of hepatitis A have been linked to consumption of uncooked contaminated foods, and contaminated waters. It was noted that some outbreaks are propagated through close contact between humans (e.g., [1,2]). Wu et al [3] reported an outbreak at an elementary school of 698 pupils in Anhui province, China. Twenty-eight serologically confirmed cases aged between 7 and 13 years with symptom onset from 7 May to 8 June 2011 were reported in the school. The social network analysis found that all these 28 cases were connected to a cluster of three pupils with clinical symptom onset on 23, 30 March and 10 April through direct contact or a shared social setting. These three cases were presumed to link to a 4-year-old boy (described as boy A) who had symptom onset on 10 March and was the most probable source case. The investigations provided evidence that this outbreak was due to human-to-human transmission.",

All of the cases in this outbreak (except boy A) were children born before 2006 and had not received free vaccination which was introduced in 2006 in Anhui province, China [3]. All the 32 cases had their symptom onset dates recorded and the network diagram presented in Fig 1 of [3] showed that there were 15 cases who had a uniquely known infector. To effectively control the spread and outbreak of hepatitis A, it is important to know its transmissibility which will help estimate the proportion of children that have to be vaccinated to create herd immunity that would protect the whole community. Wu et al [3] also noticed that the only five sporadic cases of HAV infection identified during 2004\u20132010 in the town at which the school was located were adults aged >25 years. It is well known that many HAV infections in children are asymptomatic [4,5]. Wu et al. [3] reported that about 40% of the symptomatic cases did not recall any close contact with jaundiced persons and environmental sources of infection were not justified. Wu et al [3] further found that 53.5% of 144 pupils at the school who were without symptoms after the outbreak were positive for the IgG antibodies tests. These two facts suggest that transmission occurs from asymptomatic cases as well as from symptomatic cases. This study [3] for the outbreak provides a good dataset to estimate the transmissibility of hepatitis A virus among na\u00efve young children, which is the objective of this study.",

It is a threshold parameter: if R0<1, the disease dies out without any intervention; otherwise, the disease can persist and cause epidemics. Another relevant parameter is the effective reproductive number (Rt), the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infective individual introduced into a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible individuals. Rt is a key parameter that describes the state of an epidemic and is important for judging whether the intervention is working to keep the infection under control [7].",

For simplicity, in this study we assume symptom onset coincides with the onset of infectiousness, and so we approximate the generation time (the average duration between the time of infection of each infected case and the time of infection of their infector) by the serial interval (the average difference in symptom onset dates of infector-infectee pairs).",

The method [9] is a development of method of [10] by further combining partly known contact information among cases with the time intervals in symptom onset between cases to construct the transmission tree. The general idea is to estimate the probability pij(v;w;\u03b8), that case j is the infector of case i, (where j = 1 is the index case) given the duration |ti-tj| between symptom onset of case i and case j, given the information on the known possible infector v (i.e. a vector representing the case identifiers of the infector of case 2,\u2026,n) and the known contacts w (i.e. a vector representing the case identifiers of the contacts of case 2,\u2026,n). The method also assumes that observed serial intervals are positive random variables described by a serial interval distribution, g(\u0394t |\u03b8), here assumed to be a gamma distribution with parameter set \u03b8 = {shape, rate}. The probability pij, can be calculated as that of observing the duration between the symptom onsets in cases i and j, g(ti-tj|\u03b8), times the probability of a potentially infectious contact between i and j, \u03c0ij, normalized by the probability of i being infected by any other case k:\npij(v,w;\u03b8)=\u03c0ij(v,w)g(ti\u2212tj|\u03b8)\u2211k\u2260i\u03c0ik(v,w)g(ti\u2212tk|\u03b8)(1)\nThe probability, \u03c0ij, is based on the contact information (v,w) of both cases i and j collected during the outbreak (see Table 2). If case i has \u201csuspected source(s) of infection\u201d, \u03c0ij = 1/(number of suspected sources of infection) for j equal to one of the \u201csuspected source of infection\u201d and \u03c0ij = 0 otherwise. If \u201csuspected source of infection\u201d is \u201cunknown\u201d for case i, \u03c0ij = 1/(number of cases with onset before case i) for case j that has symptom onset before case i, and \u03c0ij = 0 for others j.",

Wu et al [3] reported that some interventions had been taken to control the continuing infection such as isolating affected patients in hospitals, placing members of these cases\u2019 families and other contacts under medical observations, and recommending pupils to take basic hygiene measures. These and other interventions should have been involved during the outbreak and they might start at different times. Here we model the interventions by simplifying the complex processes and assume that they collectively acted to make a change in contact rate and thus transmissibility at some time point tc. Let ct be the number of cases whose symptom onset at day t, its expected value is approximated by\nE(ct)=R0\u22110<t\u2212sct\u2212sws,t<tc;E(ct)=R0\u22110<t\u2212s<tcct\u2212sws+Rc\u2211t\u2212s\u2265tcct\u2212sws,t\u2265tc.(4)\nHere ws represent the probability mass function of the serial interval of length s days, which can be obtained by\nws=G(s)\u2212G(s\u22121)(5)\nwith G(.) representing the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution. After the turning point tc, the reproductive number reduces from R0 to Rc. Here R0 represents the reproductive number in the absence of any control or susceptible depletion and the value of Rc shows the impact of countermeasures. Neglecting depletion of susceptibles is justified by the fact that the number of infected individuals is very small compared to the total number of pupils (28 vs 698). (It is worth noticing that in statistical estimation methods all infections are assumed to be symptomatic) This allows using of R0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number (the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan) as originally used in [11]. More complicated modifications have been proposed for the renewal equation to reflect the outbreaks that will finish with many individuals still being susceptible (e.g., [12]).",

Based on the contact network information provided in [3], serial interval is directly estimated to have a mean of 23.9 days and a standard deviation of 20.9 days. The mean estimates of the transmissibility of hepatitis A virus from three different statistical methods before effective control range from 2.1 to 2.8, with their 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.8 to 4.5. Transmission dynamics model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, generates an estimate of 2.7. When assuming all infections are symptomatic in transmission dynamics model, the estimate reduces to 2.1. These results are well in agreement with statistical estimates which are based on symptomatic case data alone. By further incorporating the results of IgG antibodies test [3], our transmission dynamics model suggests that about 91% of the HAV infections in the school children are asymptomatic. This result suggests that at the end of the outbreak there are total of about 344 asymptomatic infections along with 32 symptomatic cases. This estimate of asymptomatic proportion is consistent with the general estimate [17,18]. The common knowledge is that hepatitis A in children is mostly an asymptomatic disease while adolescents and adults usually show symptoms of clinical hepatitis. For example, one estimation [19] indicates that 80 to 95% of children less than 5 years old have asymptomatic infections, compared to 10 to 25% of adults. A study [20] in Taiwan shows that among children under the age of 10 years, only 10.6% (10/94) of the IgM-anti-HAV positive cases had clinical symptoms.",

It is known that people infected with hepatitis A virus experience an incubation period of 28 days ranging 15\u201350 days to become ill [16,24]. When symptoms occur, they typically last eight weeks [25]. Assuming random mixing and that the latent period is 7 days [16], we have the estimates of serial interval of HAV as SI = 7 + (8\u201343)/2+56/2 = 39\u201356 days, taking the middle 48 days as the average. Our direct estimate of serial interval from 15 infector-infectee pairs has a mean of 24 days, which is much shorter than the above guess from experts\u2019 views. The possible explanations for this difference may lie in the fact that the infected persons are all school children at a same elementary school and close and frequent contacts make the transmission quickly. Nevertheless, it should be noted that our estimate has a long tail with 95% confidence interval ranging from about 2 to 79 days, which overlaps with the experts\u2019 guess.",

In this study we introduce an objective time turning point tc to indicate the effective and collective start of a variety of countermeasures during the outbreak of hepatitis A in 2011 in Anhui province, China. We hence approximate the average reproductive number before this point as R0. In general, for any outbreak of infectious disease that originated from one index case and was self-limited or stopped under control, its overall reproductive number throughout the entire outbreak course has a mean equal to (n-1)/n for an outbreak of size n, and its variance can vary from (n-1)/n2 to (n-1)3/n2, depending on the structure of the transmission tree (c.f. [28,29]). For the 2011 outbreak in Anhui, the overall mean of reproductive number through the whole outbreak is 0.969, with a standard deviation of 0.106. It is obvious that the overall mean of reproductive number cannot tell us anything about the transmissibility of the infectious agent because it reflects the mixture of the pure transmissibility and countermeasures involved during the outbreak. What we are keen to estimate and is relevant to response plan for policymakers is the transmissibility under somewhat natural conditions (e.g., without changes in humans\u2019 behavior and active control strategies, with all people being susceptible). This simple method of considering growth reduction during the outbreaks can also be applied to the analyses for other outbreaks of other infectious agents [29].",

For an outbreak caused by such pathogen, the only available data are about symptomatic infections or so at least at the early stage of the outbreak. Theoretically we can argue that if the proportion of symptomatic infections remains unchanged over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, the estimate of R0 based only on symptomatic cases should give similar results [8]. In this study we test this for a hepatitis A outbreak using a transmission dynamics model. For this, we investigated two model variants: one includes both types of infection and the other considers only symptomatic infections. We found that the estimates of R0 from the two model variants, albeit being different, are reasonably in agreement with each other. This is understandable because asymptomatic and symptomatic cases are assumed to be indistinguishable in their infectivity and their life history (i.e. recovery and transition rate to the symptomatic and asymptomatic class), in addition to the assumption of constant proportion of asymptomatic cases over the outbreak. Testing these assumptions is an important research area for future clinical studies. The difference in the estimates of R0 from the two model variants is also understandable because of the stochasticity in the transmission processes and the limited number of generations during the outbreak.",
