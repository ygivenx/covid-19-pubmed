            "text": "Over the last several decades, much effort has been devoted to develop efficient bioaerosol control methods and devices, including thermal methods [6\u20138], ultraviolet irradiation [9\u201311], antimicrobial filters [12,13], and titanium dioxide catalysis [14,15]. Among these, antimicrobial air filtration technologies are considered promising because they are easily applied to conventional air-conditioning systems. Previous studies have shown that air filtration technologies employing antimicrobial inorganic nanoparticles are effective in controlling bacterial aerosols. The antimicrobial efficacies of such systems depend on the exposure time, particle size, and concentration [16,17]. In particular, silver (Ag) nanoparticles are antimicrobial agents with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. Ag nanoparticles damage bacterial cell membranes and induce metabolic changes by decreasing enzyme activity [18,19]. Due to the outstanding antimicrobial activity of these materials, they have been extensively studied and applied in a variety of fields including indoor air quality (IAQ) and human health, air filtration, clothing manufacturing, electronics, food processing, cosmetics, and medical devices [20,21]. Similarly, copper (Cu) nanoparticles are widely known as antimicrobial substances. Previous studies showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to Cu nanoparticles [22]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also been applied to the control of water quality and IAQ. In their aquatic dispersion, CNTs showed strong antimicrobial activities as the reduction in bacterial viability reached a maximum of ~6 log, and in combination with Ag nanoparticles enhanced the antimicrobial activity of air filters. CNTs in direct contact with bacterial cells induce membrane damage and subsequent cell death. Single-walled CNTs are more toxic to bacteria than multi-walled CNTs [23\u201325].",

Natural products, such as plant extracts, are typically less toxic relative to inorganic antimicrobial materials [42]. Natural-product nanoparticles consist of multiple compounds with various chemical properties. Depending on the extract and the nature of the material, these properties can include antibiotic activities such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and/or antimicrobial effects [43\u201346]. Many natural antimicrobial products have been discovered, including extracts from Ratibida latipalearis, Teloxys graveolens, Dodonaea viscosa, Hyptis albida, Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil), and Sophora flavescens [47\u201350]. In addition, various chemical compounds contained in natural products have been shown to control bacterial metabolism. Recently, reports detailing the control of bacterial aerosols using natural-product nanoparticles have shown that extracted essential oils can reduce bacterial loads when applied to contaminated ventilation systems [51]. Air filters coated with tea tree oil inactivated ~99% of bacteria on their surface within 2\u20138 min. Filters coated with S. flavescens nanoparticles inactivated >91% of bacteria within 2 min [12,41,51].",

However, the antimicrobial activity of E. japonica when used in an air filtration system has not been reported. E. japonica nanoparticles were produced by a nebulization-thermal drying process [55,56]. The characteristics of E. japonica nanoparticle-coated filters were evaluated in terms of filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and antimicrobial activity under various particle deposition conditions. Additionally, the major components of the extract were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS/MS) and the cytotoxicity of E. japonica was compared with that of a soluble nickel compound (SNC), a known human carcinogen.",

The distribution is best represented by a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of 75.16 nm, a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 75.82 nm, and geometric standard deviation (GMD) of 1.217. The particles generated from methanol showed a broad size distribution, and compared to size distribution and concentration of natural-product nanoparticles, the particles generated from methanol were trivial (<3%). The deposition efficiency of these particles is shown in Fig 2 (B). More than 98% of particles with diameters less than 43 nm and greater than 277 nm were deposited onto the control filter. The deposition efficiency of particles between 43 and 277 nm was lower. The lowest deposition efficiency on the control filter was ~85.3% for particles 92 nm in diameter. The relatively low deposition efficiency observed for particles between 43 and 277 nm results from the mechanism of particle filtration. Particles with midrange diameters were too large for diffusion filtration and too small for impaction and interception mechanisms [1]. SEM micrographs show spherical and polydisperse natural-product nanoparticles on the filter fibers (Fig 2 (B)). The quantity of deposited material was determined by weighing the filters before and after particle deposition using a microbalance (Mettler MT5; Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea).

Filtration efficiencies were tested using S. epidermidis and M. luteus aerosols. As shown in Table 1, the test bacteria concentrations were ~278 (S. epidermidis) and ~234 particle/cm3 (M. luteus), respectively. The distribution of the S. epidermidis aerosol was a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of ~0.84 \u03bcm, a GMD of ~0.81 \u03bcm, and a GSD of ~1.22 (S1 Fig, Table 1). Although the shape of size distribution curve of the M. luteus aerosol was similar to that of S. epidermidis aerosol, the M. luteus particles were larger than those of S. epidermidis (S1 Fig). No statistically significant difference was observed between the filtration efficiencies of filters that had been coated for 3 and 9 min (p >0.05). However, because of the dissimilar size distributions of the two bacterial aerosols, filtration efficiencies of the two species were slightly different (p <0.05): ~97% for S. epidermidis and 95% for M. luteus. Also, note that flat panel-type filters were used in these tests to estimate the effects of natural-product nanoparticles. Real-world applications would typically employ folded filters to increase the filtration area and decrease the pressure drop.",

M. luteus was more resistant to the E. japonica extract than S. epidermidis under all conditions (p <0.05), with a maximum difference of ~17%. Although both M. luteus and S. epidermidis are Gram-positive bacteria, M. luteus is more suited to survive in extreme and/or nutrient-poor environments over extended periods of time [61]. Similarly, in extreme environments, Micrococcus strains have been shown to exhibit greater resistance to novobiocin than Staphylococcus strains [62].",

The results showed that the chromatogram detected at 280 nm contains three major peaks (1\u20133) with relative peak areas of 16.6, 5.8, and 3.2%, respectively (S2 Fig). Positive and negative ion mode ESI/MS was used to identify these three major peaks. Peak 1 corresponded to a [M-H]- ion at m/z 935 in negative ion mode. In positive ion mode, Peak 1 corresponded to the [M+H2O]+ ion at m/z 954. Fragmentation of peak 1 produced product ions at m/z 785 (loss of gallic acid) and m/z 767 (loss of gallic acid and H2O). Peak 1 was therefore identified as 1(\u00df)-O-galloyl pedunculagin. The presence of ions at m/z 301 or 284 in the mass spectra of peaks 2 and 3 indicated that these compounds were quercetin and kaempferol derivatives, respectively. Peak 2 yielded a [M-H]- ion at m/z 477 and another characteristic fragment at m/z 301, corresponding to the loss of a glucuronide moiety. Peak 2 was therefore assigned to quercetin-3-O-glucuronide. Peak 3 yielded a [M-H]- ion at m/z 447 (corresponding to an aglycone) and a major fragment ion at m/z 284 due to the loss of a hexose unit, and was identified as kaempferol-3-O-glucoside. These results were confirmed by comparisons with MS data in previous reports [63\u201365]. Previous studies showed that flavonoids quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside exhibited antibacterial activity by reducing the fluidity of the inner and outer layers of bacterial membranes, inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis, and deterring energy metabolism [66]. Quercetin-3-O-glucuronide showed stronger antibacterial activity and a lower acute toxicity than kaempferol-3-O-glucoside [67]. The antibiotic activities of 1(\u00df)-O-galloyl pedunculagin are not well known. Thus, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside likely play important roles in determining the antimicrobial efficacy of E. japonica.",

The pressure drop and antimicrobial activity of nanoparticle-coated filters increased with increasing nanoparticle deposition time. HPLC and ESI/MS analyses showed that the major chemical compounds in the E. japonica extract were 1(\u00df)-O-galloyl pedunculagin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside. The latter two compounds likely play important roles in the inactivation of bacterial aerosols. In vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that E. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and had stronger antimicrobial activity on some bacterial strains than the SNC, which is classified as a human carcinogen. Note that the amount of nanoparticles deposited on a given filter must be optimized for the type of bacterial aerosol. The antimicrobial performance of the E. japonica nanoparticle-coated filters depended both on the amount of nanoparticles deposited and the nature of the airborne bacteria. Additionally, previous studies showed that major chemical components in a natural product were naturally degraded over time at room temperature [69] and antimicrobial activity and morphologies of natural-product nanoparticles were affected by a variety of environmental factors such as humidity and temperature [40,70]. Thus, the long-term stability and effects of humidity and thermal energy on E. japonica nanoparticles need to be evaluated to estimate the efficiency of nanoparticle-coated filters for real-world applications. Although the in vitro tests showed that E. japonica is less toxic than the carcinogen, it does not mean that the natural product is harmless to human health. Thus, additional studies such as in vivo experiments are required. In a biological setting, many experimental values should be considered. Thus, field experiments are required to confirm the applicability of the natural-product nanoparticle-coated filter in a real environment. We are considering a field experiment of our filters in a future study. This study provides valuable information for the development of an environmentally friendly bioaerosol control system that is suitable for use in indoor environments.",
