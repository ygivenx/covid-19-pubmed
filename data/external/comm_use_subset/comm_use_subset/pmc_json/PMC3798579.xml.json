Some classrooms in each school had a policy of letting children gargle; others did not. Although gargling information was collected by a questionnaire and analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, a classroom teacher instructed children to gargle at all scheduled times and visually confirmed that they had gargled. Gargling was conducted by rinsing the throat (garagara-ugai method) at least once a day with any of the following agents: tap water, saline water, green tea, and functional water (alkali ion water or ozone water). Body temperature was measured by the classroom teacher, and fever onset was defined as a body temperature of 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) or higher. Each teacher recorded dates of absence and, when a child was absent, the reason for absence was obtained from the children\u2019s parents.",

In 2 previous studies showing that gargling prevented adult upper respiratory tract infections (mainly induced by viral infections), the authors also could not explain how gargling prevented viral infection.4,14 A plausible explanation is that chlorine is added to tap water by law. The concentration of residual chlorine in tap water in Fukuoka City was 0.60 mg/L at the time of our study, which would have ensured inactivation of viruses and bacteria.15,16 Another explanation was suggested by a randomized clinical trial showing that oral rinsing with chlorhexidine gluconate for 30 seconds twice a day reduced the total nosocomial respiratory infection rate among patients in a cardiovascular intensive care unit.17 The authors of that article noted that reducing oropharyngeal microbial flora by oral rinsing with an antiseptic agent twice a day could have impeded aspiration of organisms that cause respiratory infections. Although the above hypotheses are consistent with our findings, more laboratory research is needed to clarify the mechanism by which gargling prevents disease.",

To better understand the effect of nocturnal fever onset, the reasons for absences associated with fever should be selectively extracted and analyzed. However, the reasons reported by parents varied widely and were often too vague to identify a specific disease (eg, \u201choarseness,\u201d \u201clooking sick,\u201d or \u201cnot doing well\u201d). Therefore, we could not confirm the effect of gargling on sickness absences or determine why the odds ratio for nocturnal fever onset was close to unity in gargling children.",

Randomization is preferable, as it avoids potential confounding factors. However, randomization of gargling is difficult, as it is believed to be a beneficial behavior. To minimize the effect of potential confounding factors, we conducted analyses stratified by age, which was considered a major confounding factor, and included the location of the school (ward) in some models. Since there was some variability among wards in the proportion of fever onset in the gargling group, the location of the school was assumed to be a confounding factor in the effect of gargling. We postulated that differences in socioeconomic status (SES) played a major role in this variability. SES is believed to be associated with susceptibility to respiratory infection, and previous studies suggested that decreases in SES were correlated with lower susceptibility.25 Unfortunately, data on parameters that directly reflect SES were not collected in this study, and we could not acquire information on the SES of each school or child after the survey. The effect of SES, therefore, was not fully adjusted and should be addressed in future surveys. Second, we did not collect detailed information on the method of gargling and other practices of infection prevention (especially hand washing). However, it is unlikely that they varied greatly among children in Japan because gargling and hand-washing are widely practiced throughout the country, and children receive instructions on gargling and hand-washing technique. In addition, both the child health authority of Fukuoka City and Fukuoka Medical Association provided explicit instruction to participating nurseries to encourage children to wash their hands.",
