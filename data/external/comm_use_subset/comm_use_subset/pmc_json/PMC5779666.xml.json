            "text": "Vaccines are important for controlling or preventing diseases. Newly generated and current developing vaccines are highly purified recombinant antigens with a higher safety, but purified antigens cannot stimulate a satisfactory immune response compared with attenuated or inactivated pathogen preparations. With the aid of adjuvants, vaccines can induce persistent immune responses [1,2]. New powerful adjuvants are widely concerned in both vaccine development and human health. To date, various adjuvants have been identified and extensively studied. These adjuvants endow vaccines with several advantages, including decreasing the required amount of antigens, minimizing the number of immunizations required for normal immune responses, and inducing more rapid, broader, and stronger immune responses [3\u20135]. Although many potent adjuvants have been developed, such as lipolysaccharide (LPS) and Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (FCA), they are not widely applied due to their toxicity. Hence, only a few adjuvants, such as Alum, are licensed for clinical use [6]. Overall, more effective and safer adjuvants should be developed to promote the better prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against infectious and noninfectious diseases.",

Chinese herbaceous constituents include nutrients and important active composites, such as phenolic compounds and polysaccharides, which can act as powerful immunostimulants [7\u20139]. Among them, polysaccharides from traditional Chinese herbs have been widely explored due to their immunostimulatory activities and low toxicity. For example, inulin is an immune adjuvant without the toxicity of other adjuvants such as FCA. AdvaxTM delta inulin adjuvant also has successfully enhanced the immunogenicity of vaccine [10,11]. Astragalus, also known as Huangqi in Chinese and Radix Astragali in Latin, is widely distributed throughout the world. Polysaccharide is one of its major active ingredients responsible for the immunomodulatory activity. Experimental studies have demonstrated that Astragalus polysaccharide possessed strong immunomodulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo [12, 13]. Lycium barbarum polysaccharides as vaccine adjuvant also showed good improvements and stimulating effects [14, 15]. These studies suggested that Chinese herbral polysaccharides were ideal candidates for adjuvant development.",

Ma (CD, \"Rou Cong Rong\" in Chinese) is a valuable traditional Chinese herb and commonly considered as \u201cGinseng of the deserts\u201d because of its superior tonic effects. It is distributed in arid or semi-arid regions in Xinjiang. In China, its dried fleshy stem has been used as a tonic food for hundreds of years [16, 17]. For many years, boiled CD has been used as a tonic food to treat overstrain-induced impairment, suggesting that it is safe for oral administration. This plant is widely concerned due to its broad medicinal functions. Recent phytochemical and pharmacological studies demonstrated that polysaccharides were the main biologically active components and had various biological effects, including the immunomodulatory activity, antioxidant effect, and anti-inflammatory effects [18\u201321]. However, the immune enhancement activity of water-extractable polysaccharides from C. deserticola in Xinjiang was seldom reported.",

We examined the specific immune response to ovalbumin (OVA) in mice treated with WPCD, including titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subclass, T- and B- proliferation, and the production of cytokine. We investigated whether WPCD treatment would increase the activity of DCs and Treg cells in the spleen of these mice.

In FCM analysis, the degree of aggregation of stimulated cells is an indirect indicator of evaluating safety of immunomodulators [3]. Thus, WPCD adjuvant activity data in DCs in vitro may provide valuable information for animal models. Based on BM-DC model, the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, cytokine production, and allogenic T cell proliferation were detected in the optimum WPCD concentration range. The expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40 were up-regulated in BM-DCs and the yields of TNF-a and IL-12 were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The allogenic T cell proliferation was observed. The morphology of BM-DCs was not changed. By inducing BM-DCs activation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in vitro, WPCD adjuvant might significantly increase the amount of antigen and the amount of APCs and stimulate T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3, which contributes to the enhancement of immunomodulatory activity.",

Among the observations in immunized mice models, WPCD led to an increase in OVA-specific and non-specific splenocyte proliferation compared with Alum. Some adjuvants up-regulate cytokines and the immune system. For example, saponins may stimulate cell-mediated immune responses to an antigen which normally induces only antibodies. We selected IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 as the indicators to indirectly evaluate the levels of immunities in mice. WPCD could induce more IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 secretions than Alum.
