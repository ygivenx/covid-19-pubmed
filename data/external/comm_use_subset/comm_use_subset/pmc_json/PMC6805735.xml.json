It was first reported in 2012, and causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatality rate of approximately 35% [1]. The virus is endemic in dromedary camels across the Middle East, Africa and parts of South Asia [2]. However, zoonotic transmission from camels to humans has been reported only in the Middle East [3]. Differences in human\u2013animal contact patterns, camel husbandry and production, and viral genetics have all been proposed as possible reasons for the apparent disparity in regional zoonotic risk [3]. Little is known about MERS-CoV dynamics within the dromedary camel reservoir, and what impact these dynamics might have on the risk of zoonotic transmission.",

MERS-CoV incidence, an important measure of infection dynamics and transmission risk, is difficult to estimate in dromedary camels because the infection is often subclinical or very mild and thus easy to miss [9]. Previous studies have suggested that suckling and recently weaned calves have the highest incidence, shed more virus and are the drivers of MERS-CoV circulation among dromedaries. As a result, these animals are presumably a higher risk source for zoonotic transmission, whether through direct contact or indirectly through localised transfer to the dam's milk and subsequent consumption of contaminated raw camel milk [10, 11]. These conclusions are drawn primarily from a small number of longitudinal studies [6\u201312] and age-stratified prevalence data, where the trend points towards low seroprevalence and higher prevalence of active infection in calves as compared to older age groups [6\u201313].",

FOI can be estimated from disease prevalence data [15], and the product of FOI and the number of susceptible individuals will yield estimated incidence [16]. Previous studies on other pathogens have used prevalence data to estimate FOI and derive incidence in a population of interest [17], and FOI has been used as a metric for comparison of disease burden spatially and temporally [18, 19]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate FOI for MERS-CoV in dromedary camels. FOI can also be used to estimate the reproductive number of the pathogen in a population (the average number of secondary infections resulting from the introduction of an infectious individual into a completely susceptible population) [20, 21], and as a parameter in disease transmission models [22].",

The study area consisted of the five main camel-producing counties in Kenya, as determined previously [23], excluding those where travelling and sampling were not possible due to security concerns (Fig. 1). A multi-level sampling strategy was employed. The overall sample size was 1421 camels from 83 herds, with a probability sampling of herds from each county (Table 1). Approximately one-third of sublocations (the lowest administrative unit) were randomly selected from each county. A list of households and the number of camels owned in each selected sublocation was used as the sampling frame. The number of herds sampled in each sublocation was proportional to the total number of herds in that administrative unit. Age was divided into four categories: 0\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20133 and >3 years of age. Within each herd, camels were sampled conveniently with attention that all age groups and both sexes were represented. All camels were sampled in herds 10 or smaller, 10\u201320 camels were sampled in herds between 11 and 50 animals, and 20 camels were sampled in herds larger than 50.\n\n",

The overall individual-level seroprevalence was 63.7% (95% confidence interval 61.2\u201366.2%). At the herd level, 86.7% of herds had at least one seropositive camel (95% CI 79.5\u201394.0%) while the mean seroprevalence within all herds was 57.6% (95% CI 50.8\u201364.4%). Table 2 shows seroprevalence by county, age, sex and production system. Differences in seroprevalence can be seen across the different factors, perhaps most strikingly between counties and production systems. Two counties (Nakuru and Laikipia) contained all ranching herds, while only a few pastoral herds were sampled in Laikipia, and none in Nakuru. The seroprevalence levels by county and production system are consistent with this clustering. Furthermore, ranching herds tended to be smaller. The average herd size was 77 camels, with no herds having more than 200 camels. Pastoral herds by comparison had an average herd size of 128 camels. Ranch had less contact with other animals including camels, livestock and wildlife (data not shown). Conversely, age and sex were similarly distributed among the two production systems. For these reasons and due to a large difference in seroprevalence, production system appeared to be an important characteristic in camel raising and MERS-CoV transmission, and was the basis for exploring FOI separately in ranching and pastoral herds.\n",

            "text": "Among pastoral herds, the highest FOI was among the oldest age group (>3 years old). This is in contrast to previous surveys which have found the highest proportion of shedding to be among calves [6], suggesting that the youngest age group are at highest risk of infection [12]. There are a few possible reasons why this FOI analysis identified the oldest age group as having the highest risk of infection based on model AIC. Questions remain as to whether antibodies to MERS-CoV wane after first infection, and if and to what degree camels are susceptible to reinfection [3\u201312, 13\u201327]. The FOI analysis presented in this paper used serological data, not virological results. If seroconversion does not necessarily occur after the first infection, or antibodies wane following a single infection, then the risk profile seen in this analysis as well as in previous studies may reflect a more complex immunological picture, where, for example, seroconversion occurs after subsequent infections (occurring in older camels) [13\u201328]. Furthermore, the oldest age group has a much larger age range than the others, and therefore represents a greater cumulative risk. Although more detailed age demographic data were not collected during this survey, previous work in pastoral herds in northern Kenya has reported that breeding females live to an average of 19 years, and that breeding bulls (1\u20134 in each herd) are culled at about 17 years old [29]. Male calves, however, are either slaughtered shortly after birth, or at about 4 years of age [30]. Previous research has shown that dams of suckling calves also shed MERS-CoV [11]. Female camels typically have their first calf between 4 and 5 years of age [31], placing dams, potentially one of the higher-risk demographic groups, in the oldest age group. The lack of detailed age demographics of the herds sampled in the survey precluded an estimation of the midpoint of the oldest age category, but it is presumably higher than the 3.5 years used in this study. A higher age midpoint would result in different model FOI estimations and AIC values.",

The FOI was consistently lower in ranching herds than pastoral herds, by a factor of at least 10 when comparing the models with the best fit. This is consistent with previous studies, where the production system has been demonstrated to be a significant factor in MERS-CoV seroprevalence in camels [28]. However, a previous study of camel herds in Laikipia County, Kenya found no statistical difference in seroprevalence based on herd management strategy [32]. There are numerous factors that clustered by production system which may contribute to the difference in infection risk, including county. Camel density at the county level is lower where ranching herds are found [23], and given that MERS-CoV is transmitted by close contact between camels, regional density, which could be related to production system, may be a factor that impacts virus transmission. Indeed, regional camel density was found to correlate with seroprevalence in a previous study of Kenyan camel herds, although production systems clustered geographically in this study as well [33]. Other factors that clustered with production system were related to herd management and husbandry. According to data collected in this survey, pastoral herds only used communal water sources, while ranching herds mostly kept herds within a fenced area (data not shown). Both of these management characteristics affect contact with other (potentially infectious) animals. Indeed, all herds in this study that lacked a perimeter fence had daily contact with other camels, while fenced herds did not. Production system may impact infection risk for many reasons, including herd-level factors and county-level factors. The data from pastoral herds best fit an age-dependent model, while ranching herd data fit the age-independent model. This may reflect differences in herd management and structure, or this difference may be due to a small sample size of ranching herds.",

These FOI estimates provide another perspective on MERS-CoV dynamics and a metric for infection risk in the dromedary camel reservoir, which can be used to estimate incidence, as a parameter in transmission models, and as a point of comparison between different camel populations. Within a one-health context, the results described here can also help to inform zoonotic transmission risk assessment, human surveillance and other MERS-CoV activities at the camel\u2013human interface.",
