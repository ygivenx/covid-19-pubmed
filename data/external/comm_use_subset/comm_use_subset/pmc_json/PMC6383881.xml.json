            "text": "Spray-dried animal plasma (SDAP) is a protein source widely used in pig feed due to its functional components able to improve post-weaning performance and survival [1,2]. The manufacturing process of SDAP involves the collection of blood from healthy animals at a commercial abattoir that have been inspected by veterinary officials and passed as fit for slaughter for human consumption. Immediately after collection, the blood is treated with an anticoagulant, chilled, transported to the manufacturing plant and centrifuged to obtain plasma and blood cell fractions. Alternatively, the blood can be centrifuged at the abattoir and the plasma fraction is chilled and transported to the manufacturing plant. At the manufacturing plant, the plasma is concentrated by membrane filtration and spray-dried, achieving 80\u00b0C throughout its substance [2]. The process for the production of SDAP has been validated to effectively inactivate many viral and bacterial pathogens [3\u201314]. These data demonstrate that commercially produced SDAP is a safe feed ingredient. However, it is appropriate to evaluate new technology that could be included into the manufacturing process representing added redundant microbial inactivation steps. Typical plasma manufacturing plants are capable of processing between 25,000 mt to 450,000 mt of liquid plasma annually.",

            "text": "Many different techniques have been used to inactivate or remove viruses from human plasma products, i.e. intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). For example, solvent/detergent mixtures have been effectively used to inactivate lipid enveloped viruses [15]. However, this process requires significant volume of solvent/detergent mixtures that must be removed and disposed. Enveloped viruses can be inactivated by the addition of unsaturated fatty acids [16], or caprylic acid in combination with low pH and temperature [17,18]. While many of these methods are very effective for plasma fractions (purified immunoglobulins or albumin) these methods are not appropriate for the production of SDAP because these processes result in many denatured plasma proteins. As a rule, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to inactivation than enveloped viruses [19]. An alternative to inactivation is removal of the virus from plasma fractions by nanofiltration [20]. However, this is not a practical option for industrial production of SDAP since the volume of product to be processed is very large and most proteins are retained in the retentate. Similarly, other removal procedures used in the human plasma industry, like precipitation or chromatography are impractical due to the large volumes used by SDAP manufacturing industry.",

Such methodology uses a shortwave electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 254 nm (range of 250 and 270 nm), which induces damage in the nucleic acids. UV-C radiation disrupts DNA and RNA [22], and is therefore effective at inactivating a wide range of microorganisms. In fact, it has been extensively used for disinfection of water, surfaces and food products [23,24]. The inability of UV-C radiation to penetrate opaque liquids can be overcome by introducing adequate turbulence insuring that all of the liquid is exposed to the surface of the UV-C light [25\u201330]. UV-C treatment has been shown to reduce bacterial contamination while not inactivating protein functionality or growth enhancing properties of SDAP [31]. SurePure has designed a UV-C treatment system that is able to reduce the pathogen burden in milk, fruit juices, etc. [26,28,29].",

Inside the spiral tube is an UV-C 254 nm wavelength germicidal lamp of 100-Watt (W) output (30 W UV-C output) protected by a quartz sleeve. The liquid flows between the corrugated spiral tube and the quartz sleeve.

The liquid is pumped at a minimum flow rate of 4000 L/h with a Reynolds value in excess of 7500 (Reynolds number > 2,600 indicates a turbulent flow).",

For example, all three samples of SVDV at 6000 J/L were negative by the microtiter assay. However, the subsequent 3 blind passages performed for each 6000 J/L sample were positive. Afterwards, a titration of 25 mL was done by duplicate, obtaining one positive out of 960 wells, so, it was concluded that there were 0.02 particles/mL (0.014 TCID50%) in the 6000 J/L samples (1 particle/50 mL assayed volume). To further confirm the dose required to inactivate SVDV, three additional blind passages were performed for the three samples irradiated at 9000 J/L, and one was found positive. Titration of the original sample of 9000 J/L (25 mL) was done; one out of 480 inoculated wells was positive. It was calculated that 0.04 particles per milliliter (0.028 TCID50%) were still present in the only positive sample of 9000 J/L (1 particle / 25 mL assayed volume). The most resistant virus was PCV-2, since the total log10 reduction achieved was 2.71 log10 at 9000 J/L.",

Animal plasma from slaughterhouse is an opaque liquid; therefore, UV-C radiation does not penetrate this liquid. This problem has been overcome by introducing turbulent flow achieving that the whole volume of liquid passes close to the UV-C radiation source [25\u201330]. The UV-C system used in this work can be expanded to efficiently process large volumes of liquid compatible with commercial production of fruit juices, wine [26,38] and milk [47]. It is important to differentiate this unique design of the SurePure Turbulator system for treatment of high volume of opaque liquids from other UV systems developed for treatment of human plasma fractions [25,27] that are designed for treatment of small plasma fraction bags under gentle agitation but cannot be scalable to the volumes used by the commercial SDAP industry.",

Enveloped viruses could not be detected when the UV-C dose was >3000 J/L. The best fit lines describing inactivation kinetics of the enveloped viruses were curvilinear biphasic equations. This could be due to lack of more points of collection; in many cases the last data point(s) appeared to be beyond the minimum UV-C radiation required to inactivate the entire virus in the sample, creating an apparent curvilinear shape. Cutler et al, [50] reported biphasic inactivation kinetics of PRRSV, BVDV and SIV using a different UV-C delivery system and with the virus suspended in culture media rather than blood plasma. Although almost a lineal response was observed in the present study, the best model for BVDV was Weibull, and biphasic plus shoulder for SIV. Nevertheless, in both studies, despite using two different irradiation equipment (here versus the used by Cutler et al. [49]), the relative sensitivity of the virus to UV-C inactivation was similar with PRRSV being more sensitive than BVDV or SIV.",

The inactivation curve for PPV was consistent with previously published data [31], with apparent linear inactivation in response to increasing UV-C dose. Likewise, the inactivation curve for SVA appeared to be linear except for the highest UV-C dose. The inactivation curve for SVDV showed minimal inactivation at low UV-C dose, suggesting that a minimal UV-C dose was necessary before virus was inactivated. This has been reported by others [40] who suggested that for some virus inactivation does not occur until a minimum UV-C dose is achieved. However, in this experiment appears to be another shoulder in the inactivation curve at intermediate UV-C dosage (1500 and 3000 J/L). Furthermore, while the highest doses appeared to inactivate all the virus, subsequent passages detected very low residual viral infectivity. The inactivation curve for PCV-2 demonstrated that UV-C radiation inactivated this virus; however, even at the highest dose (9000 J/L), residual levels of PCV-2 were recovered. The presence of a resistant viral subpopulation has been attributed to the ability of some viruses to take advantage of host cell repair mechanisms [52], or in some cases they can code for their own repair machinery [53]. It has also been argued that viral particle clumping, particularly with other cells or debris, may shield some virus from UV-C radiation [50].",

However, based on the present results, increased genome size did not appear to increase virus susceptibility to UV-C radiation when spiked into commercially collected animal plasma and exposed to UV-C. Only a weak linear trend (r2 = 0.43) was found in the current data when comparing genome size to the 4D of viruses (without outlier\u2019s results PEDV and PRV). Curiously, Wang et al. [25] found that viruses with large genomes (Adenovirus and Reovirus) were inactivated with higher UV-C doses than viruses with shorter genomes. These authors indicated that their unexpected survival curves compared with other UV-C irradiation studies was difficult to explain, and suggested differences in the shape, size and lamp geometry of UV-irradiation systems as well as in protein concentrations and composition of process streams to explain their results. Also, genome configuration may affect the virus sensitivity to UV-C radiation. For example, both PPV and PCV-2 have a relatively small genome size (5.07 and 1.77 Kb, respectively). However, estimated 4D for PPV was 2161 J/L while that for PCV-2 was >9000 J/L. It is possible that the linear configuration of PPV genome could be more easily damaged, whereas the circular genome of PCV-2 may provide resistance to the formation of thymidine dimers by UV-C radiation. In any case, the present study should be considered exploratory in nature regarding the relationship between size and type of the genome and susceptibility to inactivation by UV-C irradiation.",

This effect may further explain why enveloped viruses were very susceptible to UV-C irradiation. In fact, in the present study, irradiation doses used were between 30\u2013375 times higher than those described in the literature [59]. These differences could be due to the presence of proteins and other molecules in solution, to the possibility of virus clumping with these molecules, to the greater opacity of the liquid against UV, to the higher basal absorbance and/or to the darker color of the liquid plasma solution compared to other more transparent solution like water or other buffers like PBS. Nevertheless, our results are closer to irradiation values found in other opaque raw materials like milk or juices [26,60].",

Data from the present study indicated that the UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma is a technology that could provide an additional inactivation step to the industrial production process for SDAP. Exposure to UV-C is extensively used for the disinfection of liquid media and surfaces due to its germicidal activity [23,24]. Therefore, UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma during the manufacturing process for SDAP has a potential application for inactivation of microbial contaminants without causing negative effects on the nutritional or physical qualities of the treated material [51,61]. Furthermore, the UV-C mechanism of inactivation (DNA or RNA damage) is different than the thermal inactivation provided by the spray-drying step. In consequence, the UV-C step can be considered independent from the spray-drying process and may be a synergistic process as both procedures have different inactivation targets.",
