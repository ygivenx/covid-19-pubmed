In the 1970s, the first PEDV outbreak occurred in Europe (Wood, 1977). Subsequently, the virus affected many countries such as the Czech Republic, Belgium, Hungary, South Korea, Italy, and Thailand (Song and Park, 2012). Since 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PEDV has occurred in swine herds around China. Then, the emergence of PEDV occurred in Ohio in the United States in 2013, which spread throughout the United States (Huang et al., 2013). Currently, due to lack of effective vaccines, isolation and identification of new PEDV strains to develop appropriate vaccines for prevention and control of the disease have garnered great interest.",

            "text": "PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family (Brian and Baric, 2005). Its genome size is about 28 kb, and it possesses at least seven open reading frames (ORF): ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). PEDV S protein plays a critical role in inducing neutralization antibodies, specific receptor binding, and membrane fusion. In addition, the S gene has shown a high degree of genetic variability. Therefore, it is often used to analyze PEDV genetic variation. According to phylogenetic analysis of S genes, PEDV strains have been divided into two clusters: genome I subtype and genome II subtype (Lee et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Further, several variant PEDV strains have been identified, which were characterized by insertion and deletion (INDEL) in labeled (S) genes named S-INDEL PEDV. The pathogenesis of PEDV is strain specific. Studies on its pathogenesis in piglets suggest that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain has stronger pathogenicity compared to the PEDV S-INDEL strain (Chen et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). PEDV JS-A belongs to the non-S-INDEL strain.",

NF-\u03baB regulates expression of numerous components of the immune system, which is thought to be the hallmark of most infection, including coronaviruses (DeDiego et al., 2014). RNA viruses interact with pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Several in vitro studies have been conducted to clarify the role of PEDV in innate immune responses at the cellular level. Several other studies have determined that PEDV nucleocapsid protein (N) inhibits the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs) (Ding et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2015a; Shan et al., 2018). PEDV non-S-INDEL infection inhibits the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-I by down-regulating TLRs and downstream signaling molecules (Temeeyasen et al., 2018).",

We also studied the gene regulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream signaling pathways in the intestinal mucosa of pigs newly infected with JS-A.

After 1 day of adaptation, piglets in the challenged group received 3 \u00d7 105 TCID50 PEDV JS-A orally, while piglets in the control group received 3 mL maintenance medium orally. The piglets were observed daily for signs of vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, weight, and body temperature until the end of the experiment. Intestinal segments, including the jejunum and ileum, were collected after euthanasia of three of six piglets in each group, selected at random, at 4 dpi for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations using the method described previously (Lee et al., 2010). At the end of the experiment (21 dpi), the remaining piglets were euthanized. Expressions of mRNA for TLRs, NF-\u03baB and FcRn on piglet intestinal mucosa in each group were detected by RT-qPCR at 4 and 21 dpi.",

However, at 21 dpi, TLR4, TLR7, and corresponding downstream MyD88 (subunits A and B) were up-regulated, further up-regulating NF-\u03baB.

Therefore, vaccines made from classical strains cannot provide effective protection, which is consistent with current findings. The PEDV S gene evolutionary tree and homology were further analyzed. The phylogenetic tree was divided into two evolutionary branches, namely G1 and G2 groups. The G1 group contained classic strains such as CV777, DR13, and SM98. The G2 group has been the most prevalent strain since 2010. JS-A, which has been separated this time, also belongs to G2a. This shows that JS-A is indeed the dominant strain in current pig farms.

As expected, vomiting and severe diarrhea were observed in piglets from 1 to 6 dpi, indicating that JS-A was pathogenic to newborn piglets. Fecal swabs were collected from piglets infected with PEDV, and viral fecal shedding was detected by real-time PCR. PEDV RNA was detected from 1 to 14 dpi, suggesting that PEDV infection via fecal-oral contamination may be the main transmission route of piglet diarrhea in pig farms. Previously, it has been reported that coronavirus HKU15 may be transmitted via the respiratory route, in addition to fecal\u2013oral transmission (Woo et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018). Notably, we only observed microlesions in the jejunum and ileum of piglets infected with JS-A, but PEDV infection did not cause death of newborn piglets, despite drowsiness, anorexia, and watery diarrhea in these animals. These results suggest that PEDV JS-A has a milder toxicity and may be a weak strain. At the same time, there were slight differences in body weight and no significant differences in body temperature during infection.",

PEDV has been reported to induce innate immune responses in vivo. However, few studies have been reported. Therefore, in this study, in vivo models were used to further observe the natural TLRs and signaling pathway homeostasis regulated by the gut microbiota. Natural immunity is the first line of host defense against a variety of pathogenic infections (Li et al., 2013). Furthermore, in vitro PEDV N and E protein mediated NF-\u03baB activation and had effects on cell growth and ER stress, upregulating IL-8 expression (Xu et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2015b). However, PEDV non-S-INDEL N and nsp1 protein inhibited NF-\u03baB activation (Ding et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017). MyD88 is an essential component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection in mice in vivo (Totura et al., 2015). The pathogenesis of PEDV is strain specific. The lack of TRAF6 leads to enhanced viral replication and a significant reduction in the production of type I IFN after infection with RNA virus. In vivo, PEDV non-S-INDEL down-regulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through negative regulation of TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, resulting in the final attenuation of MyD88, TRIF, and TRAF6 gene expression (Temeeyasen et al., 2018).",

High levels of serum IgG, IgA, and VN antibodies were also detected in the sera of infected piglets at 21 dpi. In addition, inoculation of piglets with JS-A suppressed FcRn expression via TLR, RIG-I, and NF-\u03baB mRNA expressions at 4 dpi, yet induced FcRn expression at 21 dpi in infected intestinal mucosa. All results showed that innate immunity was suppressed at 4 dpi and that innate immunity might have been activated by the virus at 21 dpi.

(B,D) The mRNA expressions of RIG-I, TRIF, MyD88A, MyD88B, IRF7, TRAF6, NF-kB1 (p105), NF-kB1 (p50), RelA (p65) at the intestinal mucosa from piglets after infection with JS-A at 4dpi (B) and 21dpi (D) by RT-qPCR. All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed as fold changes relative to the control animals Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. Significant difference between PEDV JS-A and control group are expressed with their p. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.",
