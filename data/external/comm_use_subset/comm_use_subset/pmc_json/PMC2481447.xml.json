Fibrin deposition in the alveolar sacs gives rise to a hyaline membrane, and deposition in the microvasculature results in thrombosis [5-14]. Nebulised heparin may limit fibrin deposition in the alveolar space and microcirculation through heparin's anticoagulant and fibrinolytic actions [15-18]. Studies in animal models of ALI have demonstrated that nebulised heparin improved the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and reduced histological damage [19,20]. In addition, in the setting of lung injury triggered by cardiac surgery, a preoperative heparin infusion reduced evidence of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis [21].",
