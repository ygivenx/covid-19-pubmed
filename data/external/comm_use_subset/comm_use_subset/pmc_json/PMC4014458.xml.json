When sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection does occur, it is usually initiated by a single virus, called the founder strain, despite the presence of thousands of genetically diverse viral strains in the transmitting partner [3]. Here we review evidence from molecular biology and virology suggesting that heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells could yield wide variation in the capability of individual cells to become infected and transmit HIV to other cells. Using an epidemiological framework, we suggest that such heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa could help explain the low infection-to-exposure ratio and selection of the founder strain after sexual exposure to HIV.",

At the time of initial exposure to HIV, these CD4+ T cells exhibit baseline heterogeneity due to stochasticity in cellular gene expression [6] and dynamic variation in immunological status (activated, resting, etc.) [7]. In addition, because CD4+ T cells are mobile, they are heterogeneously distributed in the genital mucosa, with varying degrees of clustering and contact [8]\u2013[11]. In other contexts, it is well-known that heterogeneity among isogeneic cells inside the body can affect many cellular behaviors and outcomes, including infection dynamics [12], [13].",

In populations of homogeneous individuals, the distribution of individual reproductive numbers will be clustered around the population average value of R\n0, and thus, this average value will more accurately predict the likelihood of transmission from each infected to each susceptible individual. If R\n0>1, then an outbreak is likely to become an epidemic, and if R\n0<1, then an outbreak will not spread beyond a few initially infected individuals [15], [16].",

In such populations, there is a high probability that a disease outbreak will not be sustained in the population and will instead go extinct [14]. In some cases, however, those rare individuals in the tail of the distribution with a much higher-than-average individual reproductive number while they are infected, known as \u201csuperspreaders\u201d [15], can have a significant impact on whether an outbreak becomes an epidemic or goes extinct. Epidemiological outbreak investigations, which track the spread of disease by a technique called contact tracing, have identified the existence of superspreaders in many well-known infectious disease outbreaks, including typhoid fever, measles, smallpox, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [14], [17], [18]. These rare individuals often make a significant, sometimes deciding, contribution to the dynamics of disease spread (Table 1).",

As with individual humans inside a population, however, empirical evidence indicates that individual human cells inside a population are also heterogeneous [12], varying in their contact with one another, their ability to become infected (permissivity), and also in whether and to what extent they transmit infectious virus to other cells during their infectious period. Such heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa of a single individual could generate a skewed distribution in the individual cellular reproductive number, or ICRN, in the context of HIV infection. Here we review evidence for heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells that could lead to wide variation in ICRN and possibly give rise to cellular superspreaders.",

In addition, various studies that stain for CD4+ T cells in uninfected genital mucosal tissue, such as cervical tissue [27] and human foreskin [22], indicate that T cells vary in their spatial distribution and the extent to which they form clusters. Cell density and spatial arrangement have been identified as important sources of heterogeneity among cells that can affect virus spread in vitro [8], [28]\u2013[30]. Indeed, imaging studies exploring the dynamics of virus spread in a model of sexual transmission to female nonhuman primates indicate that virus spreads unevenly among clusters of cells in the endocervix [9]. Cells in these clusters tend to be in close proximity, and if cell-to-cell transmission is far more efficient than cell-free transmission, as some studies suggest [31], then a cell that is physically touching its neighbors could generate more secondary infections than a cell that is not close enough to others to transmit virus by direct contact [8]. Thus, heterogeneity in cell distribution and clustering inside the body could generate wide variation in the efficiency of virus transmission from cell to cell and in ICRN.",

The level of surface expression of CD4 and CCR5 (the predominant coreceptor utilized during acute infection [32]) varies widely among CD4+ T cells [25], [33], even in a single individual [34], and affects cellular permissivity to HIV [35], [36]. Indeed, low expression of CD4 or CCR5 can completely inhibit infection of CD4+ T cells by certain viral strains [37]. A recent multiparameter analysis of HIV entry efficiency at the level of single cells indicated large cell-to-cell variation in expression of CD4, CCR5, and the coreceptor CXCR4, which subsequently influenced permissivity of individual cells to HIV binding and entry [38]. In addition, CD4+ T cells isolated from rectal and cervical tissue exhibit considerable heterogeneity in expression of the surface integrin \u03b14\u03b27, which can specifically bind the V2 loop of the HIV envelope protein gp120 and may improve cell-to-cell spread by activating other cell-surface molecules in the viral synapse [39]. Experiments in vitro indicate that HIV preferentially infects cells expressing high levels of CCR5 and that infection can be further enhanced by high levels of surface \u03b14\u03b27 expression in some individuals [40], [25]. Heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in expression of specific cell surface receptors can thus affect permissivity and cell-to-cell transfer of HIV infection in the genital mucosa.",

Notably, an intracellular host restriction factor known as SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif [SAM] and histidine/aspartic acid [HD] domain-containing protein 1) blocks reverse transcription in resting\u2014but not activated\u2014CD4+ T cells, inhibiting HIV replication. These findings help to explain the inability of resting CD4+ T cells to produce infectious virus [44].

Activated CD4+ T cells express higher levels of CCR5 [33] and \u03b14\u03b27 [40] than do resting cells. In addition, experiments in nonhuman primates indicate that infected, activated cells contain five times more viral RNA, release 10-fold more viral particles to their surrounding environment, and tend to form larger cell clusters than resting cells [9]. Notably, although the nonhuman primate model has long been used to study many facets of HIV infection [53], the virus used in these experiments, SIV, expresses a protein that allows it to productively infect resting CD4+ T cells. In contrast, HIV-1 does not express this protein and is thus unable to generate productive infection in resting CD4+ T cells [54]. Resting human CD4+ T cells in the human genital mucosa are therefore even less likely to be able to produce and spread HIV than are resting CD4+ T cells in a nonhuman primate model.",

These rare cells may be activated CD4+ T cells, which have been described as \u201camplifiers\u201d that can cause additional cells to become infected with HIV [10], [55]. Such rare cells may exhibit a specific set of traits that facilitate establishment of HIV inside the body. For example, experiments done in vitro indicate that CD4+ Th17 cells, which express high levels of CCR5 as well as the chemokine receptor CCR6 and the integrin \u03b14\u03b27, are preferentially targeted during early infection, and analysis of samples from female sex workers who are infected with HIV indicate that CD4+ Th17 cells are selectively depleted from the cervix during HIV infection [25], [56]\u2013[58]. In addition, given that the majority of HIV infections begin with a single founding strain [59] and most infected cells in peripheral blood and lymph node tissue contain a single copy of HIV DNA (although these may or may not be representative of HIV integration in mucosal lymphatic cells) [51], infection of a single cell has the potential to establish HIV infection inside the genital mucosa after a given exposure. Infection of a rare CD4+ T cell with very high ICRN could thus be the superspreading event that both establishes HIV infection in the genital mucosa and selects a single founder strain (Figure 2B).",

In addition, some HIV-exposed, seronegative humans who continue to engage in high-risk sexual behavior exhibit immunological markers that indicate a prior immune response to HIV infection even though they remain seronegative, supporting the idea that local infections may have occurred in these patients [65]\u2013[67]. Finally, analysis of the unsuccessful HIV vaccine STEP trial suggested that a large portion of the exposed individuals may have experienced occult infection, implying that this phenomenon could be more widespread than previously suspected [68].

Thus, a CD4+ T cell could theoretically become a superspreader either by spreading a large amount of infectious virus to other cells in a short amount of time, or by spreading a smaller amount of virus to other cells for a comparatively longer period of time, or through some combination of the two. Though any of these mechanisms are possible in early infection [79], studies in nonhuman primates suggest that establishment of infection in the genital mucosa typically occurs within 3\u20137 days after male-to-female sexual exposure [62], [80]. The lifespan of a productively infected CD4+ T cell is on average 2.2 days [81]. Thus, in the specific case of HIV infection in the genital mucosal tissue, if infection becomes established via a superspreading event, it is likely to occur within the first few days of exposure and be driven by a relatively short-lived, productively infected cell that generates a much higher-than-average number of secondary infections due to a high shedding rate, or a high contact rate, or both. Notably, as in other superspreading events, establishment of HIV by infection of a cellular superspreader could occur even if the basic reproductive number for the entire population of susceptible cells is low.",

Such cells may have specific traits, such as high expression of surface receptors including CCR5 and possibly also \u03b14\u03b27, that allow them to be identified and targeted by novel therapies to prevent establishment of infection. Several recent studies suggest that Th17 cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, are preferentially infected by early viral strains and selectively depleted from the cervix during HIV infection [58], [25]. We are not aware of in vivo data that explicitly support the existence of cellular superspreaders; nevertheless, the data reviewed here suggest their existence, warranting further empirical research. Identification and targeting of cells most likely to become superspreaders could facilitate the development of preexposure or immediate postexposure therapies that could prevent a local outbreak of HIV inside the genital mucosa from becoming a within-host epidemic that spreads throughout the body [9], [83].",
