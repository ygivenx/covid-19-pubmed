Interactions between pathogens and their wildlife hosts are often complex [4, 5, 6, 7] and require long-term interdisciplinary research to unravel [8, 9, 10]. Human activities can disrupt host- pathogen dynamics [11] and reduce the resilience of wildlife to infection [12, 13, 14]. Hence long-term monitoring of wildlife pathogens from ecosystems where the impact of humans is still relatively small provides a useful benchmark to gage future human-induced changes [15].",

Sapovirus infection in humans is associated with either sporadic cases of gastro-enteritis in children or community-wide outbreaks [16\u201318]. In the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus), the virus is associated with weaning and post-weaning enteritis [19]. The genetic diversity and recombination events observed in sapoviruses may account for their emergence [20].",

Long-term monitoring of spotted hyenas has revealed that this species is host to several viruses [35, 36, 39, 40] and that pathogen infection can be significantly influenced by social and demographic factors, and life history traits [35, 40\u201344].",

Given that enteric viruses, such as sapoviruses, are typically transmitted by the fecal-oral route [16,18] we investigated the effect of three factors (social contact, range size and clan size) that should modulate fecal-oral transmission and hence sapovirus infection risk in spotted hyenas. Spotted hyenas have a ritualized greeting ceremony (Fig 1) during which participants typically sniff and lick each other\u2019s ano-genital region thereby facilitating fecal-oral virus transmission from infected to susceptible clan members. High ranking adult females and their offspring are more often involved in greeting ceremonies than are low ranking adult females and their offspring, and all adult females and their offspring are more often involved in greeting ceremonies than immigrant males [45]. This predicts that \u2018social contact\u2019 mediated transmission should be highest in high ranking females and their offspring, intermediate in low ranking females and their offspring, and lowest among immigrant males, all else being equal.",

In the Serengeti NP, adult and subadult hyenas (i.e. those \u226512 months of age) not only range throughout the approximately 56 km2 of their clan\u2019s territory, but also undertake long distance foraging trips (of approximately 140 km distance round-trip) from their clan territory [46, 47].

Even so, if sapovirus infection induces long-term immunity against re-infection regardless of strain-type, we would expect cubs (i.e. na\u00efve animals) to be more prone to infection than adults, as is the case for coronavirus infection in this species [35].

Adult females with standardized ranks higher or equal to the median standardized rank of 0 were classified as holding high social status, those with standardized ranks below 0 as low social status [43].

Strains from spotted hyena formed a separate sub-group from those obtained from African lions and bat-eared foxes, even within the same sampling year (Fig 2), suggesting that strains circulating in the spotted hyena population are distinct from those in the African lion and bat-eared fox populations. Evidence for a degree of species-specificity in host range is apparent in other viruses of carnivores in the Serengeti ecosystem. Genetically distinct alphacoronavirus variants infect spotted hyenas and sympatric silver-backed jackal during the same year [35], genetically distinct strains of kobuvirus infect domestic dogs and wild carnivores [36], and during the 1993/1994 canine distemper epidemic in the Serengeti NP, genetically distinct strains circulated in non-canids (African lion and spotted hyena) and canids (domestic dog and bat-eared fox) [73]. More extensive characterization of sapovirus strains infecting carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem would clarify their host range and help identify which species in the large carnivore guild are infected with sapovirus. Currently it is not known whether or not domestic dogs and domestic cats in Africa are infected with sapovirus.",

Clearly we would have detected far less genetic diversity in our partial RdRp gene sequence data had our sampling of spotted hyenas been limited to a time frame of one or two years (Fig 2), and particularly if sampling was (by chance) only undertaken during non-outbreak years when infection prevalence was low (Fig 3). Samples obtained during outbreak years revealed considerable genetic diversity; for example from 2006 to 2007 we obtained sequence data from five different variants, including the distinct 2007 variant (KT777556) which was the least similar to all others from this host species. As we were not able to sequence data from all RT-PCR positive samples, we cannot exclude the possibility that the genetic diversity among spotted hyena strains was higher than our results indicate. Even so, in line with a previous study [74], our result show that sequence data from the non-structural RdRp gene yields useful information on the genetic diversity of circulating sapovirus strains.",

            "text": "Some outbreaks of sapovirus infection in humans can be linked to the emergence of specific genotypes [18, 75, 76], suggesting that herd immunity against prevailing genotypes may be evaded by the emergence of genetically novel strains. Our long-term monitoring of sapovirus infection in spotted hyenas revealed significant changes in yearly prevalence during the study (Fig 3) and the occurrence of three outbreaks of infection. The highest infection prevalence (above 72.4%) occurred during an outbreak from 2002 to 2004, whereas infection prevalence in two later outbreaks (from 2006 to 2007 and in 2010) was considerably lower. Presumably the 2002/2004 sapovirus outbreak induced herd immunity to the genetic strains that circulated in spotted hyenas during this period, but our phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2) did not reveal the emergence of genetically distinct strains in response to this. Even so, our partial sapovirus RdRp gene sequence data are insufficient to draw strong conclusions. For this, a more extensive genetic investigation is needed, particularly using the VP1 gene used to place sapoviruses in genogroups [16, 21], that may reflect the antigenic relationships between sapovirus [77]. Overall sapovirus infection prevalence in spotted hyenas (34.8%) in the Serengeti NP was several magnitudes higher than the prevalence reported for the domestic dog (< 2%) [26, 72] and the bat H. pomona (1.6%) [28]. Moreover, our long-term monitoring reveals that infection prevalence in spotted hyenas was typically high, being above 20% in most years (Fig 3).",

Several animals transitioned from positive to negative, and we interpret this to indicate that they successfully cleared the virus following infection. If, following an initial infection, spotted hyenas gained long-term immunity against further infection, infection prevalence should decline with age. As prevalence amongst adults reached almost 50% during outbreak years, our results do not provide strong evidence for long-term immunity in this species (Table 1). Even so, we found no individual that changed from RT-PCR positive to negative to positive (Table 2) which would have provided direct evidence of re-infection. During outbreaks of sapovirus in humans and pigs, cases of re-infection with sapovirus belonging to different genogroups have been reported in both species, suggesting genogroup-specific immunity for sapoviruses [74, 79, 80]. More extensive investigation of the genetic diversity across strains circulating in our spotted hyena population is needed to determine whether sapovirus strains induce (1) short-term immunity, which would permit re-infection with strains from the same sapovirus genogroup, (2) genogroup-specific immunity, in which re-infection would involve strains from different genogroups, or (3) possibly a complex interplay between the two, as hypothesized for the genetically and antigenically diverse Norovirus which is closely related to the Sapovirus genus[81, 82].",

Taken together, these results suggest that when a spotted hyena is infected, infection is cleared, and reinfection is unlikely within a period of several months, which is consistent with the idea that exposure to sapovirus does not provide long-term immunity against further infection. In humans, sapovirus shedding often subsided 14 days after the onset of illness [83], but can persist for up to 38 days [74]. Hence, we speculate that the spotted hyenas which were positive on two sampling dates several months apart were animals that were re-infected rather than individuals with persistent long-term infections. However, currently we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be spotted hyenas that shed sapoviruses for periods spanning several months.",

            "text": "Spotted hyena social and ranging behavior has been shown to structure transmission routes and the likelihood of infection by a broad range of pathogens [35, 41\u201344]. Yet when we tested whether these two factors influenced sapovirus infection in this species, neither the predicted effect of contact rates based on known patterns of greeting ceremonies, nor the extent of an individual\u2019s range significantly influenced the likelihood of infection in our study population (Table 3). Clan size was a significant factor, but contrary to our expectation, the likelihood of infection declined with increasing clan size. This phenomenon is known in the behavioral literature as the attack-abatement effect [84] or as the encounter-reduction effect [48, 85, 86]. In multi-species host assemblages the same phenomenon in the ecological literature is termed a \u2018dilution\u2019 effect. At least five non-exclusive mechanisms have been identified [49] that can cause a reduction in infection incidence as the number of host species increases, but not all of them are relevant to intraspecific sapovirus infections in spotted hyenas. We have no evidence that sapovirus infection increases the death rate of infected individuals (mechanism 1), as no obvious clinical signs are associated with sapovirus infection in most spotted hyenas. Although we lack a precise measure of the recovery rate (mechanism 2), the general absence of obvious clinical signs of sapovirus infection suggest that the recovery rate is already very high, so that a change in this factor is likely to be modest. A decrease in the density of susceptible individuals (mechanism 3) is unlikely unless this results from a substantial increase in the proportion of clan members immune to sapovirus infection, even if immunity is relatively transient. A substantial increase in the prevalence of immune clan members would result in far fewer sapovirus susceptible individuals. Moreover, such an increase in herd immunity would probably also lead to a decrease in the prevalence of sapovirus excreting clan members, thereby reducing the probability of: (1) sapovirus transmission per encounter (mechanism 4) between clan members and (2) the encounter rate between susceptible and infectious individuals (mechanism 5) in a clan. Further research and more detailed modeling of the interplay between clan size and the prevalence of clan members in different sapovirus infection states (susceptible, infected/excreting virus, and immune) is required to test this idea.",

Moreover, sapovirus typically infects intestinal tissue and to our knowledge is not known to infect other tissues, as illustrated by the absence of viral RNA in any extra-intestinal tissues in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with PEC Cowden [87]. However, in a few dead spotted hyenas (typically road casualties) from which we opportunistically obtained tissue samples, we detected sapovirus RNA most often in the spleen and occasionally also in lymph nodes, intestines and the liver. To our knowledge this is the first report of sapovirus RNA in extra-intestinal tissues following natural infections. The possibility that sapoviruses disseminate to extra-intestinal tissues may be of clinical importance [88]. Notably, in asymptomatic mice shedding murine norovirus in feces, viral RNA was also found in several extra-intestinal organs, including the liver, spleen and lymph nodes [89].",

For example, serological surveys documented that African lions [90] and spotted hyenas in the Serengeti ecosystem were exposed to FCV [91] with a high prevalence. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the variants we report from wild carnivores in Africa are distinct from both FCV and canine calicivirus (Fig 2). A norovirus (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae), genetically related to human noroviruses was reported from a captive African lion [92] and subsequently identified in domestic dogs and domestic cats [93, 94]. Combining these findings with our results suggests that the spotted hyena and African lion can be infected by viruses belonging to three different genera of the family Caliciviridae.",

Sapovirus prevalence in the spotted hyenas varied between years and was not influenced by age.
