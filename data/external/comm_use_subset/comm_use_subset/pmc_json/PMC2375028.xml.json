Microarrays are particularly attractive for the recognition of pathogens in clinical material since current diagnostic assays are typically restricted to the detection of single targets by real-time PCR or immunological assays. Furthermore, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of these signatures can require downstream sequencing of genomic regions. Many microarrays have already been produced with the aim of characterizing the spectrum of micro-organisms present in a sample, including detection of known viruses [1-5], assessment of bioterrorism [6,7] and monitoring food quality [8].",

There are a huge number of diverse species in nature, of which we have sequence information for only a tiny fraction. This makes it difficult to find oligonucleotides, either alone or in combination, that uniquely identify species of interest. Oligos may have homology to multiple species, which results in a complex and noisy hybridization pattern. Secondly, each nucleic acid sample tested will typically contain a mixture of DNA and RNA from the organism of interest, the host and from a variety of contaminants, which may all contribute to the resulting microarray profile. Furthermore, this may be complicated by the presence of multiple, possibly related, pathogen species, making it difficult to separate patterns due to cross-hybridization from a true positive result.",

E-Predict uses a matrix of theoretical hybridization energy profiles calculated by BLAST-ing completely sequenced viral genomes against the oligos on their array, and calculating a free energy of hybridization. Observed hybridization profiles are then compared to the theoretical profiles using a similarity metric, and a p value calculated using a set of experimentally obtained null probability distributions. E-Predict has been shown to produce useful results in a number of situations. However, at present, E-Predict does not contain any tools for visualization, and requires extensive customization and calculation before it is applicable to new arrays. Also, E-Predict is only available as a CGI script for Unix/Linux platforms.",

An example in pathogen detection data may be species, genus, family, and so on. The data are sorted into unique groups as defined by the unique values of group. A barplot is drawn, with one bar per unique probe. Probes from the same group are drawn together. Each group is represented by a unique background color, enabling the user to easily visualize the different groups. An example output is shown in Figure 2. This sample comes from Urisman et al [9] and represents data from a virus detection microarray hybridized with amplified RNA from nasal lavage, positive for respiratory syncytial virus by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test.

The reason we have highlighted this array, however, is that the result for Enterobacteria phage M13 shows a higher mean normalized intensity than any of the rhinovirus groups. This is representative of a class of result from DetectiV whereby a virus group has a higher mean normalized log ratio, but a larger p value, than the top hit.

In this particular instance, Enterobacteria phage M13 is represented by 10 oligos, all of which have intensities far greater than the global median, but which vary considerably between 982 and 18,864.

            "text": "Despite these problems, many species detection arrays have been developed [1-5]. However, reliable methods of data analysis have been rare. Initial methods included visual inspection of the array [4] and clustering [18], both of which are subjective and time-consuming. To combat this, Urisman et al. [9] have proposed a more robust method, E-Predict. E-Predict utilizes a pre-calculated energy matrix for each oligo on the array and uses a variety of normalization and similarity metrics to calculate a p value and similarity for each virus. The advantages of E-Predict are that it is quantitative, produces good results and is extensible, through the extension of the energy matrix. The disadvantages of the software are a lack of visualization tools, the need to customize parameters for different array platforms and hybridization conditions, and the availability of the software only as a CGI script on the Unix/Linux platform.",

DetectiV uses simple and well established visualization and statistical techniques to analyze data from pathogen detection microarrays. DetectiV offers a powerful visualization option in the form of a barplot, enabling researchers to quickly and easily identify possible infectious agents. Data can then normalized to a negative control (be that a specific probe, array or the global median), transformed by taking the log2 and then subjected to a t-test for each species on the array. Oligos are allowed to represent any number of viruses, and thus any analysis is easily extensible by simply updating the list of which oligos represent which species.",

A statistically significant result may be obtained by a group of oligos that display intensities only marginally larger than the negative control (in this case the global median intensity). This is demonstrated by human herpesvirus 5 on array GSM40820 (Table 3). However, we know that from a biological perspective, we would expect to see intensities far higher than the negative control, and that intensities only marginally higher result from low homology between the probe and the sample. We can therefore use the statistical significance (p value) in combination with our idea of biological significance (the mean normalized log ratio) to successfully call the correct result in over 98% of the arrays.",

However, this does require careful interpretation. Both DetectiV and E-Predict predict multiple, significant matches on all of the arrays. When using DetectiV, it is only when looking for major changes between the top hit and subsequent hits, in terms of p value or mean log ratio, that it is possible to separate the true positives from the false positives. In many cases, using automatic rules will result in the correct result; however, there will inevitably be borderline cases where human inspection of the results is required. This is all the more important when considering the possible economic impacts of a false positive for certain species. At present, the safest way to employ such arrays, and their analysis methods, may be simply as a first step towards identifying infectious agents, informing researchers about which viruses they should test for using more conventional methods.",

However, using a simple NCBI blast search, it was possible to extend the range of viruses covered by the array to include SARS - 61 existing oligos showing significant homology to the SARS genome. On application of DetectiV to the updated data, SARS was the top hit. Not only does this offer the promise of being able to extend the coverage of the array without adding further oligos, it also suggests that it is possible to detect viruses without having any unique oligos. This may inform the oligo selection process - it may be equally desirable to have multiple, non-unique oligos to represent a species as it is to have a few that are unique.",

It should be noted that in order to apply DetectiV to a second dataset from a completely different array to the first dataset, the user only has to change the GEO accession number and the number of arrays within that dataset. This compares favorably with E-Predict, which would require a separate training dataset from the second array, the calculation of a large and complex sequence similarity matrix and the optimization of several parameters.",

In terms of visualization, better browsing capabilities of the barplots would be desirable, perhaps using a web-interface. In terms of the analysis, we may borrow ideas from gene expression arrays. For example, limma uses an empirical Bayes method to shrink each gene's standard error towards a common value, and has been shown to perform better than standard statistical methods [12]. It may be that we can apply a similar method here to shrink the standard error for each virus species towards a common value, thus increasing sensitivity. It may also be possible to apply multiple-testing procedures to the resulting p values. The Bonferroni correction may be appropriate, in which the p values are multiplied by the number of comparisons, or a more conservative approach may be needed, such as that suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [19], in order to control the false discovery rate.",
