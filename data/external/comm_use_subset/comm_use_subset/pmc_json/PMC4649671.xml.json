The software uses a sophisticated algorithm to select an optimal nearby partner SNP for each anchor SNP based on the correlation between the two SNPs. In simulation studies, the program successfully identified causal variants which would otherwise be missed by the conventional single-SNP analysis17. In this study, all variants in our GWAS dataset were subject to SnipSnip analysis. As shown in Figure 2, SnipSnip implementation substantially increased the association signals compared to the traditional single-SNP analysis. Interestingly, the top 4 causal variants were mapped to C8B and LGALS1 (Table 2), the identical genes discovered in single-SNP analysis as top candidates. The artificial imputation (AI) P value (6.72 \u00d7 10\u22128) of the top association signal, a variant of C8B, marginally met the genome-wide significance threshold; while the AI P values of the next three variants, which were mapped to LGALS1, fell at 10\u22127 level. Despite the failure to achieve genome-wide significance for variants of LGALS1, our results did yield variants with higher statistical significance than would be expected by chance as shown in Q-Q plot of our data (supplementary Figure 1). The two C8B variants, rs1960384 (the top SNP) and rs646606 (the anchor SNP) are both intronic SNPs. There has been little evidence implicating the functional alteration related to these two variants. On contrary, the anti-influenza activity of LGALS1 has been demonstrated in a recent study18. In this study, three out of the top four association variants from SnipSnip analysis were mapped to LGALS1. Therefore, we focused on LGALS1 to explore the possible functional mechanism underlying the genetic associations.",

Among the three anchor SNPs, rs4820294 and rs62236673 were in high LD in our study participants (r2 = 0.98) and other populations (r2 = 1.0, Figure 1), indicating the anchor/partner pair rs4820294/rs2899292 and rs62236673/rs2899292 captured the identical causal variant. We chose one pair rs4820294/rs2899292 for further analysis. The causal variant captured by SnipSnip analysis was represented as an anchor/partner pair, which are in weak LD with causal variant but can optimally capture the association signal for the latter. Although AI P values of causal variants are illustrated in Table 2, we are unaware of their distribution in the patient and control group; neither can we postulate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the associations. Now that the anchor and partner SNP are in weak LD with the causal variant, we inferred the distribution of the causal variant by haplotype analysis of the anchor and partner SNP although the association and distribution of anchor/partner haplotypes as surrogate for those of non-genotyped causal variant may be an underestimation17. We simulated the association signal of the causal variant by haplotype analysis of anchor/partner pair rs4820294/rs2899292. As shown in Table 3, due to the LD between rs4820294 and rs2899292 (Figure 1; A(H7N9)), the haplotype AA was rarely present in our study subjects with an overall frequency of less than 2%. The strongest association signal was haplotype GG, which was significantly overrepresented in controls (35.58%) than in A(H7N9) patients (14.33%). The odds ratio of 0.26 for haplotype GG with the liability to infection can be translated into a more comprehensible interpretation that carriers of this haplotype were conferred 3.84 (95% CI, 2.24\u20136.58) fold of protection from A(H7N9) infection compared with non-carriers (P = 5.92 \u00d7 10\u22127). The approximation of the P value of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG to the AI P value of rs4820294/rs2899292 (2.13 \u00d7 10\u22127) suggested that the haplotype GG can appropriately simulate the signal of causal variant represented by SNP pair rs4820294/rs2899292. The identification of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG was literally an advantage of SnipSnip over other commonly-used imputation softwares since SnipSnip can capture the association signals when they derive from a genuine haplotype effect but not to the effect of any ungenotyped single-locus variant.",

We inferred that rs4820294 and its related variants might affect the expression regulation of LGALS1. We retrieved LGALS1 mRNA expression data of lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) from 74 Chinese individuals from Genevar (GENe Expression VARiation) eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) database19, and corresponding genotyping data from 1000 Genomes Project, to assess the possible haplotype-expression correlation. We found that rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG exhibited higher LGALS1 mRNA expression in these 74 LCLs. The LGALS1 mRNA level in LCLs significantly correlated to the carriage status of haplotype GG, i.e., homozygous-, heterozygous- and non-carriage, by linear regression analysis (P = 0.050, Figure 4a & Table 3). To verify the haplotype-expression correlation in the protein level, we chose 21 LCLs with three distinct carriage statuses of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG and examined intracellular LGALS1 protein expression levels by flow cytometry analysis. Consistent with the result of eQTL mapping, LCLs carrying homozygous haplotype GG exhibited the highest levels of LGALS1 protein (Figure 4b, P = 0.025). Therefore, the higher LGALS1 expression level of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG may represent the molecular underpinning for its genetic association with the resistance to A(H7N9) infection.",

As shown in Figure 3, the region harboring rs2071769 and rs34195652 has been defined as a strong regulatory region according to the experimental evidence of ENCODE Consortium. According to the functional annotation of HaploReg 2, the indel alters the regulatory motif of many putative transcription factors. It has been demonstrated that the eQTLs proximate to the transcription start size tend to be more conserved cross cell types and have stronger effect19.

The protective allele A was over-represented in control group (29.3%) than in patient group (10.8%) with an odds ratio of 0.29, which can be translated into 3.41 fold higher protection from A(H7N9) infection to carriers of the allele A than the non-carriers. Actually, rs13057866 A allele can mark rs4820294/rs2899292 GG haplotype due to the complete linkage between rs13057866 and rs4820294 (D' = 1.0) in all the queried populations (our cohort, ASN, AMR and CHB) as well as the high LD between rs13057866 and rs2899292 in our study cohort (D' = 0.92) and other populations (D' \u2265 0.74, Figure 1). Specifically, rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants form a high LD block in the regulatory region of LGALS1 (Figure 1). Based on experimental evidence of ENCODE, most of these variants are functional (supplementary Table 2). Namely, the variants aggregated in the regulatory region form a functional haplotype which may affect LGALS1 gene expression. As mentioned above, the standard imputation in the region accommodating LGALS1 failed to obtain any variant with dramatically increased association signal than rs13057866. Therefore, the \u201cnon-genotyped causal variant\u201d captured by SnipSnip implementation is unlikely a single-locus variant. Instead, the functionally haplotype(s) tagged by rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants are the real causal variants which generated the strong association signals in SnipSnip implementation (Table 2). Collectively, integrating our experimental findings and data mining from the public databases, we demonstrated that rs4820294, rs13057866 and their high LD variants may jointly encode LGALS1 expression variations, thereby caused the differential susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection among humans.",

In contrast with single-SNP association, pathway-based analysis examines groups of functionally related genes, each of which may have too small effect to be detected individually, but can be detectable when analyzed as a functional group. In our study, all the variants with P < 0.001 were mapped to 536 unique genes with ANNOVAR23, which were then applied to a WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt)24. WebGestalt was used to identify the enriched pathways in association with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection in Kyoto Encyclopedia of the Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway collection, which consists of 390 well-defined categories. The top two hits were the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (Table 4). For example, there are totally 85 reference genes in the ECM-receptor category. Among our gene set of 536 genes, 8 polymorphic genes fell in this category while the expected number is 1.03 by chance. After correction for the multiple tests, the ECM-receptor network represents a significantly enriched category with an enrichment ratio of 7.76 and an adjusted P value of 0.0008. Similarly, 12 genes in our gene set were components of MAPK signaling pathway with the enrichment ratio of 3.69 (adjusted P value = 0.0045). Therefore, the gene set analysis suggested that ECM-receptor interaction and MAPK signaling were the significantly enriched pathways associated with the increased susceptibility to the A(H7N9) infection.",

GWAS has been successfully performed to identify the genetic variations associated with the development of human diseases in an unbiased approach25. However, the stringent genome-wide significance threshold and the modest genetic effect size may mask the real associations26. Both experimental and computational data support the notion that a considerable proportion of trait-associated loci harbor variations that impact the abundance of specific transcripts27. These expression-related variations are referred as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which have been mapped by paralleled genome-wide analysis of gene expression and genetic variations in LCLs28 and various human tissues2029. The local eQTLs (cis-eQTLs) refer to those within 1 Mb to the regulated gene. cis-eQTLs tend to have larger effect on gene expression than distant eQTLs (trans-eQTLs)29. The availability of systematically generated eQTLs has been widely leveraged to prioritize the discovery of GWAS, facilitate the identification of causal genes and provide insight into the biological basis for the identified disease associations2030. In this study, the identification of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG and rs4820294 as eQTLs for LGALS1 in LCLs and primary human cells adequately substantiates their genetic association with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection.

A recent study demonstrated that LGALS1 can bind to various subtypes of influenza A viruses, inhibiting viral infectivity and viral production. The mouse experiments showed that treatment with LGALS1 reduced viral load, attenuated lung inflammation and increased mouse survival. Moreover, the LGALS1-knockout mice were more susceptible to the fatal influenza infection than wild-type mice18. According to a public database Genevestigator, human LGALS1 is highly expressed in plasma, variety of cells and tissues, including upper and lower respiratory epithelium. The highly expressed LGALS1 in bronchial epithelial cells displayed considerable variations among 215 humans. In this study, we demonstrated that genetic variants of LGALS1, including rs4820294 and rs13057866 and the related variants, encode the higher expression of LGALS1 in humans, which may confer the carriers of these variants more protection from A(H7N9) infection.",

The extracellular matrix consists of a complex mixture of functional macromolecules and provides structural and functional support to the surrounding cells, including proteoglycans, non-proteoglycan polysaccharide, collagens, fibronectin and laminin etc. The ECM interacts with transmembrane receptors to mediate cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. For example, fibronectins bind collagen and cell-surface integrins, re-organize cell cytoskeleton to facilitate cell movement. ECM and interacting proteins have been implicated in the entry of various viruses including gamma-retrovirus, hepatitis B virus and rhabdovirus3233. Specific components in ECM-receptor interaction pathway have been implicated in the host-virus interaction of influenza viruses. A recent study demonstrated the requirement of fibronectin for the entry of influenza A virus34. Additionally, a focal adhesion kinase links actin reorganization and thereby regulates influenza A virus entry and replication35. The apoptosis signaling modulated influenza A viruses to enable viral replication has been extensively elucidated36. Collectively, cellular activities such as adhesion, dynamic behaviors and apoptosis, which are regulated by ECM-receptor interaction, can affect the entry or replication of influenza viruses and thereby influence the predisposition to human A(H7N9) infection.",

Host genes or biological pathways required for viral entry and viral replication have been identified143839. The essential role of MAPK signaling pathway for the replication of influenza A viruses has been explicitly demonstrated38. Influenza virus inoculation in transgenic mice with over-activated MAPK pathway resulted in increased disease symptoms and higher mortality40. Additionally, specific inhibitors for MAPK pathway displayed antiviral activity against influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo41. The inbred mice study revealed that host genetic components controlling viral replication dynamics was primarily responsible for the host susceptibility to H5N1 diseases37. In this GWAS, the identification of MAPK signaling pathway as the significantly enriched category has advanced our understanding that host factors and biological pathways involved in viral replication represent one of critical determinants for human susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection.",

Especially we have 106 local healthy poultry workers who have been heavily exposed to A(H7N9) viruses and serve as better controls than general population in this study. Moreover, we are unable to replicate our findings in a replication cohort, which is required for a standard GWAS. A genetic association at the early stage of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza encountered the same dilemma, in which 91 cases and 98 controls were applied to a GWAS. In that study, the cutoff P value was set as 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 for the identification of susceptible variants42. Apparently, we have identified the association variants with more stringent criteria.

The carriage of haplotype GG significantly correlated to LGALS1 mRNA expression (P = 0.050) in LCLs generated from 74 Chinese Han from Beijing (CHB). In x-axis, -/-, -/+, and +/+ denote non-carriers (N = 49), heterozygotes (N = 21), and homozygotes (N = 4) of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG respectively. The box denotes the interquartile range. The line and diamond within the box represent the median and average respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the data. (4b)Boxplot of LGALS1 protein expression corresponding to rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG in 21 LCLs (N = 8 for -/-, 9 for -/+ and 4 for +/+) by flow cytometry analysis. Carriage of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG significantly correlated to the LGALS1 protein expression in these LCLs (P = 0.025). MFI, mean florescence intensity. (4c)The anchor SNP rs4820294, a variant in the proximal promoter of LGALS1, regulated LGALS1 mRNA expression. A total of 19 mRNA samples (N = 2 for genotype A/A, 8 for A/G and 9 for G/G) from peripheral blood monocytes expressed differential levels of LGALS1 transcript in a genotype-specific manner (P = 0.031) by RT-qPCR assay. Levels of LGALS1 transcript are normalized with those of GAPDH. (4d) Gene expression levels of LGALS1 in human lung correlated to genotype groups of rs4820294 (meta-analysis P = 3.63 \u00d7 10\u22125). The lung cis-eQTL dataset has been generated from lung specimens collected at three centers examining a total of 1111 individuals. Denotations of boxplot are the same as 4a, except that open dots represent the outliers.",
