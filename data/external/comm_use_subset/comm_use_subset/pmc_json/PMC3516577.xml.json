Worldwide concern relates to the importation of infected individuals and the potential use of filoviruses as biothreat pathogens [1]. All current MARV strains belong to the Lake Victoria marburgvirus species, while Ebola virus (EBOV) strains are attributed to five different species: Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) [1],[2]. The species vary in their pathogenicity for humans with ZEBOV being most pathogenic (up to 90% case fatality rate), followed by SEBOV and BEBOV with about 50% and >25% case fatality rates, respectively. CIEBOV and REBOV cause lethal infections in nonhuman primates, but have not yet been associated with fatal human cases [1], [2]. Although EBOV (mainly ZEBOV) and MARV have been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo, today there is neither a licensed vaccine nor treatment available.",

            "text": "EBOV entry into target cells is still not fully understood and remains a focus of ongoing research. While a number of attachment factors seem to facilitate EBOV entry [3], so far no specific cell surface receptor molecule has been identified. Recently, it was shown that the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is required for ZEBOV infection [4], [5]. NPC1 is a ubiquitously expressed endosomal membrane protein involved in the fusion and fission of endosomes and lysosomes [6], and its deficiency has been shown to impact on HIV-1 particle release [7]. Its presence in the endosome fits the current EBOV entry model based on macropinocytosis, a cellular pathway proposed to be the main uptake mechanism of EBOV particles into cells [8]\u2013[10]. Previously, Chandran et al. identified the cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and cathepsin L (CatL), which are also present in endosomes, as important factors for ZEBOV entry [11]. According to the current model, cleavage of the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) by CatB is necessary for exposure of the core receptor-binding domain and fusion machinery, otherwise buried in the GP structure, to initiate fusion of the viral and the endosomal membrane [12]\u2013[14]. Subsequently, the viral genome along with the replication complex is released into the cytoplasm where replication and virus progeny production occur.",

            "text": "CatB and CatL are members of a family of 11 human cysteine proteases. Both proteases are highly abundant, broadly expressed and exhibit nonspecific proteolytic activity within lysosomes [15], [16]. CatB has been associated with TNF-\u03b1 induced liver damage and seems to play a critical role for the development of pancreatitis [17],[18]. Despite these facts, catB\u2212/\u2212 mice are phenotypically similar to wild-type control mice and fully immunocompetent [18]. CatL is important for epidermal homeostasis and the regulation of the hair cycle and as such catL\u2212/\u2212 mice are hairless [19]. Furthermore, CatL is involved in MHC II-mediated antigen presentation in epithelial cells of the thymus [20]. Consequently, catL\u2212/\u2212 mice have reduced numbers of CD4+ T helper cells, which are however fully functional. A double knockout mouse lacking CatB and CatL has been generated but is not viable long enough for experimental use [21], [22]. To determine the importance of cathepsins in viral infections, various inhibitors of endosomal acidification, cathepsin or specifically CatB and CatL activity have been used in vitro. In these studies the role of cathepsins have been demonstrated to be important for the entry of reovirus, SARS-CoV, henipaviruses and ZEBOV [11], [14], [23]\u2013[27].",

SARS infected cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and plaques were counted three days after infection. Four days after infection EBOV inoculated cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and removed from BSL4 following standard operating procedures. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized and foci were stained with a rabbit anti-VP40 antibody (kindly provided by Y. Kawaoka, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) or a rabbit serum directed against REBOV-NP (kindly provided by A. Takada, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) followed by a FITC-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma, ST. Louis, MO). Foci were counted using a fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging LLC, Thornwood, NY).",

For further analysis of ZEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells we performed a different in vitro assay based on foci reduction using the same inhibitors. Cells were seeded and treated with various lysosome and cathepsin inhibitors for one hour, infected with ZEBOV wild-type (wt) for one hour, covered with carboxymethyl cellulose containing inhibitors and fixed after incubation for 4 days. The number of foci was determined by immunostaining. Only the inhibition of CatB resulted in significantly reduced virus entry, whereas CatL proteolytic activity did not appear to be obligatory for ZEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells, although CatL is highly expressed in these cells [27]. SARS-CoV was used as a CatL-dependent control virus [26] to verify the activity of the CatL inhibitor (Fig. 1). In addition to ZEBOVwt, we also tested a furin cleavage site knockout ZEBOV (ZEBOV-Fko) [28], [29] and the MA-ZEBOV in this assay to determine whether furin cleavage of the glycoprotein or mutations caused by the adaptation process of the virus to mice would influence the requirement for cathepsin cleavage. Both viruses entered Vero E6 cells in a CatB-dependent manner similar to ZEBOVwt and were not affected by the presence of the CatL inhibitor (Fig. 1). These results show that the uptake of all tested viruses occurred by utilizing the cellular endocytotis machinery as indicated by the inhibitory effect of Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an endosomal acidification inhibitor. Furthermore, proteolytic processing of the ZEBOV-GP by furin is not a prerequisite for cathepsin cleavage in the virus maturation or entry process. In addition, mutations throughout the viral genome acquired during the adaptation process of ZEBOV to the mouse have no influence on ZEBOV uptake.",

Therefore, we studied the role of cathepsin cleavage on virus entry for BEBOV, CIEBOV, REBOV and SEBOV using a representative strain for each EBOV species. Foci reduction assays were performed and evaluated as described above. Infection of all viruses was reduced in the presence of BafA1 (Fig. 2), confirming that endosomal acidification plays a critical role during the entry process of all these EBOVs. Interestingly, only the maximum concentration of the CatB inhibitor had an effect on BEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells, whereas CIEBOV, REBOV and SEBOV produced foci independent of the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 2). The entry of none of the EBOVs was affected by the CatL inhibitor. This data suggests that CatB is not equally important for the entry of other EBOVs and seems to have a selective effect on ZEBOV and a limited effect on BEBOV entry.",

Vero E6 cells were treated with inhibitors (BafA1 100 nM; CatB 100 \u00b5M; CatL 10 \u00b5M) for one hour prior to ZEBOVwt infection (MOI = 1). After unbound virus was washed away the cells were covered with medium containing inhibitor (BafA1 50 nM; CatB 50 \u00b5M; CatL 5 \u00b5M), samples were taken at the indicated time points and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for virus titration. Virus titers were determined on Vero E6 cells using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and calculated using the Reed and Muench formula (Fig. 3A) [31]. The results demonstrate that ZEBOV replicates to similar titers in the presence of CatB or CatL inhibitor (difference less than 1 log); the presence of both inhibitors reduced ZEBOV replication by about 1 log. This indicates that the CatB inhibitory effect on entry is likely compensated for by other cellular proteases. However, BafA1 reduces virus growth by more than 2 logs, showing that endosomal acidification is important for efficient ZEBOV entry and replication (Fig. 1, 3A). In order to further confirm the data we performed ZEBOVwt and MA-ZEBOV infections in MEF cell lines deficient in the expression of CatB, CatL or both cathepsins. The cells were infected for one hour with ZEBOVwt or MA-ZEBOV (MOI = 1) and samples were taken at the indicated time points. Virus titers were determined on Vero E6 cells using a TCID50 assay and calculated using the Reed and Muench formula (Fig. 3B,C) [31]. ZEBOVwt and MA-ZEBOV replicated similarly well in the absence of CatB or CatL or both proteases. Although small differences in titer were observed at certain time points, one-way ANOVA did not find statistically significant p values (Fig. 3).",

The catB\u2212/\u2212 and catL\u2212/\u2212 mice are well characterized [37] and therefore ideal to determine the importance of CatB and CatL for ZEBOV replication in vivo. MEF cell lines obtained from these mice have been used here and in previous studies to demonstrate that mouse cathepsins are functionally similar to human cathepsins and important for ZEBOV-GP-mediated entry [11], [38]. Groups of catB\u2212/\u2212, catL\u2212/\u2212 and control mice were infected with 1,000 LD50 of MA-ZEBOV and monitored daily for signs of disease including weight loss (Fig. 4A,B). On day 3 and 7 post-infection 3 mice in each group were euthanized and blood, liver and spleen samples were taken to determine the viral load (Fig. 5). All animals in the catL\u2212/\u2212 group succumbed to MA-ZEBOV infection between days 7 and 9, similar to most control mice. All but one of the 22 catB\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with MA-ZEBOV succumbed to infection; the one surviving mouse showed signs of disease and recovered (Fig. 4A,B). As previously observed, the infection of control mice is not always uniformly lethal [33]. Here 3 out of 22 control mice developed disease but survived the challenge (Fig. 4A,B). There were no significant differences between viral titers in liver, spleen and blood samples taken on day 3 post MA-ZEBOV infection from the three different mouse strains (Fig. 5A). At day 7 post Ma-ZEBOV infection liver and spleen titers were similar among all three mouse strains but higher in the blood of catB\u2212/\u2212 and catL\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wt mice (Fig. 5B). This indicates that disease progression and outcome were similar in all the animals (Fig. 4, 5). In order to exclude the occurrence of mutations in the glycoprotein (GP) gene of MA-ZEBOV during in vivo replication, we determined the full GP sequence and found no mutations (data not shown).",

In addition, we could demonstrate that post-translational furin cleavage of ZEBOV-GP into the fragments GP1 and GP2 is not a prerequisite for cathepsin processing. This result does not come as a big surprise considering earlier studies reporting that ZEBOV replication and pathogenicity were independent of furin cleavage [28], [29].",

            "text": "Interestingly, all other EBOV species tested in our study seem to enter Vero E6 cells in a CatB- and CatL-independent manner suggesting that other endosomal proteases might functionally replace CatB in virus entry. This finding is in disagreement with recently published data showing that cell entry of VSV- and HIV-1-based pseudotype particles expressing different EBOV-GPs is CatB-dependent [38], [39]. Interestingly, one of these studies also showed that cell entry of infectious SEBOV (strain Gulu) was CatB- and CatL-independent as we could demonstrate here for a different SEBOV strain (strain Boniface) [38]. The discrepancies among our data and some of the previously published reports might be explained by the differences in size and shape of particles as well as the mechanism of particle uptake. HIV-1 particles are largely spherical and the mechanism of uptake is receptor mediated through the interaction of its surface glycoprotein gp160 with CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 [40]. VSV particles are short and bullet-shaped and cell uptake occurs via the endocytic pathway [41]. In the infectious ZEBOV context the interactions of GP with VP24 and VP40 (missing in pseudotype particles) may further influence the cellular uptake mechanism [14], altogether suggesting that HIV-1- and VSV-based pseudotype particle entry could be different from those of filovirus particles, which are extremely long and filamentous in shape and mainly utilize macropinocytosis for particle uptake [8]\u2013[10]. In addition, the CIEBOV-GP used to produce VSV-based pseudotype particles in one study lacked the mucin-like domain, which could have had impact on the GP structure and thus might have affected cleavage and entry [38]. In our view this highlights the need for confirmation of data obtained from pseudotype particle systems by live EBOV infections or at least by the use of EBOV-like particles. Finally, cell type and origin may also influence CatB- and CatL-mediated cleavage as studies were performed in different cell lines.",

Moreover, signaling of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has initially been associated with CatB, CatL and CatK activities [46], [47]. However, studies using bone marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells derived from cathepsin knockout mice did not identify a single cathepsin as an essential factor for TLR9 signaling [48], [49] and rather point towards a role of other endolysosomal proteases, such as asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) [50] for activation. Thus, it seems reasonable to speculate that in the absence of CatB and CatL, such as in corresponding knockout mice, other endosomal proteases will mediate EBOV-GP cleavage enabling cathepsin-independent EBOV entry into target cells.",

For yet unknown reasons, CatB seems to play a more considerable role in ZEBOV uptake than it does for any other EBOV species. EBOV seems to have evolved to use a broader spectrum of endosomal proteases to ensure GP cleavage and thus facilitates successful infection of target cells. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting single proteases are unlikely to be beneficial to combat EBOV infections.",
