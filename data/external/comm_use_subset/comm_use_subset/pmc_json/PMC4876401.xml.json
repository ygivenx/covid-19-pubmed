All samples were passed through SPI-pore polycarbonate track etch filters (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) held inside a 13 mm Swinnex\u00ae filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). For bacterial sample preparation, 0.08 \u03bcm pore size filters were used, while the 0.05 \u03bcm pore size was used for MVA and Ebola virus preparations. Filters were first wetted using 2 mL Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) in a 3 mL Luer-Lok\u2122 syringe. To load the sample onto the filter, 100 \u03bcL of sample was added to 5 mL DPBS in a 5 mL syringe. After attaching the syringe to the filter holder, the sample was filtered through the filter using a Legato 200 syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) at a rate of 1000 \u03bcL/min. In some cases the concentration of the sample was too high which would overload the filter and fluid could not flow through. If such an event occurred the sample was diluted 1:5 or 1:10 until fluid could flow freely through the filter. The sample filters were washed using 3 mL syringes containing 2 mL each of 50%, 70%, 85%, 95% and 100% ethanol in increasing concentration. Following the last wash the filter was removed from the filter unit and allowed to air dry for 30 min. The filter was trimmed, cut in half and placed on a 9 mm carbon disc (SPI Supplies) and mounted on a 3/8\u201d aluminum stub (SPI Supplies). Flash Dry silver paint (SPI Supplies) was used on each of the four corners of the filter to create a contact between the filter and the stub. The samples were removed from the biosafety cabinet and sputtered with gold using a Quorum Q150R S (Quorum Technologies, East Sussex, UK) containing a 0.1 mm gold target. The sample was pumped down, purged with argon and sputtered with gold for 120 sec on a rotating stage.",

For the forts step either 2 cm of 0.2 mm diameter Al wire or 3 cm of 0.2 mm Au wire was wrapped around the tungsten filament. SPI-pore polycarbonate track etch filters were placed on a filter paper in a glass dish and secured from movement with metal washers. The dish was then placed in a Turbo Carbon Coater (Agar Scientific Ltd, Stansted, Essex, United Kingdom). Once under vacuum, the voltage was gradually increased until the Al or Au wire had completely evaporated. The 2 cm of aluminum wire would create a metal film approximately 18 nm thick, and the 3 cm of Au would create a metal film approximately 27 nm thick. To produce a filter with two types of metal on it the following variant of the above procedure was used (Supplementary Fig. S1b). The filter was placed on top of the filter paper on the glass dish, and a razor blade was placed directly over one half of the filter. One of the above metals (Au or Al) was evaporated as described above. Following this, the razor blade as removed and a second razor blade was used to cover the region of the filter where the previous metal was evaporated, and the remaining area of the filter was then coated with the second metal.",

A total of 100 \u03bcL of sample was added to 5 mL DPBS and filtered through the coated filter using the Legato filter pump.

The filter was immediately trimmed, placed on a carbon disc mounted on an aluminum stub. The four corners of the filter were painted to the aluminum stub using Flash Dry silver paint.
