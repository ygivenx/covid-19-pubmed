This study also used RT-PCR techniques; however, an important limitation was the lack of microscopy and sputum cultures for common bacteria associated with ILIs such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b and serology for atypical pathogens. Also, limited clinical data were recorded for these cases, making it difficult to assess the clinical significance of the various pathogens detected and the virulence of each pathogen. Although swabs from all patients meeting our eligibility criteria were analysed, we have no data concerning the number of patients who may have been admitted with ILI but not swabbed. The lack of clinical data also limits comparison between sites as differing admission criteria may impact on the distribution of pathogens. Similarly, both the lack of clinical data and the absence of data concerning overall admission limit our ability to interpret the findings relating to ICU admission; the finding that adult patients were overrepresented amongst those admitted to ICU could represent differential routine sampling of adults and children on such units; however, we feel this is unlikely. There was a lack of data related to patients and co-morbidities, such as immunosuppression and COPD, which could also have had an impact in the severity of infection seen. Furthermore, a lack of suitable control patients also limits our ability to determine the attributable fraction of ILI that is likely to be caused by each virus and also prevents useful analysis of the relevance of the high rates of nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b.",

            "text": "Establishing the aetiology of ILI is becoming increasingly important, not only to establish the burden of various pathogens in order to improve management and prevention, but also to guide antiviral treatment and to try to limit the inappropriate use of antimicrobials to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Our study, along with overwhelming evidence from many other studies from these and other countries, suggests that viral causes of ILI are much more common than bacterial causes, but that the viral aetiology may vary in space and time. In recent years, the emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and avian influenza viruses A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 has highlighted the risks posed by respiratory viral infections in humans and SEA has become an area of increasing interest for monitoring pathogens. Very little has been published from this region regarding the incidence and prevalence of viral or atypical organisms that can contribute to ILIs, making studies looking at this increasingly important.",
