            "text": "Avian coronvaviruses (ACoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense and single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb in length that encodes four major structural proteins; the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein and the spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 (N-terminus) and S2 subunits (C-terminus) [3]. The S1 protein is responsible for host selection, induction of protective immunity and most of the neutralizing serotype-specific antibodies are directed against S1 [4,5]. Most of these neutralizing epitopes are mapped in the hypervariable region (HVR) in the S1 subunit (amino acid positions from 38\u201367, 91\u2013141 and 274\u2013387) and mutation in these regions may contribute to the generation of escape mutants [5]. Since the S1 subunit shows higher sequence diversity (up to 50%) than S2 [6], molecular characterization and serotyping of coronaviruses are based mainly on the S1 gene sequences [7]. The S1 gene sequence can be used to differentiate all six IBV genotypes, and 32 different lineages that have been identified worldwide [8]. New genotypes of IBV are emerging frequently in different parts of the world and many factors are accounting for this emergence and evolution [9].",

It has now been well established that the wild birds are important reservoirs for avian influenza A virus [13], and may likely be for other respiratory and enteric viruses. In recent years, ACoVs have been isolated from various wild bird species that create a suspicion that wild birds play a role as CoV reservoirs and as ACoV carrier/transmitter influencing its epidemiology [14,15]. In Egypt, ACoV was first described at 1954 by Ahmed, [16], and subsequently several reports emphasized the prevalence of the disease in the country that results in great economic losses to the Egyptian commercial poultry industry [17,18,19]. Currently, the variant IBV are the most prevalent strains in commercial poultry sectors in Egypt, especially from the early months of 2011. Therefore, genotyping of ACoV field strains is crucial to detect the emergence of new variant strains as well as evaluating the existing vaccination programs [19]. To date, only limited studies have been performed to systematically monitor the prevalence of ACoVs in wild bird populations.",

Analysis of full length S1 protein was conducted to determine the presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites among the isolated Egyptian ACoV strains using BioEdit software version 7.0.4.1 [23]. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and high level clustering pattern based on full length S1 gene between ACoVs reported here and previously characterized from Middle East including Egypt and other parts of the world; we first compiled a dataset of all available S1 gene sequences. Then, this dataset was aligned in BioEdit version 7.0.1 [23] using Clustal W algorithm and was trimmed to equal lengths. To avoid sequence length biasness in evolutionary incursion, all sequences that aligned poorly or with incomplete information were excluded from the analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the nucleotide sequences of the S1 genes. For maximum-likelihood analysis of the phylogenetic relationship, a best-fit model was chosen on which further calculations and an ultrafast bootstrap equivalent analysis were based. IQ-tree software version 1.1.3 was used for these operations [24].",

However, there is no clear classification criterion for the circulating ACoVs, worldwide, which possesses complications in establishing epidemiological linking.

            "text": "Factors that contribute in the evolution and emergence of ACoV in commercial poultry are largely unknown. Evidences are that wild birds might constitute transmission vectors for ACoVs even in a huge geographic territory. It has also been proposed that when an ACoV infects the same wild bird host, this could lead to the emergence of new variants of ACoV [32] and the possibility of recombination between different ACoV strains. To assess the ACoV existence and carrying-potential of Egyptian wild birds for the first time in the country, 557 cloacal swabs were randomly collected from different wild bird species in different Egyptian governorates. Detection of gamma-coronaviruses (ACoVs) in wild bird samples from geographically separated populations highlights the potential of wild birds in the possible dissemination of ACoV. Since most of the ACoV positive wild birds were migratory and that Egypt has been proposed to be an important gateway in the Middle East and North of Africa for most of the emerging infectious diseases, it is likely that the mixing of birds and viruses from different hemispheres can lead to disease transmission. From this and other studies, it is reasonable to assume that a great variety of hitherto undetected ACoVs exist in wild bird species. Previous studies that examined the host range and genetic diversity of CoVs have revealed that ACoVs in wild birds are present mainly in wildfowl (Anseriformes) and waders (Charadriiformes) [22,33,34]. Our results corroborate these findings and indicate that ACoVs are common among different wild birds. Conclusively, the data show that there is circulation of genetically divergent ACoVs among wild bird populations in geographically distinct areas of Egypt. Although the number of samples analyzed in this study was limited, it can be assumed that the genetic variation of ACoVs among wild birds is much higher than previously thought. Isolates of ACoV that are sequenced and reported here not only show a high similarity with isolates from Israeli, Libya and Oman strains but are also highly similar (99\u2013100%) to the strains previously reported from commercial poultry flocks, which implies that certain strains may have the potential to spread directly or indirectly to distant regions or to other countries.",

In 2001, an Egyptian variant I strain (Egypt/Beni-Suef/01), closely related to the Israeli variant strain, was reported on different poultry farms [18]. Another variant was also identified in 2011 [27] and designated as Egyptian variant II. Variant genotype can be subdivided into at least eight subgenotypes according to their origin and evolution; 4/91 genotype, Taiwan and China like, Australia variant, QX variant, IS/1494/06 (Egy/Variant-1) and IS/885 (Egy/Variant-2).

These genotypes were formerly present in the Egyptian commercial farms five years ago with increasing the mortality rates in broiler flocks but had not been described before in wild birds because of low surveillance and epidemiological studies directed towards wild birds worldwide. Our results indicated the prevalence of Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06 genotype) (5/14; 35.7%), in spite of relative abundance of Egy/variant 2 (IS/885 genotype) (9/14; 64.3%). The emergence of Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06-like) and Egy/variant 2 (IS/885-like) in Egypt has been introduced to the poultry population raises several speculations; it could be due to the introduction of carriers during importations of chicks from Middle East countries where this genotype was endemic or due to the role of migratory birds as a source of infection [19] that has been proposed in this study. Likewise, clustering of some ACoVs isolated from wild and commercial birds in Libya, Oman, and Kurdistan and allocated within the same Egyptian clusters either Egy/variant 1 and or Egy/variant 2 highlights the role of wild birds for transmission of such viruses. These results indicate the circulation of ACoVs in Egyptian wild birds, which could potentially be through the wild birds of neighboring countries and support the possible role of wild birds in the transmission of such viruses.",

            "text": "Recombination has been well reported and is thought to be a contributing factor in the emergence and evolution of different coronavirus genotypes as well as different species of coronavirus [37]. Thor and colleagues reported that the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within ACoV indicate a progressive evolutionary change that is the result of recombination events in the ACoV genome that play a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus, leading to the emergence of new IB genotypes and serotypes [38]. Many recombination events have been reported in different ACoV strains, not only between field (wild-type) and vaccine viruses but also among field viruses either within the same genotype (intra-genotypic) or between different genotypes (inter-genotypic) [39,40], giving rise to new ACoV genotypes [41]. Recombination analysis for the aligned sequences under study report the detection of recombination events; 1) AY091552.2 IBV IS/720/99/S and JX173489.1 IBV/Eg/CLEVB-1/012 strains to produce a recombinant strain MF034384 ACoV/Teal/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-13/2016; 2) KC197206.1 IBV/ck/Egypt/12vir6109-79/2012 and JX174186.1 IBV Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 strains to produce a recombinant strain MF034381 ACoV/Cattle erget/ Kafr El Sheikh -Egypt/VRLCU-10/2016, which may be a precursor for further variants. Further studies are required to determine the pathobiological and clinical features of this virus in a chicken model. In addition, continuous sequence analysis for the currently circulating IBVs is highly recommended to study the possible spread of this virus and for better understanding of its phylogenetic relatedness to other viruses. These results indicate a progressive recombination of events that occur among wild birds as well as between the circulating variant field strains. Positively selected fragments of genes encoding viral proteins exposed on the surface of the capsid have been documented in other viruses [42,43]. There is an association between positively selected sites along the S1 subunit identified in this study and mapped neutralizing epitopes. It has been reported that mutations in the S1 protein often result in changes in antigenicity [5]. Likewise, parts of the hypervariable regions (HVR1, 2 and 3) defined in this study were shown to be under strong positive selection in the ACoV strains. Taken together, the strong positively selected motifs among the S1 protein may thus be associated with the immune response and receptor binding and would thus be important in future ACoV vaccine development.",

Intensified surveillance of wild birds is an important means of assessing the relative prevalence of ACoV variants, and this knowledge would aid risk assessments and risk management of these viruses. Wild bird surveillance that includes virus isolation may also be a tool for obtaining strains of ACoVs that can be used for vaccine development and diagnostics. Moreover, this study provides insights into the genetic diversity of ACoVs in wild birds\u2019 reservoirs. Further assessing the prevalence and effects of ACoV infections in wild birds will increase our knowledge on CoV interactions with their hosts and may suggest as yet unexploited avenues for combating CoV infections.
