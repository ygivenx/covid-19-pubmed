            "text": "All living organisms are made up of proteins. The biochemical information that resides in the protein primary sequence maintain their structure, function, and even its own stability. This biochemical information is instructed/governed by the amino acid sequences. The versatility of amino acid sequences provide the different outcomes [1]. In fact, the chemical properties of amino acids which are embedded in the primary protein sequences take the key role to determine the biological activity of the protein. In-silico techniques to analyze this information in terms of their chemical nature or structure are yet to be explored completely. In literature, the phylogenetic analyses are done from various angles and different perspectives such as multiple alignments for the selection of conserved block [2], Randomized Accelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAXML) [3], conditional Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity [4], tree alignment graph [5] etc. A phylogeny or evolutionary tree represents the evolutionary relationships among a group of protein sequences. The longer the branch in the horizontal dimensions of the tree, the larger is the amount of change. Trees are useful in bioinformatics, system biology and various phylogenetic comparative methods [3, 6\u201310]. Despite its great implication, phylogenetic tree can find only similarity analysis of amino acid sequences but not the chemical nature of amino acids in a protein. Also multiple sequence alignment of several hundred sequences always produces a log jam in respect of time and biasness [11]. Several groups have worked with reduced amino acid alphabets to tackle to the above stated problems by reducing the sample size which can perform at the same level as the full alphabets in correct pair wise alignment of sequences with regards to structure similarity but low sequence identity [12, 13]. Recently XIE et al. [14] proposed a new method by using hydropathy group of amino acids to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequence based on the conditional probability of the protein sequence [14]. Studies are also done on using the substitution matrices from several protein blocks of aligned sequence segments resulting the characterization of related proteins [15]. However, studying only the amino acid sequences of proteins limits our scope of understanding of the similarities and differences among proteins with regard to their biochemical nature. Further analyses of the sequences considering chemical nature are required and it can be done if the sequences can be studied through the chemical nature of individual amino acid.",

Their transitions in the sequences are calculated to demonstrate the unique chemical transition pattern of amino acid clustering in each sequence of conventional myosin II family. Various patterns with repetition and without repetition of amino acids\u2019 chemical group are enumerated. We also expand our study to another inter sub-family of Kinesin, KIF1A and find a unique common block in the neck linker region. This evolutionary conserved block is hypothesized to reveal the functional role in the conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy. Further, our studies are expanded to different protein families and results demonstrate various common blocks in the family members have been highlighted.",

            "text": "For the analysis of any newly determined sequences or their evolutionary ancestry, sequence similarity searching is one of the first and foremost informative steps. By the virtue of modern protein sequence databases and searching programs, like BLAST (units 3.4) [45], PSI-BLAST [45], SSEARCH (unit 3.10) [46, 47], HMMER3 [8, 48] and FASTA (unit 3.9) [49], one can produce a very accurate and comprehensive statistical estimates and can predict more than 80% protein sequence samples that share significant sequence similarity. While searching for the sequence similarity is an effective and reliable strategy for identifying sequences, which share a common evolutionary ancestor and the formation of phylogenetic tree, it also possess a significant limitation. When we find some excess sequence similarity, we imply that they are from common ancestry and homologous to each other, which is not entirely true. Homologous sequences do not always share significant entire sequence similarity, but has significant intermediate sequence and structural similarity. Search tools like BLAST, HMMER or FASTA cannot detect this false negatives (i.e.; homologous sequences with non-significant similarity scores), although they can detect and minimize the false positive [8]. Therefore, the emergence of the study on the alignment free analysis is obvious. Using alignment free methods, the biological sequence was supposed to be transformed into an object for which statistical or algebraic theory may be useful as analytical tools. For analyzing the DNA sequences based on the above mentioned basics, there had been significant number of works for the last three decades. These allow to analyze DNA sequences qualitatively and offer a way of viewing, comparing and sorting various genomic sequences. Although, both DNA and protein sequences belong to a symbolic sequence, there are very few methods for analyzing protein sequences qualitatively. This is mainly because of the extension of protein sequences having increased number of possible alternatives for 20 amino acids. These amino acids are the keys to understand the proteins existing in the cell. So, analysis of these amino acid sequences is an important part for the post-genomic study. Recently, several schemes have been proposed to plot amino acid sequences. They categorized the 20 amino acids into different types, including as a word with three to five different letters. Their processes not only describe amino acid sequence, but also determine the similarity/dissimilarity of different protein sequences [14, 47, 50\u201357]. However, their methods only consider the physical information of the sequences that are conserved in a particular amino acid sequences. Neither their physicochemical properties nor the properties of the adjacent amino acids are considered in those works. Few groups have used the reduced amino acids alphabets to reduce the sample size. They are able to design native-like protein structure from those reduced amino acids alphabets and they hypothesize that their approach might be useful for structurally related proteins weak sequence identity. But one distinguished limitation on their methods is the limited sample of sequences which can only determine a fraction of total sequences. Further, few group works with the converted amino acid sequences of proteins into three letter sequence based on the hydropathy profile of amino acid and algor a conditional probability as a new invariant for the protein sequences [14]. Their method can also show the distribution of amino acids at different positions in the sequences. But, they cannot predict the pattern of conserved chemical nature in the sequences. Therefore, grouping the amino acids based on their chemical properties may offer a better insight into the comparative study of proteins.",

            "text": "All the designed algorithms follow our categorization of various groups based on chemical properties of individual amino acid. Our method gives the clear explanation of the breaking point of every branch of the phylogenetic tree using the number of distinct chemical group transitions. We are also able to place two new myosins (MYH15 and 7B) in the updated phylogenetic tree (Fig 2) by using percent identity matrix. Based on our designed algorithm we can easily find out the conserved domain/common motif with and without repetition of amino acids. By using the results of Algorithm 2, we have provided several conserved patterns that are common to the NMII family. We find another two significant blocks, one block of length 20 aa maximum of 40% similarity in between non-muscle myosin and muscle myosin group located in ATP binding region and another one block of length 17 aa maximum of 94% similarity located nearer to the ATP binding region (S7 Table, by using Algorithm 3 and 4). This may also suggest that the ATP binding region is more chemically conserved compared to Actin binding region. This commonality of chemical patterns may be useful for predicting the structures of proteins, designing the drugs, inhibitors etc. We have shown a longest block of length 20 aa (34842742818772342342, Table 14) among myosin II members in human. The two sub-blocks from the above block \u201c348427\u201d/FGNAKT and \u201c8772342\u201d/NSSRFGK are fixed amino acids sequence among all the members. There is no-chemical group variation of the sequences of those two sub-blocks. These two sub-blocks are previously described in [58] which is located in the ending of HH (helix H). They have worked with 8 representative sequences (among three from myosin class-II, and two from myosin class-I) from different classes of myosin. As per our hypothesis considering the invariant chemical group, we find that 7th and 8th positions of 20 aa length block are replaced by V/L and K/R respectively where V or L and K or R respectively from same chemical group. Combining these two positions along with others 5 fixed positions and two sub-blocks, we find the block of length of 20 aa which is chemically conserved across the myosin II 14 members in human and that is new compared to the earlier works. The conserved block of length 10 aa (4414348427, Table 16) from MyoI members, last 6 residues are the first sub-block \u201c348427\u201d as described above and also matched with the previous findings [58]. The first position of the 10 aa length block is varying either V or L, and keeping next three positions fixed, combining the 10 aa length chemically conserved block which is also new observation using our algorithm. Two small sub blocks as \u201c414\u201d/LDI and \u201c431\u201d/GFE are located in between HO and HP reported in [58]. This finding is also matched combining with the biggest conserved block of length 9 aa (\u201c444143431\u201d, Table 16) from MyoI members. Similar is the case for the block of length 9 aa (344127244, Table 16) among MyoI members found by our algorithm, a sub-block is previously reported as \u201c4127244\u201d/LLEKSR in [58] located in between HH and HI among various classes of myosin. Further, we have shown another block of length 9 aa (424224434) which is highly chemically conserved among Myo1 family members but not the conserved as well among various classes of myosin except the position 7th which is \u20184\u2019/G as observed in previous report located in between HA\u2032 and HB\u2032 [58]. Therefore our findings of various conserved blocks are bigger in length (aa) and could be responsible for group/family specific functions.",

The neck linker regions of KIF1A class of kinesins are known to be conserved among the family members, but not among the entire super family of kinesins [44]. This would explain the absence of this motif in other kinesins. In kinesin, the neck linker sequence has been shown to be responsible for the generation of mechanical force, in a manner analogous to the converter domains of myosins [59, 60]. This suggests that the KIF1A class of kinesins and conventional myosins may be more closely related than other kinesins and myosins as they share a common motif even though they are from different motor protein families. We hypothesize that this motif must play a functional role in the conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy. This is probably the reason of the said evolutionarily conserved status (Fig 3).",

            "text": "This result proves the validity of our method in highlighting similarities among proteins with dissimilar amino acid sequences and from different families. The motif shows only 50\u201362.5% similarity if one goes by amino acid sequence alone, yet the differences in amino acids are minor (leucine and isoleucine, or alanine and glycine) in terms of their chemical natures. Thus the overall chemical nature of the motif is more similar than what alignment of amino acids would imply. It has been already documented that ATP turnover of myosin I follow the same pathway like other myosins [30]. Our current results of having 80\u201390% similarity in the ATP binding site of myosin I and myosin II also supports that previous finding. Our algorithms also can find the repetition of same pattern in different positions of particular sequence which is quite harder to see by the sequence alignment method. One can easily modify our algorithm based on requirements like changing the number of groups, weight assigning of the groups etc. and this is also applicable even if one needs twenty standard amino acids as twenty groups. Also application can be directed for the pattern analysis among the protein families of various evolutionary species where protein functioning is same. Further, our block finding algorithm (Algorithm 4) can also be used for identifying the highly similar/dissimilar block in the unknown sequences especially for cancer gene or protein family based on neighborhood pattern analysis which is our further investigation. Our confidence relies on this method for assessing the commonalities among various motor proteins and will be quite useful particularly for investigating the function of amino acids during its structural conformation in pathological conditions.",
