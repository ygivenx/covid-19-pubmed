SARS is caused by a new pathogen that was finally identified as a coronavirus (SARS-Cov) [1, 2]. SARS-Cov is regarded as a person-to-person infectious disease that infects suspected individuals through droplet transmission [3]. After infection, patients go through a 2-to-10-day incubation period before typical symptoms (fever, cough, and body aches) appear. During the incubation period, the patients are contagious to surrounding people [4]. To date, there is no vaccine for SARS, no reliable diagnostic test, and no specific treatment. This leads to the need for refinement of public health controls to be effective [5, 6].",

Traditionally, epidemiologists focus on the temporal epidemic evolution and describe it through various types of mechanical models [4, 10, 11]. Riley et al. admitted the spatial impact, but their model lacked detailed spatial analysis. However, because of the wide spread of SARS, typical temporal models have been unable to effectively explain its dynamics. As a result, the pandemic cannot be explained as a combination of endemics. Complex spatial transmission networks [12], compound period epidemics, and overwhelming government controls inspired epidemiologists to research this type of person-to-person infectious disease more profoundly with respect to its geographic features. Dye and Gay [13] suggested that doing so could lead to variations in average contact rate. Lloyd-Smith et al. simulated SARS dynamics in a complex network based on an epidemiological mechanism with full consideration of population, contact rate, control strategies, and spatial diffusion [14, 15]. However, their approach requires the assumption of numerous parameters, which in turn require the support of detailed data. The approach makes it difficult to explain overall spatial transmission without geographic epidemic analysis. Wang et al. [7] unveiled the broad existence of spatial clusters during the Beijing epidemic periods, influencing government intervention [16]. This work inspired us to investigate spatial principles in SARS transmission, which could include significant indications for pandemics within a more general perspective.",

Recent advances in geostatistical analysis, which have been effectively used in infectious disease mapping, health risk assessment, and epidemiological studies, could be applied in SARS research for spatiotemporal analysis [17, 18]. The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) approach of modern geostatistics incorporates higher-order statistical estimation for space-time epidemic phenomena and has shown more accurate mapping results than those derived from linear kriging geostatistics [19]. We benefited from such advantages in investigating statistical features of the SARS epidemic and in simulating geographic transmission aspects on a day-by-day basis. We focused on exploring and understanding spatial heterogeneity impacts of SARS transmission and simulating and mapping the disease temporally. Under the increasing threat of pandemics in 21st century, the present study illustrates actual epidemic spread and provides useful information toward establishing government intervention to preventing pandemics.",

Even though some cases were recorded at locations using various scales, the records were eventually sorted at county level to facilitate processing. Considering that population movement is one of the effects on SARS diffusion, the following order was observed in the geocoding process: (1) registered permanent residence; (2) temporary residence (work address); (3) onset location; and (4) reporting unit location. To maintain rigorous containment, sanitary departments collected minute information for spatial indexing. Thus, the registered permanent residence was selected as the first index for the benefit of data integrity and for monitoring the impact of mass population movement. On February 1, 2003, during the period of SARS outbreaks, the Spring Festival took place. People commonly travel to join family for this traditional Chinese festival, returning to their permanent residence after 1\u20134 weeks. This population movement increased the probability of cross infection among family members and travellers. Consequently, with some exceptions, the temporary residence, onset, and reporting unit locations could be additional spatial information in geocoding the infections. Some cases lacked records of both permanent residence and workplace, and the only available addresses for these were syndrome onset locations. If all the above addresses were void, the hospital address was used as the only thread to locate the patient, although this was rare in our research. We focused on outbreak regions for convenience and clarity in the process. There are 194 counties in the focus area, which is described in greater detail in subsequent sections. Among them, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Taiyuan experienced the most severe SARS outbreaks. We used a 2002 county-level digital map to illustrate the epidemic (Figure 3).",

Once distances are defined within the S/TRF, permissible functions can be used to describe correlations in space-time. The covariance function that yields spatial and temporal autocorrelation between two points, p and p\u2032, is given by (3)cxp,p\u2032=Xp\u2212Xp\u00afXp\u2032\u2212Xp\u2032\u00af\u00af.In this function, X(p) and X(p\u2032) represent a pair of realizations (possibilities) at p and p\u2032 in the SARS outbreak S/TRF. It is expected that the observation data sample statistics should be the same as the S/TRF. For example, the data mean model should coincide with the average statistic, and the empirical covariance model should follow the covariance statistic of the field. Let c\nx be the arithmetic covariance. c\nx is presumed to be a theoretical function that is the same as the traditional covariance models in kriging analysis, such as the spherical, exponential, and nugget models. Following this initial setup, the classic Bayesian model is then incorporated, as shown by(4)fXk \u2223 Xdata=A\u22121\u222bDdXfGXmap,where(5)A=\u222bDdXfGXdatais a normalization constant and D is the domain field of X\nk.

For instance, we sought the most probable value for X\nk and so computed the differential coefficient for X\nk that gives the prediction PDF mode, that is,(7)\u2202fXk \u2223 Xdata\u2202Xk=A\u22121B\u222bDdX\u2202\u2211a=1n\u03bcagXa\u2202Xk,where B = e\n\u03bc0 is a constant, g(X\na), a = 0,\u2026, n are functions representing the stochastic G-KB information, and \u03bc\na, a = 0,\u2026, n are the so-called Lagrange coefficients that are in spatiotemporal coordinates. The latter serve as weights for the corresponding g(X\na) functions in (7). BME theory develops a system of equations for each value of g(X\na), from which the \u03bc\na coefficients are calculated. Subsequently, their values are inserted in (4) and (6) to evaluate the posterior PDF, whose maximum gives the prediction mode estimate.",

First, given the limited period of spread, the SARS infection presumably could not reach a location 15 degrees away within mainland China, even considering rapid population transportation by air.

For example, among the total 5318 cases, 1934 were recorded in Beijing. This number is much higher than the number of outbreak cases observed in nearby cities and entire counties. Second, cities typically have convenient transportation to nearby cities and counties. Thus, commuting and population exchange between cities and nearby locations is likely to be much greater than corresponding activity between those cities and more distant areas. Consequently, suspected individuals from the nearby countryside are more likely to have travelled to a city and contacted infected people, and vice versa. This would increase the probability that the disease spreads in urban areas and their environs.

Approximately 19% of people working in health services were infected by their patients. These professionals were able to obtain rapid treatment, which means that it was unlikely that they would contribute to SARS spread outside their areas of residence. Housewives and retired people are groups that were extremely susceptible to infection by their families. However, these population groups typically have no desire to move to distant places. The most probable suspects for disease spread were labourers and businessmen, but these groups constituted only ~7% of total infection cases.",

The starting point of this theory is that the SARS virus always evolves and mutates. Most virus strings evolve slowly with similar infectivity, but a small fraction evolve into extremely infective virus types. People affected by such virus strings are so-called super spreaders. These individuals were comparatively very contagious, and they transmitted the virus to dozens of other people. For instance, five super spreaders in Singapore were found to have infected 103 people [28, 29]. The randomness of virus mutation to high infectivity indicates considerable randomness in the way people became infected. This randomness also extended to the relatively random directions in which the epidemic spread among cities.",

In the present study, spatial and temporal aspects of this person-to-person contagious disease were explored, and its spatial and temporal transmission dynamics were simulated through the BME method. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics. Moreover, there was a high temporal correlation and relatively low spatial correlation of SARS outbreaks. In addition, the BME modelling demonstrated that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we analyzed potential causes, including infected populations and transportation modes. Our findings can benefit epidemiological control of pandemic infectious diseases and public health protection in the future.",
