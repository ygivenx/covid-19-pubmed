The fluidity of SLBs was confirmed by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) performed prior to the fusion assay. Membrane fluidity of SLBs can affect the hemifusion kinetics and is thus a crucial parameter to control when comparing the rate of fusion between assays1721.

To track the fusion reaction and its intermediate steps, viral membranes were labeled with quenched amount of octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18). Upon membrane hemifusion, the membrane dye that originated in the viral envelope spreads into the SLB and dequenches as the fluorophores diffuse radially away from the hemifusion site, an event that is easily detected by a CCD camera (Fig. 3, bottom).

The hemifusion rate constants of matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31) and native influenza X-31 are similar at all initiation pHs. The hemifusion kinetics of native influenza viruses is strongly dependent on pH as well as matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31). The rate of hemifusion increases almost linearly from pH 5.3 to 4.7 and reaches a plateau at the \u201cfastest\u201d fusion pH. It is not evident from the data shown in Fig. 5 that mismatching pseudotyped particles (H3X-31/N2MS96) exhibits the same dependence on pH. While the maximum rate of fusion of mismatching pseudovirions (H3X-31/N2MS96) also occurs at pH 4.7, the error associated with the parameter falls within the rate constant values associated with adjacent pHs, thus it can be concluded that the hemifusion kinetics of mismatching pseudotyped particle (H3X-31/N2MS96) is triggered by acidification but rate independent of triggering pH. pH independent influenza fusion rate is not unprecedented, as we also observed a similar flat trend for a clinical isolate, A/Brisbane/2007/H3N217.",

            "text": "The number of HA trimers (N) required for pseudotyped particle fusion was also calculated and compared with that of native influenza X-31 (Fig. 5). At high, physiological pH values, N values for influenza virus X-31 and matching pseudovirions (H3X-31/N2X-31) are found to be approximately 3, while the N values of human:human mismatching pseudovirions (H3X-31/N2Japan) vary between 1.5 to 3. A few possible interpretations of this variation include a change in the number of HA contributing to bending the membrane over this range, but this is hard to rationalize with our understanding of the fusion process. It may reflect that other processes are dominating the kinetics in this regime, but it also seems at odds with what we know about hemifusion, that there would be such oscillations among rate limiting steps within this range. What seems most likely to us is considering that N is an exponential fit parameter; it gives rise to an inherent sensitivity in data fluctuations and thus produces a wider range of output values. Considering that the authentic X-31 does not have such variation in its fits for N, we may attribute these fluctuations as resulting from variations among the particles themselves: the HA incorporation in VSV pseudotypes are lower than the authentic influenza X-31, or that the morphology of the rhabdoviral pseudovirions are bullet-shaped compared to the spherical morphology of authentic X-31. For human:avian mismatching pseudotyped particles (H3X-31/N2MS96) and HA-only pseudopaticles (H3X-31), N is consistently closer to unity as a function of pH. These findings suggest that only one HA trimer may be needed for mismatching pseudotyped particle fusion. However, since hemifusion is a multi-step process, an N value equal to 1 more likely indicates that another process less dependent on viral particle properties, e.g. the merging of membranes, may occur so slowly that kinetics are dominated by this single step, thus resulting in a gamma distribution where N = 122.",

In order to understand better the differences in fusion kinetics observed among matching (H3X-31/N2X-31) and mismatching pseudovirions, quantitative Western blots were performed to determine the relative protein incorporation of HA in particles. The internal VSV matrix protein (M protein, ~37 kDa) was used to normalize band intensities of HA. The three hemagglutinin bands include one uncleaved HA (HA0) at 75 kDa and the cleaved HA (HA1 and HA2) at 50 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6). HA1 bands were normalized to corresponding VSV M bands to calculate the cleaved proportion of HA protein in different samples. The normalized bands were normalized again to the HA1 bands of HA only pseudoparticles (H3X-31) so the values could be compared between different HA-NA combinations. HA band intensities of human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2MS96) and human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2Japan) are ~45% and ~20% lower than X-31 matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31), respectively.

Taken together, these results indicate that the matching NA is required for efficient HA trafficking to the plasma membrane, which is the site of virion budding for both native influenza and VSV pseudotyped particles. Danieli et al. and Lee et al. suggest that an influenza A virus requires at least three HA trimers to be close to each other to form a hemifusion site2226, which indicates that the density of HA trimers affects the hemifusion rate of influenza A virus. The immunofluorescence analysis shown here confirms the Western blot HA densitometry data and suggests that NA plays an important role in expression and intracellular trafficking of HA, and that even within the same subtype (N2), different NAs can influence cell-surface expression of HA.",

The data demonstrates the hemifusion kinetics of NADNA-treated influenza virus and non-treated virus are similar at pH 4.0 and pH 5.1, and there were no significant differences on viral binding either. The hemifusion rate constant of NA inhibitor treated virus is 0.24 s\u22121 with a value of 2.5 for N at pH 4, and 0.06 and 1.9 at pH 5.1. That NADNA does not affect hemifusion kinetics of the virus follows the conclusions of Ohuchi et al.\u2019s work29, where they also found that NA inhibitors do not impact either binding or fusion; however, they suggest that NA function does impact endocytosis, and in this way, impacts \u201centry\u201d.

We produced four different types of influenza pseudoparticles: pseudoparticles containing HA only (H3X-31), X-31 HA and NA matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31), and to model N2 NA gene reassortment, human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2Japan) and human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2MS96). Particles that incorporated both X-31 HA and NA displayed distinctly faster fusion kinetics than those harboring HA only.

However, the degree of NA incorporation by Western blot showed that the densities were similar for the three different NAs in the pseudoparticles. These results are also supported by the immunofluorescence microscopy assay that shows that HA trafficking varies considerably depending on which NA is co-expressed in transfected BHK-21 cells, leading to differential HA expression on cell plasma membranes, whereas NA expression does not seem as affected. These analyses demonstrate that NA does not act directly on HA function but rather has an indirect effect by modulating the trafficking and incorporation of HA into pseudotyped viral particles. Our work shows that switching NAs of the same subtype (N2) can have profound effect on fusion kinetics mediated by the HA protein. This study suggests that HA-NA combinations form pairs of varying compatibility that can ultimately impact HA fusogenicity. In summary, we show that influenza X-31 H3 HA requires its matching neuraminidase to maximize the HA packaging density on VSV pseudoparticles, and the matching pseudoparticles exhibit similar hemifusion kinetics as influenza X-31 by single virion fusion assay.",

The SPT fusion platform has been useful for screening HA neutralizing antibodies32.

Microfluidic devices were formed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a molding process. The silicon mold was coated with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich) via vapor deposition to facilitate the release of cured PDMS. A 10:1 (elastomer:crosslinker) mixture of Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) was mixed and degassed to remove bubbles before pouring on the silicon mold. The PDMS then was crosslinked in the oven for 3 h at 80 \u00b0C. Both the piranha cleaned glass cover slip and the microfluidic device were assembled by oxygen plasma bonding.

Index-matching immersion oil (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was added to the glass coverslip of the microfluidic device and the objective.

The Laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to control the angles of incidence in the optical pathway. Exceeding the critical angle (~62\u00b0) generates total internal reflection due to the difference in refractive indices of the two different substances (glass and aqueous buffer), and further creates an evanescent wave that penetrates about 100 nm into the aqueous buffer.
