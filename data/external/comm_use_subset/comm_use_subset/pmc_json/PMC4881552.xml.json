Previous studies found that GCs could inhibit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, promote adipogenic differentiation and induce osteoblast apoptosis [4,5,6], thus breaking the balance between bone resorption and formation. The majority of GC effects depend greatly on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR is involved in multiple signaling pathways and is critical for both cell survival and cell death [7,8]. Evidence has shown that GR is widely expressed in many cell types, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts [7,9]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GC-induced apoptosis remain undefined, hindering the treatment and prevention of GC-induced adverse effects on the skeleton.",

However, PEDF involvement in GC-induced osteoblast apoptosis and whether GCs affect PEDF expression in osteoblasts have not been reported. PEDF is a secreted glycoprotein of roughly 50 kDa, with 418 amino acids. Although first identified in cultured pigment epithelial cells from fetal human retinas, PEDF is widely expressed throughout the human body, with multiple biological functions [11,12]. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that PEDF displays cytoprotective activity in several cell types such as granule cells, photoreceptor cells and cardiomyocytes [13,14,15]. In bone, PEDF induces the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblast precursor cells, which contributes to bone formation [16]. Broadhead et al. [17] reported that PEDF expression plays a key role in endochondral ossification, which is essential for bone growth and healing.",

An 80 kDa PEDF receptor is a member of PNPLA2 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 2), and also known as adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) which transports protein-2.2, Ca2+ independent phospholipase A2 and desnutrin [20]. Upon PEDF binding, PEDF receptor (PEDF-R) induces phospholipase A2, liberating lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fatty acids that are involved in a variety of cellular activities [18,21,22]. The Akt pathway is able to integrate stimuli from a variety of signals initiated by hormone/growth factor signaling, and mechanical loading. Phospholipids and LPA have recently emerged as bioactive compounds that exert mitogenic effects and display cytoprotective activities through the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation in many cell types, including osteoblasts [23]. As GCs and PEDF have major effects on the skeletal system, it is of great importance to understand the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) on PEDF expression, as well as the PEDF involvement in DEX-induced osteoblast apoptosis.",

According to CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assay (Figure 1A,B), cell death rates were increased with doses and prolonged DEX treatments, in agreement with data obtained for primary osteoblasts and other osteoblastic cell lines [5]. DEX treatment caused approximately 40%\u201350% cell death at 10\u22125 mol/L for 24 h (Figure 1A,B); this concentration was used in subsequent experiments. Correspondingly, Western blot showed a stark elevation in caspase-3, which was markedly activated within 12 h in osteoblasts treated with DEX (Figure 1D). The levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which also reflects apoptosis, were increased in a similar fashion after DEX treatment as shown (Figure 1C,D). No obvious difference was observed in caspase-3 activity at 36 h or more. These results indicated that DEX promoted MC3T3-E1 cell death by activating apoptosis-related signaling.",

After incubating in the presence of 10\u22125 mol/L DEX for 24 h, an approximate 70% reduction in relative PEDF protein was observed (Figure 2A,B). Since PEDF is a secreted glycoprotein, PEDF protein levels were also assessed in the culture medium. DEX showed a highly suppressing effect on PEDF protein synthesis (Figure 2C,D). Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis showed that PEDF in supernatants was markedly attenuated with prolonged DEX treatments (Figure 2D).

The translational isoforms of GR could selectively regulate pro-apoptotic enzymes (Granzyme A and caspase-6) in pre-osteoblasts [24], suggesting that GR mediates GC-induced osteoblast apoptosis generally by regulating several specific genes and proteins.

Our data confirmed the notion that rPEDF could protect against DEX-induced apoptosis in cultured MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Moreover, gene silencing was used to characterize the role of PEDF-R in the PEDF-protective process. Additionally, we have described a similar cytoprotective role of PEDF/PEDF-R in cardiomyocytes [26,27]. Here we found that rPEDF had no effect on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast survival in normal conditions because pro/anti-apoptotic substance levels (e.g., LPA) under normal conditions are relatively stable. However, treatment with DEX down-regulated PEDF expression and modified this balance, subsequently leading to altered PEDF-related signal transduction.

One of the most important lipolysis products is bioactive LPA, which could bind to its receptors (Gi protein-coupled LPA receptors) and operate as a second messenger that affects cell signaling. LPA is capable of activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and increasing Akt phosphorylation [23,28], which in turn inhibits pro-apoptotic molecules. We observed a change in LPA levels after rPEDF treatment under DEX conditions. The DEX-induced decrease in PEDF expression and lipolysis leads to reduced LPA amounts, which directly affect Akt phosphorylation; exogenous rPEDF increased the production of LPA via PEDF-R, and promoted cell survival. A recent study found that PEDF deficiency in mice results in increased total body fat [21,29], illustrating its systemic role as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Since PEDF is implicated in lipid metabolism, it may enhance lipolysis to reduce DEX-induced adipogenesis, which in itself is a protective factor. Hence, there is enough data suggesting that PEDF can protect against DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis and alters cell survival partly through LPA-mediated Akt activation. Meanwhile, osteoblasts undergo apoptosis due in part to PEDF level reduction.",

MSCs are sensitive to apoptosis with the long-term or high-dose application of DEX [30]. Simultaneously, PEDF is involved in bone remodeling as it affects osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation. Recent studies revealed that PEDF up-regulates osteoblastic genes that promote osteoblastic differentiation [31]. Besides, evidence has shown that PEDF is involved in MSC and osteoblast progenitor differentiation; meanwhile, suppression of PEDF leads to decreased alkaline phosphatase levels and mineral deposition [16]. Here, we assessed the relationship between DEX and PEDF, and found that PEDF expression was negatively correlated with DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. These results revealed that PEDF displays pro-osteogenesis properties in both osteoblast sources and outcomes. Interestingly, PEDF is reported to impede osteoclastic differentiation by inducing the expression of osteoclast-repressive genes [31]. Akiyama et al. [32] found that osteoclast differentiation, RANKL-mediated (receptor activator for nuclear factor-\u03ba B ligand-mediated) survival and bone resorption are inhibited by PEDF. In addition, PEDF-derived peptide 34mer could trigger Wnt signaling, which plays an important role in bone formation and homoeostasis [33]. The existing research, however, suggests that PEDF contributes to osteogenesis and osteoblast survival, providing a potential and effective therapeutic strategy for DEX-induced osteoporosis or other bone-related diseases. Our results that dexamethasone suppresses PEDF expression will provide new insights into dexamethasone function and clinical application.",

This constitutes an important advance in elucidating the molecular mechanisms for PEDFR-mediated cell protection. PEDF may be an important and indispensable factor in stabilizing the bone microenvironment and protecting against GC toxicity. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that GCs down-regulate PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms and what happens to PEDF in osteoclasts under DEX treatment need further investigation. This is a primary study that provides a new understanding of the complex PEDF effects on pro-osteogenesis; further in vivo assays are planned to confirm these findings.",
