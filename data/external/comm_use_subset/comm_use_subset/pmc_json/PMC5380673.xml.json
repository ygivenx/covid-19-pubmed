Even though PRRS is endemic in North America, recurrent emergence of new PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains results in an epidemiological dynamic that resembles an epidemic condition for the disease (2, 3). PRRSV epidemics impact the swine industry and commonly require prompt mobilization of resources for diagnostics (i.e., sequencing of the virus), thorough investigations to understand the origin of the emerging PRRSVs, and implementation of effective control measures.",

The SHMP is a voluntary project that aims to monitor the incidence of PRRS; it currently enrolls approximately 42% of the US sow population distributed in 19 states in the country. Interpretation of collected data to participants and the swine industry currently focuses on incidence. Additionally, the number of new cases and spatial\u2013temporal clustering have been previously investigated and reported to describe PRRS trends and to identify PRRS epidemics (4\u20136). However, the rate of new cases over time, referred to as incidence, serves as a proxy for risk but does not contribute as a metric for the epidemic progression or prediction of its evolution.",

The basic reproductive number (R0) refers to the average number of secondary infections caused by a primary case and is commonly used to characterize the transmissibility potential of a disease in a completely susceptible population (7). In contrast, the effective reproductive number (Re) can be used to characterize transmissibility once a certain proportion of the population has been infected and is resistant (immune) (8), which would be an example for the case of PRRS in the US. The time-dependent reproduction number (TD-R) is a measure of disease transmissibility that can be estimated over the course of disease progression (9). The TD-R has been particularly useful for monitoring epidemic trends, identifying \u201csuper-spreader events,\u201d measuring progress of interventions over time and for providing parameters for mathematical models (e.g., models to test interventions) (10).",

This result would indicate that epidemiological dynamics are somewhat synchronized across regions, either because of seasonal weather changes or high connectivity among regions due to animal movements, as opposed to each region experiencing distinct temporal dynamics. Thus, our primary objective was to estimate the TD-R values for PRRSV using regional and system-level PRRS data from across the US, and to contrast it to incidence estimates and commonly investigated space\u2013time clusters. We hypothesized that the peaks on the TD-R, incidence, and the space\u2013time clusters would overlap. Furthermore, the secondary objective was to test whether the estimated TD-R were homogenous across four US regions. For this objective, the hypothesis was that the TD-R would be homogenous across all regions. Ultimately, results presented here will contribute to support the design and implementation of strategies for PRRS surveillance and control in the US.",

Status 1 designates actively infected herds (in which pigs were shedding the virus), status 2 indicates stable herds (no shedding detected in weaned pigs after following certain sample size requirements); 2fvi and 2vx refer to herds that were using live-virus exposure or modified live-virus vaccination as control strategies, respectively; status 3 defines herds that were provisionally negative (negative gilts introduced into the herd and remained negative); and status 4 denotes herds that were seronegative.",

For months in which no cases were reported, the count of new cases was set to 1 with the assumption that at least one outbreak was missed, which is a reasonable assumption for PRRS, because sow herds have different levels of immunity due to variable management strategies, and these can impact detection of disease. Secondly, the generation time distribution that best fit the observed occurrence of cases was estimated. This refers to the time between detection of a primary case and detection of a secondary case (8), and in our case, we considered the time lag between consecutive reported outbreaks and estimated its mean and SD from the observed epidemic curve using a function in R (9). Thirdly, the number of secondary cases for each case was estimated by averaging over all transmission chains compatible with the epidemic curves during the course of epidemics.

Interestingly, even though both the SE and UME regions are known to have high swine density, the patterns of PRRS transmission between them were different (Figure 2). However, PRRS management strategies within these two regions are known to differ, which may partially explain the findings: first, the immunity status of swine sites is anecdotally observed to be different among areas. For example, among high swine dense areas (SE and UME), it is believed that a certain amount of herd immunity exists in the SE region compared to the UME because producers in the latter area are more willing to attempt PRRS elimination from herds. In contrast, producers from the SE region are commonly using vaccination or live-virus inoculation strategies to mitigate PRRS impact (SHMP data not shown). However, it was observed that, even when certain amount of underlying immunity existed for the SE region, spreading events still occurred. This is also anecdotally observed from field veterinarians and producers. Another difference between the areas might be the use of farm filtration as a preventive measure for PRRS outbreaks, with the SE area being characterized by lower frequency of filtered farms compared to the UME area. Data gather on these and other management and biosecurity factors for future projects might help elucidating regional differences described herein.",

These events possibly reflected the introduction of new or previously undetected PRRSV strains in the SE, S, and UMW areas (10, 17). Overall, the TD-R appeared to be particularly useful for areas where the occurrence of outbreaks is sporadic, perhaps resembling an epidemic nature. In such cases, the TD-R appeared to flag outbreaks of new strains earlier when compared to the crude increase in the number of cases (Figure 2), which could be valuable for near real-time disease surveillance in the context of commonly emerging PRRSV strains. The use of TD-R could aid in the rapid detection of these episodes, which, combined with communication and mobilization with key industry stakeholders, could result in faster control of disease in a region. For areas where PRRS can be characterized mostly as having endemic nature, the use of the TD-R might still be useful for signaling epidemic progression, characterizing transmissibility over time, and identifying the occurrence of \u201csuper-spreader\u201d events.",

System A was characterized by multiple outbreaks over time, even though statistically significant PRRS spread periods were not detected. Predictable yearly increase patterns were visually suggestive for this area, except for the most recent years. Finally, system B appeared to have had a large outbreak in the end of November of 2013, which once more is anecdotally thought to be due to the incursion of an emerging strain in the region. The authors hypothesize that the reason why no further considerable outbreaks were observed after these is a combination between control measures being taken after the epidemic event, and the existence of a certain level of immunity in the herd after infection. For future studies, collection of such information is important to allow for testing of these and other hypotheses. We also recognize that, at time of writing of this manuscript, peer-reviewed publications on this matter are largely lacking; therefore, it is challenging to compare our study results with previous work done in PRRS or any other swine infectious disease.",

Even though growing pig sites are responsible for adding \u201cinfection pressure\u201d at a regional level, one could argue that this population is somewhat distinct from the sow farm population in terms of disease management. Infection of sow herds results in more dramatic consequences due to the fact that pigs produced in such facilities are commonly transported to other sites, and therefore decisions in regards to disease prevention and control are markedly different between these distinct animal populations. On a similar note, our analysis included data from voluntary participants only. Therefore, results do not necessarily apply to the overall population of swine sites in the US. The impact of this issue is hard to predict and assess, given that the representativeness of participating producers is not well documented; thus, the authors recommend results to be taken with caution.",

            "text": "Second, underreporting could have affected results, especially for systems and regions that have underlying immunity for PRRS. To the knowledge of the authors, there are no published methods for TD-R calculations that can account for such issue, but the authors believe the underreporting to be constant in time, thus not dramatically affecting results. Another methodology-related issue is the fact that in our case the epidemic was not observed from the first case onward; with results in overestimation of the initial reproductive numbers (9). For this reason, the authors decided not to consider initial estimated TD-R numbers (first 4 months) when summarizing these data. Finally, although the prevalence of intervals with 0 values was not high, padding the time series, by replacing the 0 values with 1\u2019s (a common practice in the time series analysis) resulted in a well-fitted distribution for the generation time, which subsequently increased the computation efficiency of the TD-R values. That said, this practice might have resulted in over or under estimation of the TD-R values in small regions with underreported outbreaks. However, as described above, the disease is endemic, and the assumption of at least one outbreak occurred in the small production region is biologically plausible in the context of epidemiology of PRRSV in the US. The authors also recognize that the CIs estimated using the time-dependent method could have been wide because few cases were observed at times. However, the authors are unaware of a method available (at time of publication) that would allow for better estimation of a transmission parameter in endemic settings.",

The TD-R is a promising complementary measure for incidence, because the latter is limited to measuring the amount of cases per unit of time but does not provide insights on the epidemic progression or effectiveness of control measures, which can be accomplished with the calculation of the former. The use of the TD-R may be complemented by other tools, such as, for example, the use of sequential Bayesian R0 for prediction of increases in the incidence as well as signaling the end of epidemics (18).",
