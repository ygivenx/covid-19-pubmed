While a global problem, individual strains predominately remain unique to distinct geographical regions, with limited antigenic similarities between strains (1) and resulting in limited vaccine cross protection. Typically, morbidity is 100% for pathogenic strains of the causative agent, although mortality tends to be low. Despite this, some strains may cause nephritis or facilitate secondary bacterial infections, increasing mortality up to 50% (2). In addition, some serotypes demonstrate tropism for the oviduct, directly causing decreased egg quality and production (3). Poultry is an important food source worldwide, with an estimated 55 billion chickens produced worldwide per annum, including 5 billion for egg production. It has been estimated that every 10% reduction in IBV would be worth around \u00a3654 million to the global poultry industry (4).",

            "text": "The etiological agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gammacoronavirus belonging to the Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family, species Avian coronavirus. The positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral genome is typically 27 to 28 kb and encodes the spike, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and structural proteins and accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 4b, 5a, and 5b in the 3\u02b9 end of the genome. A large replicase gene is located at the 5\u02b9 end of the genome, which expresses two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. The two polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases, resulting in 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps); nsp2 to nsp11 are encoded by pp1a, and nsp2 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16 are encoded by pp1ab, the latter produced as the result of a \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Untranslated regions (UTR) are located at the 5\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 ends of the genome. Unusually for an RNA virus, nsp14 exhibits 3\u02b9-to-5\u02b9 exoribonuclease activity (5) which, in conjunction with nsp12, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), forms part of a proofreading system that facilitates a high-fidelity replication of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs. The extent to which the proofreading capability of IBV impacts genetic variability, and the role of genetic diversity within an IB viral population, remains undefined despite having a discernible in vivo effect (6).",

Risks of using live attenuated vaccines include breakdown of the vaccine or reversion to virulence (7, 8), and current European regulation requires such vaccines to include the demonstration of stability of attenuation over 6 in vivo passages. The process of generating live attenuated IBV vaccines typically involves serial passaging of wild-type isolates in embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs for up to 100 passages, resulting in a loss of pathogenicity in the final virus (9). Despite being a well-established method, the exact mechanisms underlying IBV attenuation have yet to be determined. The replicase (10, 11), structural (12), and accessory (13) genes have all been implicated in IBV pathogenicity.",

Here, given the potential for an RNA virus to mutate, it is conceivable that de novo attenuating mutations occur and are selected for during egg passage. Alternatively, it is possible that given the highly diverse genetic structure of RNA virus population, the so-called \u201cviral swarm,\u201d low-frequency attenuated viruses could preexist within a virulent population, with the process of egg passaging driving selection of such attenuated genotypes. Additionally, recombination reported in the field will likely have a role in the evolution of IBV (15, 16). Regardless, understanding the diversity of an IBV intrahost population is critical to deciphering of the mechanisms of IBV attenuation.",

Conversely, the characterization of the genomic changes that confer attenuation has been extensively reported but is limited to Sanger sequencing (21, 22). In the present study, we serially egg passaged a lab-pathogenic strain of Massachusetts serotype, M41-CK, in four independent parallel replicates with the aim of generating four attenuated viruses. The resulting viruses have been characterized using in vivo and in vitro methods, confirming viral attenuation. We have deep sequenced these attenuated viruses to assess genomic differences both from the virulent parent and across multiple replicates of egg-passaged M41 and identified shared and unique sequence variation across these five viruses.",

With the intention of furthering this field, we serially passaged M41-CK in four separate replicates to the point of attenuation and performed deep sequencing of the final-passage viruses to observe the resulting genomic differences and sequence variation. Our efforts identified few SNPs shared among all four of the attenuated final-passage viruses at both the consensus and subconsensus level. While one mutation (U24293C) was shared between all four attenuated viruses, C at the position is common between both pathogenic and nonpathogenic publicly available IBV sequences and is therefore unlikely to be involved in attenuation. This would imply that each attenuated isolate is attenuated by a different means (i.e., there is no single attenuating mutation shared across all four attenuated viruses).",

Due to the nature of serial passaging, it is possible that some observed variation occurred after the point at which these viruses would be deemed attenuated and suitable for vaccine use. Current strategies for characterizing the pathogenicity of IBV isolates largely rely on in vivo studies, as limited overlap is observed between in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Without a suitable alternative for assessing attenuation accurately, in vivo characterization remains the only representative means of assessing loss of pathogenicity. Given the number of samples involved here, it would not be ethical to perform pathogenicity experiments with each individual egg-passaged virus to establish the point at which our serial passages are deemed attenuated, as the harm would outweigh the benefit.",

Surprisingly few variants within our virulent population were detected, with fewer still shared between the virulent and attenuated populations. This would first indicate that de novo mutation, as opposed to the selection of preexisting attenuating mutations (within the virulent population), is the cause of attenuation in this instance. Due to the coverage profile of our data set, the detection of diversity across the entirety of the genome, particularly in replicase and spike proteins of lineages A and A1, is limited. A consequence is that all mutations occurring in multiple lineages may not have been fully identified and detection of diversity in A and A1 is not wholly representative as a result. To fully answer this question of selection versus mutation, sequencing of intermediate passaging at a higher depth of coverage provided by current high-throughput sequencers would be required to show the change in frequency of variants at a higher temporal resolution. Such cross-sectional analysis would provide insight as to how the viral population evolves over the course of passaging.",

From the same starting material, our data suggest that it is possible to differently attenuate four viruses with minimal overlap between these viruses. In addition, few of the SNPs identified in the attenuated viruses match the nucleotide found at these positions in commercial vaccine strains of the same serotype. This highlights that attenuation of IBV by serial egg passage results in different patterns of genomic variation each time. It is possible that the mutations identified here are linked by a means that have yet to be established. Regardless, the potential for industry to generate different vaccines against the same virulent strain with poor consistency is concerning. Moreover, the ability for potentially virulent subconsensus mutations to remain within an attenuated population demonstrates the risk of reverting to virulence and potentially has an evolutionary consequence when introduced into the field and in competition with other IBV strains. Regulations in place for market authorization in Europe do limit this risk. However, there is still an importance to move away from the process of attenuation by egg passage. Our findings would suggest a need for the genetic structure of live attenuated vaccine viruses generated by egg passaging to be fully characterized by deep sequencing, not only for purposes of quality control but also to improve our understanding of the mechanism of attenuation. This information, coupled with a reverse genetics system, would allow for the development of rationally attenuated IBVs with high efficacy and safety.",
