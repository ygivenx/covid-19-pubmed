            "text": "Photolyases are evolutionary old proteins found in many species from bacteria to vertebrates [1,5]. Recent studies suggested that DNA repair might have a common evolutionary origin with circadian rhythmicity [6]. Circadian rhythmicity is a roughly 24-hour cycle of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes. It was found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [7]. Circadian rhythms enhance fitness of organisms in both constant and changing environments [8]. A circadian clock system consists of a central oscillator, input and output pathways [9]. The central oscillator is able to maintain the rhythmic output in the absence of the external stimuli [10]. Unicellular organisms rely on a single independent circadian oscillator, whereas organisms with differentiated tissues may have multi-oscillator systems to coordinate with different rhythms [7]. In animals, the central oscillator resides in the brain, which controls the circadian behavior of the whole organism and synchronizes peripheral clocks in other organs [11].",

Cryptochromes and photolyases form the photolyase/cryptochrome superfamily [17]. Cryptochromes are ubiquitous in plants and animals [11]. Photolyases and cryptochromes have two conserved domains, a DNA photolyase related domain and a FAD binding domain. In addition, plant and animal cryptochromes possess a C-terminal domain of a variable length, which is absent in the CRY-DASH and photolyase proteins [18] (Fig 1, the conserved domains were identified by the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) tool [19]). The variation in the length of the C-terminal domains results in functional diversity within the cryptochrome family [20]. The C-terminus of the mammalian cryptochrome possesses a nuclear localization domain required for CRY\u2019s nuclear localization; deletion of the C-terminus prevents mammalian CRY from negatively regulating the transcription of other circadian components. The C-terminal domain of the Arabidopsis CRY is essential for mediating the signaling mechanism by responding to the light [21].",

The 3D-architectures of the photolyase/cryptochrome superfamily members are similar. All of them fold into 2 domains, an \u03b1/\u03b2 domain and a helical domain. These 2 domains are connected by a variable loop and the 2 lobes of the helical domain form a groove, which is called FAD-access cavity. FAD embeds in this \u201cmolecular pocket\u201d, and may be resolved at the bottom [23].",

First, the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML v.3.0 [33]. The approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) [34] was applied to estimate a statistical support for individual nodes. Second, we used the Bayesian relaxed clock as implemented in BEAST v.2.1.3 [35].

However, PHR2 in Arabidopsis thaliana shows no chloroplast DNA repair activity [57]. At the same time, the CPD class II PHR of higher plants exhibits the CPD repair function in DNA of all cellular genomes (nuclear, chloroplasts and mitochondrial) [58]. The property of photolyases to target different organelles is thought to be associated with some functional motif, but the exact mechanism of organelle-targeting is yet to be determined [58]. Among eukaryotes, plants have the largest set of various types of photolyases (Table 1). Some of them have similar functions, as in the above example. Such functional redundancy may be an evolutionary adaptation to the relatively high, as compared to the other eukaryotes, exposure to sunlight and, respectively, harmful UV radiation.

A Drosophila-like type 1 CRY is a UV-A/blue light receptor in the circadian oscillator, while a vertebrate-like type 2 CRY is thought to be a negative regulator of the clock\u2019s transcriptional feedback loop [61]. Whether the type 2 cryptochromes also have photoreceptor function is still debated [11]. There are several transcription factors involved in animal circadian feedback loop, including Period (PER), Timeless (TIM), brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1), CYC (Cycle) and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK or CLK) [62\u201366]. The molecular mechanisms of the fly and mammalian circadian clocks are different. The fly CRY binds to TIM that results in degradation of the latter and subsequent inhibition of the activity of a PER/TIM dimer. Without CRY, the PER/TIM dimer is able to enter nucleus and repress the transcription of other clock genes. In mammals, three period (PER 1, 2 and 3) and two cryptochrome (CRY 1 and 2) proteins form a cytoplasmic heterodimer, which enters the nucleus and then inhibits transcription of CLK and BMAL1 [67]. In plants, circadian clocks are entrained by red light receptor phytochromes (PHY) as well as blue light receptor cryptochromes, but the signal transduction pathways were not comprehensively studied [68].",

Four of them (NP_001070765, NP_571865, NP_571866 and NP_571867; annotated as Cry1a, 1b, 2a and 2b, respectively) are very similar and appear in the same clade with vertebrate Cry1; one (BAA96850) annotated as Cry3 falls in the clade with vertebrate Cry2, one (NP_571862) is Cry4, one (NP_991249) is Cry-DASH and one (XP_009291670) is plant-like Cry [70]. Recently, a plant-like Cry was identified in D. rerio (XP_009291670), which may act as a circadian photoreceptor [70]. The maximum number of cryptochrome gene copies in other animal taxa (including birds, reptiles and amphibians) is usually 2 or 3. The extra Cry homologs in zebra fish were likely generated by ancient polyploidy events [71]. In the evolution history of vertebrates, their genomes were duplicated twice (occurred in the early evolution of deuterostomes), and a third genome duplication, which is named the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD), occurred in the basal group of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) (~ 350 Mya) [72]. The Cry4 genes are apparently evolutionarily oldest among animal cryptochromes. A primitive Cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae possesses homologs of Cry4 (XP_002609503 and XP_002595074), thus suggesting that Cry4 might emerge in Chordata, and then be lost in mammals. However, CRY4 was reported to exhibit neither (6\u20134) PHR nor circadian functions [73,74].",

Animal cryptochromes originated from (6\u20134) photolyases, while plant cryptochromes are evolved from CPD photolyases (Fig 2). Given that cryptochromes (except for CRY-DASH) are absent in fungi and prokaryotes, this may suggest that the plant and animal cryptochromes might appear soon after the origin of these taxa [77].

In the absence of photolyases, placental mammals rely on more complex and less efficient nucleotide excision system consisting of DNA glycosylases, nucleases and DNA polymerases to eliminate pyrimidine dimers [5,78]. It was hypothesized that the loss of photolyases in higher eukaryotes was associated with the reduced UV stress [5].

The generic feedback loop of circadian rhythm in fungi is different: blue light is absorbed by the flavoprotein white collar-1 (WC-1) [81]. Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms to exhibit circadian rhythmicity [82]; an environmental signal is transduced to the endogenous clock by the circadian input kinase A (CikA) [83], and the whole circadian system is controlled by the kaiABC gene cluster [84]. There had been no evidence for common ancestor of eukaryotic and prokaryotic circadian genes [85], until it was found that the cryptochromes have a common ancestor with the prokaryotic photolyase [17]. However, it is still unclear what circadian function is performed by CRY-DASH in prokaryotes. Another open question is how the distinctive circadian mechanisms emerged in different groups of eukaryotes. This prompts for further extensive studies of circadian genes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes to solve the above problems.",

In most cases, episodic diversifying selection operated on speciation events, e.g., plant CRYs of Angiospermae. Angiosperms are an evolutionary young (~179\u2013158 Mya) and species-rich group, which experienced fast diversification and dominated almost all environments on Earth [89]. The speciation processes were likely followed by episodic diversifying selection in circadian genes, which might help these species to adapt to various ecological niches. Similar scenario was reported for molecular evolution of other eukaryotic circadian genes, particularly plant phytochromes (PHY) [90]. This might imply coevolution of cryptochromes and phytochromes. Indeed, phytochromes directly or indirectly interact with CRY and perform similar circadian functions (red/far-red light receptors), thus PHY and CRY might evolve under similar selection pressure [91]. On the other hand, strong positive selection played a role in functional divergence of PHR/CRY proteins, e.g., Node 320 (divergence of CRY-DASH and plant PHR2) (S1 Fig).",

The observed high conservation of PHR/CRY sequences corresponds to the fact that PHR and CRY proteins maintain a conserved 3D structure [11]. On the other hand, only two conserved residues shared by all subfamilies (Fig 3). One of them, Arg, is located at position 12 of the alignment, which was reported within the binding site of Cl- in Arabidopsis CRY-DASH (R51 of PDB: 2VTB) [92]. As to S241, no functional or structural importance of this residue was reported previously. S241 is adjacent to \u03b1 helices; we hypothesize that this residue is essential for maintaining the secondary structure of \u03b1 helix and, respectively, for FAD binding (e.g., S260 and \u03b114 of Arabidopsis CRY1, PDB: 1U3D [93]).

According to the time estimates based on the ML and Bayesian approaches, plant, insect and vertebrate cryptochromes originated in Neoproterozoic Era (~1000\u2013541 Mya). Studies of fossil record and geological patterns suggest that, during that period, the day length steadily increased from 18 h at 900 Mya [94] to 21 h at 600 Mya [95] and to approximately 22 hours at 650\u2013600 Mya [96]. An ancestor of the vertebrate Cry1 and Cry2 duplicated in Silurian-Devonian Period (~443.4\u2013358.9 Mya) (Table 3 and Fig 4). At that time, the climate of Earth became stable and warm, the concentration of oxygen increased and the level of the harmful UV radiation lowered [97]. New groups of living organisms evolved and spread in this era, such as lobe-finned fish and amphibians [98]. As one of the main adaptation mechanisms, the endogenous circadian system increases Darwinian fitness through synchronizing the metabolic and other biological rhythms of an organism with environmental light/dark cycle [99]. Therefore, the circadian system in eukaryotes might have experienced certain evolutionary changes to adjust to the increase of day length. These changes might include, among the others, functionally important substitutions in the existing circadian genes, the origin of clock genes de novo or co-option of non-circadian genes to perform circadian function. In these terms, the general direction of the circadian system evolution in eukaryotes is similar to that in prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) [100]. Furthermore, the time estimates for the major events in evolution of cryptochromes and the cyanobacterial circadian system [101] correspond to each other and to the major environmental changes in the global light regime. For example, the origin of animal cryptochromes (elements of the circadian input pathway) occurred about the same time (~700\u2013600 Mya) when the bona fide circadian system of some cyanobacteria lost kaiA, also an important element of the circadian input [101], In turn, this period corresponds to the suggested upper time limit of the last of the three periods proposed to describe the role of UV radiation in the evolution of cyanobacteria [102].",

Escape from sunlight represented a major selective force for development of circadian rhythms [104]. Geological studies indicated that in Precambrian times (~3800\u2013544 Mya) atmosphere contained little oxygen and primitive organisms were exposed to high ultraviolet radiation during the daytime [105]. There are 2 main strategies for organisms to avoid the harmful effects of UV radiation [6]. The first one is repairing the UV-induced DNA damage which is the physiological function of photolyase. The other one is to avoid being irradiated, such as migrate to deeper water. These movements were observed by the diel vertical migrations of zooplankton, which initiated and controlled by light [106]. Such migrations also occur in other marine and freshwater organisms such as water flea Daphnia magna [107], and sensitivity was related closely to the UV photoreceptors in its compound eye [107]. These diel vertical migrations may help to understand the coevolution of photoreception and circadian rhythms, and the coevolution of their respective controlling genes [6].",
