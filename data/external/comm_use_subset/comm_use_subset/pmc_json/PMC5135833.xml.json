Chinese overseas health assistance has its roots in the ideological concerns during the Cold War when China dispatched its first medical team to Algeria in 1963 [6]. Since that time, China has indicated that its aid was grounded in the \u201cEight Principles for Economic Aid and Technical Assistance to Other Countries\u201d originally articulated by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1964, which were described as anchored in \u201cequality, mutual benefit with no strings attached\u201d [1, 7]. China\u2019s current assistance and investment policies in Africa are largely guided by the 2006 document entitled, \u201cChina\u2019s African Policy\u201d, which indicates that China \u201cwill continue to send medical teams and provide medicines and medical materials to African countries, and help them establish and improve medical facilities and train medical personnel.\u201d It also states that \u201cChina will increase its exchanges and cooperation with African countries in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and malaria and other diseases, research and application of traditional medicine and experience concerning mechanism for public health emergencies\u201d [8].",

            "text": "Despite these many initiatives, a key limitation of China\u2019s health aid approach is the absence of a cohesive approach and a coherent strategy of China\u2019s health diplomacy. It should be noted that China\u2019s health aid is primarily managed by the Ministry of Commerce, with the participation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the National Health and Family Planning Commission, with oversight from the State Council [10]. While the Chinese national government takes the lead to initiate and negotiate bilateral agreements with African countries, the implementation of these agreements rests with China\u2019s provincial or subnational governments. In addition, China\u2019s existing foreign aid policies are based largely on ad hoc central ministerial documents and regulations, which are not subject to approval by the legislative branch [11]. Furthermore, competition within the Chinese government ministries and at provincial levels further undermines the overall cohesion and coordination of China\u2019s aid [12]. For example, individual provincial Chinese governments are designated to provide specific African countries with medical teams, thus, this results in the allocation of different levels of resources to health projects based on provincial interest and their local capacity [13]. This has resulted in variations in the quantity and quality of the assistance provided to recipient African countries [14].",

For example, Li found that it was difficult to find a consistent report of even the total number of CMTs dispatched to Africa [16]. Some have argued that the lack of transparency reflects China\u2019s effort to avoid pressure both from African governments for more aid and from domestic criticism against supporting other countries while poverty remains a challenge at home [17]. Others pointed out that recipient African countries are also unwilling or incapable of informing other states on the amount of aid received from China [18].",

It is estimated that by 2009, more than 21,000 Chinese medical workers have provided services to 260 million patients around the world [1]. In addition, as of 2013, about 1000 Chinese medical team members have received medals of appreciation from recipient governments [28]. Their efforts have been acknowledged as filling critical gaps, particularly through their service in rural areas, positions that have been difficult to fill with African physicians [29]. In addition, some have countered the criticism to China by indicating that the western approach to aid, that is often couched in altruism, has failed to take the African reality into consideration and reflecting an arrogant premise of \u201cknowing what is best for Africa\u201d [30].",

A review [31] of China\u2019s health diplomacy in Africa showed that in 1950s and 1960s, China\u2019s relationship with African countries was framed as a counterbalance to the powers of United States and the Soviet Union. In the ensuing decades, China paid less attention to Africa as it sought to find its place in the international marketplace. In recent years, Africa has regained high prominence in China\u2019s overall foreign policy, and the Chinese government has reinvigorated its commitment to health assistance for African countries as a means to strengthen its diplomatic relations.",

For example, China began sending medical teams to Senegal in 1975, but withdrew such teams from 1996 to 2007, a period when diplomatic relations were severed. In addition, Thompson and Youde posited that providing healthcare resources not only helps China gain favorable trading terms and access to necessary resources, but also supports the government\u2019s attempts to portray itself as a good international citizen [31, 32]. However, despite the fact that China has become more active in global health, Huang warns that China\u2019s pursuit of health as primarily foreign policy could undermine its incentives and efficacy for greater international health engagement [6].",

In addition to the perception of China as acting in an opportunistic manner, concerns have also been raised as to whether China has the willingness and capacity to sustain and expand its health commitment to Africa. For example, China\u2019s health assistance to foreign countries may be hindered by domestic pressure to provide healthcare for its own people [11, 31]. Also, with the increasingly profit-based character of China\u2019s health system, many Chinese physicians may not be willing to serve overseas as part of medical teams, especially physicians from economically developed Chinese provinces [34, 35].",

In recent years, a trend can be observed in which China has adjusted its health aid focus towards a more diversified approach that aims to contribute to the development of local health systems [36]. This shift may have been motivated by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002, which prompted China\u2019s recognition of the importance of public health not only as a domestic issue but also as global public good [37]. China, along with other BRIC countries, has seen strong growth in its total health expenditure while at the same time its contribution to the global health care market is believed to have surpassed those of most G7 economies [38]. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa revealed the fragility of health systems in the affected countries and to some extent reinforced for China the need to engage in strengthening health systems. Consequently, China was one of the first countries to provide aid and medical workers to the region at the height of the Ebola crisis [39]. Similarly, China is also participating in an international task force to design the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (African CDC), with an additional 2 million USD contribution to its 2016 budget [40]. China has also affirmed its commitment to universal health coverage (UHC) and is working with African governments to build their own capacity to achieve UHC, focusing on technology transfers, pharmaceutical capacity around essential medicines and training of African health personnel [39, 41]. These new efforts suggest an encouraging new direction for China with the demonstration of a more explicit commitment to public health and sustainable development rather than its traditional focus on curative medicine and \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d infrastructure.",
