We measured the ensemble thermal unfolding of the oligonucleotide constructs for the pseudoknots (containing the residues 1\u201334) and a control hairpin (containing the residues 1\u201319) in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 with varying NaCl concentrations (0 mM, 200 mM or 1 M NaCl). In the thermal (un)folding experiments, all the melting curves are superimposable for heating and cooling curves (Fig. 2a,b), suggesting the thermal unfolding and folding transitions are reversible. In the buffer with 0 mM NaCl, except for SF348, two apparent transitions (with melting temperatures at Tm,1 and Tm,2, Tm,1 < Tm,2,) are observed for all pseudoknots (Fig. 2a,c). In 0 mM NaCl, the Tm,2 of SF206 (~80 \u00b0C, Fig. 2a) is similar to the melting temperature of the control hairpin (stem 1 hairpin) (Fig. 2b), suggesting that stem 2 (Tm,1) melts before stem 1 (Tm,2) in the SRV pseudoknots. SF348 shows two-step thermal melting in the buffers containing 200 mM (Fig. 2e) and 1 M NaCl (Data not shown), suggesting that stem 2 in SF348 is formed in 200 mM and 1 M NaCl but not in 0 mM NaCl. SF348 has a significantly lower Tm,1 compared to other pseudoknots, probably because the shortened loop 2 creates steric strain resulting in partial deformation of stem 2 and/or unstacking with stem 1.",

Consistently, in 0 mM NaCl, the Tm,2 values of SF209 (76.4 \u00b0C) and SF211 (71.2 \u00b0C) are significantly lower than those of other pseudoknots (Fig. 2c,d). As expected, except for SF209 and SF211, the Tm,2 of the pseudoknots in 0 mM NaCl are in a narrow range between 78 and 82 \u00b0C, which is close to the melting temperature of control stem 1 hairpin (80.1 \u00b0C). The SRV pseudoknots and the control stem 1 hairpin do not completely melt even at 95 \u00b0C (Fig. 2a,b,e) in the buffer with 200 mM or 1 M NaCl. Taken together, our thermal melting profiles suggest that the transition with higher melting temperatures (Tm,2) corresponds to the thermal unfolding of stem 1 in the pseudoknots. The two-step melting pathway observed in our study is in agreement with the coarse-grained simulation for SF206, although an apparent one-step melting transition was observed in the simulation41.",

However, our thermal melting data show no obvious correlation between Tm,2 and in vitro frameshifting efficiency measured previously19 by using a commercially available in vitro translation system (reticulocyte lysate (Promega)) (Fig. 2d). The absence of a correlation is consistent with previous observations37 and is likely due to the fact that the formation of stem 2 and minor-groove triples (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) in a pseudoknot may exert a coupling effect in stabilizing stem 1 as has been observed in recent nanopore pseudoknot unzipping experiments45. The thermodynamic stabilization effect due to the coaxial stacking between stem 1 and stem 2 and stem 1-loop 2 bases triple formation is not observed in the thermal denaturation, because under the global temperature perturbation, the base triples and stem 2 melt before stem 1.",

Thus, the triplex stability may correlate with the frameshifting efficiency. However, the thermal melting transitions for the triplex and stem 2 seem not to be resolved, resulting in one overlapped transition (Fig. 2a,c,e). Thus, the low-temperature transition (Tm,1, Fig. 2a,c,e) of the pseudoknots corresponds to the melting of both the tertiary triplex structure and stem 2. We did not observe a clear correlation between Tm,1 (in 200 mM or 1 M NaCl) and previously measured in vitro frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 2f)19. The absence of a correlation might be due to the fact that the melting of the triplex (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) and duplex (stem 2) are not coupled, i.e., triplex and stem 2 melt independently, but with an overlapped broad melting transition. The relatively broad melting transitions and limited resolution of the experimental data prevented us in extracting the thermodynamic parameters for the transitions91546. Taken together, our experimental ensemble thermal melting results reveal no correlation between thermal stability and in vitro frameshifting efficiency.",

We monitored the thermal unfolding process based on the average numbers of the hydrogen bonds formed in stem 1, stem 2 and stem 1-loop 2 triplex, respectively, in each replica of the REMD simulation (Supplementary Fig. S2). We observed that both stem 2 and stem 1-loop 2 triplex start to thermally melt at 351 K, with half of the hydrogen bonds disrupted between 449 and 461 K. Stem 1 starts to melt at around 390 K, with half of hydrogen bonds melted between 461 and 481 K. Furthermore, the detailed thermal unfolding pathway and intermediate structures can be revealed by the two-dimensional free energy surface plots (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together, the REMD simulation data suggest that stem 2 and stem 1-loop 2 triplex thermally unfold before stem 1, which is consistent with the unfolding pathway suggested by the experimental thermal melting data.",

A relatively high simulated melting temperature was also observed in the MD simulation of another RNA pseudoknot47. Thus, the discrepancy in temperature values might be due to the limitation of the force field and/or relatively short simulation time. Nevertheless, our simulation results confirm the relative stem stability observed in the thermal melting experiments and provide insights into the atomistic mechanism of the thermal unfolding of the SRV-1 pseudoknot.

We used a loading (incubation) buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, as our thermal melting experiments reveal that all the SRV-1 pseudoknot constructs can fold into the native structures in 200 mM NaCl (Fig. 2e). The migration rate of the stem 1 hairpin is significantly faster than the pseudoknots, which is consistent with the fact that stem 1 hairpin is smaller than the pseudoknots. The migration rates of SF206, SF209 and SF211 are similar, presumably due to the fact that the loop 2 sequences of these three pseudoknots are the same with the stem 1-loop 2 minor-groove triplex structure forming.",

The data suggest the critical role of A26 in stabilizing the stem 1-loop 2 triplex and compacting the pseudoknot structure. A single hydrogen bond is formed between U27 and G15 in the U27\u2219G15-C5 base triple (Fig. 1a,c)18, and the U27C mutation in SF220 is not expected to disrupt the hydrogen bond. However, SF220 has a slightly slower migration compared to SF206, which may be due to an unfavorable stacking between A26 and C27 (both with an exocyclic amine group) resulting in a loosened loop 2. SF348 has a similar migration as SF220, probably because SF348 has a smaller size with a 3-nt loop 2, and the shortened loop 2 results in a more compact pseudoknot structure even without tertiary interaction with stem 1. Our native PAGE experiment clearly suggests that base triple formation is correlated with the stem 1-loop 2 structural compactness.",

An H-type pseudoknot structure typically unfolds cooperatively at a relatively high force compared to a hairpin37404849. In our force-ramp experiments, all sequences refolded into pseudoknot structures as indicated by the subsequent unfolding traces with a relatively high unfolding force (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S4). More than 95% of pulling cycles showed a one-step unfolding transition during stretching with a force loading rate of about 11 pN/s (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1). Consistent with the force-ramp experiment, the extension versus time traces in the constant-force experiment50 revealed one-step unfolding from pseudoknot to single-stranded conformation (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7b). Clearly, thermal and mechanical unfolding show different pathways (Fig. 5a,b). The extension changes of one-step unfolding transition are consistent with the prediction of the extensible wormlike chain (EWLC) model51 for unfolding of pseudoknots into stretched single strands (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S5). In rare cases, we observed two-step unfolding traces for SF209 (2.0%), SF217 (0.3%), SF220 (1.2%), SF229 (2.8%), and SF348 (5.0%) (see Figs 4b and 5b, and Supplementary Fig. S4j and Table S1). A typical one-step pulling cycle has a large hysteresis, while a typical two-step pulling cycle shows decreased unfolding force and has a decreased hysteresis or is reversible. Varying the force loading rate (5 and 20 pN/s) did not significantly affect the one-step unfolding pathway (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5 for example) and kinetics (data not shown).",

At least one of the two major peaks e and f were present in all 10 simulations, which correspond to the disruption of stem 2 and partial disruption of stem 1-loop 2 triplex and stem 1 (Fig. 6b,e,f). The first small peak (peak d, Fig. 6a) in the force-extension profile is due to the initial disruption of the base pairs in stem 1 and stem 2 (at the two terminal ends of the pseudoknot, Fig. 6b,d). The last small peak g (Fig. 6a) corresponds to the final unfolding stage of the remaining base pairs in stem 1 (Fig. 6b,g).

After the formation of the pseudoknot structure at low forces, the extension versus time (constant-force) trajectory is stable without hopping (Fig. 4d), which is consistent with the fact that pseudoknots have relatively high unfolding forces as previously reported37404849. We observed, based on the extension versus time curves (see Supplementary Fig. S6a), that one of the relatively unstable pseudoknots, SF217, has a lifetime of about tens of seconds for the pseudoknot structure at 15\u201317 pN. The rapid exchange between the single strand and the hairpin conformations suggests that the stem 1 hairpin structure unfolds and folds multiple times before the native pseudoknot structure can form (Fig. 5b). SF348 has a similar folding pattern with a relatively smaller extension change for the transition from the intermediate state to the pseudoknot state (Supplementary Fig. S7a,c) due to the presence of a significantly shortened loop 2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1). We did not observe the intermediate with stem 2-containing hairpin forming. The formation of stem 2-containing hairpin from single strand would result in an extension decrease of about 8\u201310 nm at the force range of 10\u201330 pN, instead of our observed extension decrease of 6\u20137 nm for the first folding step (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). Taken together, stem 1 forms before stem 2 during mechanical folding (Fig. 5b).",

Thus, single-molecule mechanical unfolding studies can reveal the effect of subtle U to C substitution in a loop in a pseudoknot, as has been observed in RNA hairpins containing internal loops in the stems53. The relative mechanical stabilities (SF206 > SF220 > SF217) are consistent with the relative gel mobilities observed in the PAGE experiment (Fig. 3), suggesting that gel mobility correlates with structural compactness and mechanical stability for the pseudoknots of the similar size and with the same stem 1 and stem 2.",

Remarkably, compared to SF217 (A26C), SF229 showed only a small decrease in mean unfolding force (from 27.9 \u00b1 2.2 to 27.1 \u00b1 2.0 pN) (Fig. 7a) and a previously observed moderate frameshifting efficiency decrease (from 6.6% to 2.5%)19. Our single-molecule data suggest the critical role of A26 in stabilizing the stem 1-loop 2 triplex and the pseudoknot, consistent with our PAGE result (Fig. 3). A mutant with a decreased unfolding force typically corresponds to an increased unfolding rate. However, compared to SF217 (A26C), SF229 showed a decrease in lnk0 value (from \u221212.8 \u00b1 1.1 to \u221213.6 \u00b1 1.1 s\u22121) (Fig. 7c). The opposite trends of mean unfolding force and unfolding rate observed for SF217 and SF229 might imply that, due to the force generation by the ribosome on the mRNA structure54555657, the frameshifting efficiency may correlate better with unfolding kinetics at nonzero forces. Indeed, we observed an improved correlation between frameshifting efficiency and mechanical unfolding rates at forces of 20\u201330 pN (Fig. 7c\u2013e, Supplementary Fig. S10). It is also possible that a ribosome exerts its helicase activity by directly acting on some of the loop 2 residues. Thus, compared to other SRV-1 pseudoknots with a purine-rich loop 2, SF229 (with a pyrimidine-rich loop 2) may have varied interactions with the ribosome, which may in turn affect the frameshifting efficiency.",

We tested the effect of the terminal Watson\u2212Crick base pair of stem 1 of SRV-1 pseudoknot (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1), which is directly in contact with the ribosome (Fig. 5c), on the mechanical unfolding and frameshifting19. Consistent with our thermal denaturation data (Fig. 2e) and thermodynamic nearest-neighbor model prediction424344, the mean one-step unfolding forces of SF206, SF209 and SF211 showed the same trend although they are within a small range (33.3 \u00b1 2.2, 31.9 \u00b1 2.1, and 30.5 \u00b1 1.9 pN, respectively) (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. S8). The reported frameshifting efficiencies are 21.0%, 15.3% and 7.8%, respectively, for SF206, SF209, and SF21119. The one-step unfolding rates at zero force, lnk0, of SF206, SF209 and SF211 are \u221215.8 \u00b1 0.9, \u221216.3 \u00b1 1.3 and \u221214.1 \u00b1 1.4 s\u22121, respectively (Fig. 7c). We observed a better correlation between unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency at nonzero forces for SF206, SF209, and SF211 (Fig. 7c\u2013e and Supplementary Fig. S10). As applying stretching force destabilizes the RNA structures, our results imply that stem 1 is destabilized by the translocating ribosome which has helicase activity57 in unwinding mRNA structures. Thus, the 5\u2032 terminal base pairs in stem 1, which is in direct contact with the translocating ribosome, can modulate mechanical stability of the pseudoknot and thus frameshifting efficiency, consistent with previous studies on the frameshift-inducing HIV-1 hairpin17 and antisense oligonucleotides23. Thus, frameshifting can be stimulated by enhancing the local stability of the base pairs positioned at the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome (Fig. 5c) through (i) directly improving the local base pairing interactions and (ii) indirect energetic coupling by triplex formation.",

The mean one-step unfolding forces have a positive correlation with in vitro frameshifting efficiencies. The unfolding rate constant extracted from Bell\u2019s model showed an inverse correlation with in vitro frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 7a\u2013e, Supplementary Figs S9, and S10 and Tables S1 and S2). Importantly, we note that the inverse correlation between the one-step unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency was clearly observed in a broad range of forces from 0 to 40 pN (Fig. 7c\u2013e and Supplementary Fig. S10). An improved correlation was observed when the forces were closer to the unfolding forces (15\u201335 pN), consistent with the fact that a ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity54555657. For example, by applying mechanical stretching force on the translating E. coli ribosome and the 3\u2032 end of an unstructured mRNA, it has been estimated that an actively translating E. coli ribosome can resist a force of about 13 pN55. It is in reasonable agreement with an improved correlation between frameshifting efficiency and SRV-1 mRNA pseudoknot unfolding kinetics when the forces are closer to the unfolding forces (15\u201335 pN). The discrepancy of the force magnitudes (resistant force of 13 pN for E. coli ribosome versus SRV-1 mRNA pseudoknot unfolding force of 15\u201335 pN) may be due to the reasons shown below. (i) As a ribosome is a large RNA-protein complex, it is likely that the resistant force of the ribosome is highly dependent on the points of the applied force. (ii) The frameshifting efficiencies for SRV-1 pseudoknots were previously measured for an eukaryotic ribosome (using a commercially available in vitro translation system)19. (iii) During ribosomal frameshifting, a ribosome in contact with a downstream frameshifting stimulatory mRNA structure can pause seconds to minutes and change its conformation3031323334 to facilitate the unwinding of highly stable mRNA structures including pseudoknots. The distances between the folded state and unfolding transition state (X\u2021) showed no correlation with frameshifting efficiencies and are about 2 nm for all pseudoknots (Fig. 7f), which is consistent with the previous results on the unfolding of human telomerase RNA and other pseudoknots3848.",

            "text": "In contrast to a stepwise thermal unfolding process, the applied mechanical stretching force facilitates cooperative mechanical unfolding of the SRV-1 pseudoknots (Fig. 5b). Although, the directions and points of the applied force may not be the same as those of the force generated by a ribosome (Fig. 5b,c), our single-molecule mechanical unfolding results provide unique insights into how compaction of a pseudoknot through coaxial stacking and stem-loop interactions may stabilize the component stems. The single-molecule mechanical unfolding results of SRV-1 pseudoknots suggest that the cooperative mean unfolding force has a positive correlation with \u22121 frameshifting efficiency when the slippery sequence and the spacer are maintained largely constant, consistent with previous studies3537. However, the possible correlation between mechanical unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency has not been extensively investigated, due to a limited number of mutants studied or a small number of pulling traces obtained for the native pseudoknots35363739. We showed in this study that the cooperative mechanical unfolding rates of the seven SRV-1 pseudoknots studied are inversely proportional to frameshifting efficiencies in a wide range of stretching forces. An improved correlation was observed at the stretching forces of 15\u201335 pN, consistent with the fact that ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity54555657.",
