One example is HIV, where prevalence is 6% in sub-Saharan Africa but only 0.3% in Western Europe [2]. A less striking but still significant example is hepatitis A (HA). HA is a non-endemic, low-incidence disease in the US and Canada, but is highly endemic in many other countries [3-6]. The average reported HA incidence in Canada was 6.3 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1994 [7], and the average reported HA incidence in the US was 10.5 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1999 [8]. By comparison, in 1990, reported incidence ranged from 20 to 60 per 100,000 per year in Africa and the Middle East (depending on the country), 10 to 30 in Asia, and 20 to 40 in Central and South America [9]. Moreover, reported incidence significantly underestimates actual incidence due to under-reporting and subclinical infection [6,8,10]. Because subclinical infection is more common in children, who are infected more frequently in developing countries than developed countries, the global differential in true infection levels is much higher than for reported incidence.",

In the US, after vaccination was implemented (with universal vaccination in the states with highest incidence), the reported incidence had declined to 3.7 per 100,000 per year by 2001 [14,15].

This issue has implications for policy, since it implies that health interventions in one country may potentially influence health outcomes in other countries. This question also has implications not only for hepatitis A but for many diseases such as SARS, as burgeoning air travel turns local problems into global problems. In this paper, we develop mathematical (age-structured compartmental) models of hepatitis A transmission and vaccination in Canada and the US. We use travel data to couple the two countries epidemiologically through travel. We focus on these two countries (rather than attempting a global model) because of the relatively good availability of data for the US and Canada and the close relationship of Canada to the US. The coupled model allows us to analyze how transmission and vaccination in the US may be affecting HA incidence in Canada.",

In Canada and the US, unlike most developing countries, hepatitis A is transmitted mostly by person-to-person contact, by the fecal-oral route [10]. Unlike in many countries, foodborne outbreaks are very infrequent in Canada [18]. Children play an important role in transmission due to their higher rates of subclinical infection and poor hygiene [19]. Clinical illness typically lasts four weeks, there is no chronic state of infection [20], and natural immunity is lifelong. Although 70% of infected post-adolescents develop jaundice, many do not seek medical attention [10,21]. Individuals with symptomatic HA infection experience nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain and jaundice [21]. Hepatitis A infection is more severe in older individuals or those with co-morbidities such as chronic liver disease [22,23]. The most serious possible complication of hepatitis A infection is fulminant hepatic failure. The rate of mortality attributable to HA varies from 0.2% in symptomatic young adults to 1.7% in symptomatic individuals 60 years and older [24].",

Exposed individuals enter the infectious compartment at rate \u03b4, and infectious individuals of age class i enter the recovered compartment at rate \u03b3i, thereafter retaining lifelong immunity. Individuals in age class i are vaccinated at per capita rate giUS thereby entering the vaccinated compartment. The 'US' superscript denotes that this parameter value is specific to the US. Vaccinated individuals lose their immunity at per capita rate f, re-entering the susceptible compartment. Individuals are born susceptible at rate bUS, die at rate diUS, and age at rate ai. Maternal immunity is short-lived and affects relatively few individuals in a non-endemic country such as Canada, so we do not include it [10].

Hence, the Canadian model is identical except there are three possible sources of infection instead of two: domestic transmission (\u03b2ijC), travel to endemic countries (\u03c4i,endC), and travel to the US (\u03c4i,USC). There are no data on what proportion of reported HA cases in Canada are attributable to travel in the US.

These parameters can be obtained from published data [3] or from travel data available on government agency websites [32]. The difference between Canadian incidence and US/endemic incidence is used since that is proportional to the marginal increase in infection risk to Canadian residents traveling in other countries. For instance, if Canadian incidence were 5 per 100,000 per year, and US incidence changed from 10 per 100,000 per year to 15 per 100,00 per year (due to more foodborne outbreaks in that country, for example), then the additional risk of infection per year that Canadian residents assume upon themselves due to travel to the US would double. We note that Equation 1 does not take all possible factors into account. For instance, individual behaviour may vary, since Canadian residents are perhaps more risk-averse when traveling in an endemic country than when traveling in the US.

The choice of 1995 as the year that vaccination begins is motivated by the fact that 1994 was the last year before HA vaccine became widely available in the US and Canada.

This, coupled with the enormous annual volume of Canadian travel to the US compared to endemic countries, means that the US could be a more significant source of travel-related infection (particularly for hepatitis A) than previously recognized. Indeed, the results in the previous section illustrate the potential impact of hepatitis A transmission and vaccination in the US on HA prevalence in Canada. Simulation results based on the assumptions in Equation 1 show that a significant proportion (22%) of HA incidence in the mid 1990's, before vaccination was introduced, may have been attributable to travel in the US. Hence, some of the declines in HA incidence observed after 1994 in Canada (Figure 2) may partly be due to the start of universal vaccination in the higher-incidence regions of the US in the mid-1990s.",

Firstly, these results assume the contribution due to travel in the US is similar to the contribution due to travel to endemic countries, adjusted for the total passenger-days in those respective destinations as well as the difference in incidence between Canada and the respective destination (Equation 1). Moreover, here we have neglected cohort effects for the sake of simplicity [33]. In reality, the age-structured seroprevalence profile for hepatitis A exhibits a cohort effect, whereby the seroprevalence in older age classes is higher than can be explained by the current force of infection (thus implying that the force of infection was higher in the past). The existence of a cohort effect influences how the disease can be modeled. In particular, if the cohort effect is neglected and it is assumed that transmission rates have always been constant, then the dynamic model will overpredict the average population incidence both before and after vaccination, and will also overpredict the percentage reduction in incidence due to vaccination [33]. Finally, there is social heterogeneity within countries in risk factors and transmission patterns for hepatitis A that may be important for modelling certain aspects of disease transmission. Geographical heterogeneity in travel destinations of Canadian traveling to the US may also be important.",

However, our model solutions do not oscillate. Non-seasonal oscillations in models are often associated with endemic diseases, and the period of oscillation (time between peaks) can even be predicted successfully from models [31]. In the case of these models, setting the travel transmission rates to zero for both the US and Canada caused the infection to die out, suggesting that hepatitis A was not endemic in these two countries for the period 1980\u20131994, the time for which the model was parameterized. The fact that HA incidence oscillated during this time suggests that some third endemic region with a natural period of seven years was driving both the US and Canada. This endemic region may be constituted by Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries, with which both the US and Canada have strong travel links. Possible extensions of the present work include a multi-region model where one region is endemic and drives outbreak patterns in other regions. This would allow the model to capture, for instance, US residents who return from endemic countries and travel to Canada shortly thereafter. However, the data requirements for such a model would be significantly greater.",

Like the present model, these models have mostly been deterministic, age-structured compartmental models. Some have structured the population along social [34] or, like the present study, geographic lines [14,36]. Those models predicting or estimating the effects of universal vaccination report declines in incidence due to universal vaccination that are similar in magnitude to those found by the present model [14,15,36,37]. Several of the models also included a cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis [35,37]. Van Effelterre and colleagues included transmission across regions in the United States in a preliminary way, as part of the sensitivity analysis of their model of US hepatitis A transmission and vaccination [36]. They found that the benefits of universal vaccination across the entire US, compared to the benefits of region-specific strategies according to regional HAV incidence, were less important with transmission among regions than without. However, there were still benefits in terms of the number of cases averted by universal vaccination across the entire US with transmission among regions. They did not incorporate travel data into their model. To our knowledge, the present model is the first to incorporate transmission of hepatitis A between countries due to international travel by residents.",

Other modelling work illustrates how nonvaccinators in a population can \"free-ride\" by taking advantage of the herd immunity provided by vaccinators [38-41]. This has been compared to a Prisoner's Dilemma (wherein vaccinators are \"cooperators\" and nonvaccinators are \"defectors\") and analyzed using game theory [39-41]. In the same way, entire countries can also \"free-ride\" by benefiting from vaccination programmes carried out in and funded by other countries.

This is then modified using the typical duration of infectiousness to obtain IiUS. The reported incidence per year per 100,000 for the years 1980\u20131999 is, by age class, y1US=8.2,y2US=18.7,y3US=12.2,y4US=18.5,y5US=12.2,y6US=4.7,y7US=4.7[8].

Finally, we must modify YiUS once again since it represents the number of cases per 100,000 per year, not the total number of cases at a given time during the year.

A previous study estimates that, to date, about 7% of the Canadian population has been vaccinated under this programme (which also vaccinates travelers to endemic countries) (Bauch et al, unpublished data). Hence, we assume in this paper a 7% coverage rate for each age class. Although the actual coverage rates across age classes under the current targeted policy may be dissimilar, the available data do not allow us to stratify the vaccine coverage rates by age. Hence, we have assumed the same vaccination rate applies to each age class. We note that there are also other heterogeneities in vaccine coverage (e.g., social) that the present model was not designed to address.
