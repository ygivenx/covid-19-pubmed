Accumulating evidence from studies in adults [5,6] and children [7,8] suggest that a low capacity for IFN-\u03b3 production in response to NTHi may contribute to the cycle of infection and inflammation associated with the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to impaired immune responses and the pathogenesis of CSLD are important for the development of intervention therapies. The mechanisms leading to the impaired NTHi-driven IFN-\u03b3 response described in children and adults have not been investigated. The innate immune response helps drive the adaptive immune response (e.g. NTHi-driven IFN-\u03b3 response) however, our previous work showed limited evidence of impaired innate immune responses to NTHi in children with CSLD/bronchiectasis [8]. Thus, the current study focuses on possible downstream factors associated with impaired systemic NTHi-driven IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

Severe acute inflammation and chronic infection can disrupt macrophage and T-cell activation and subsequently induce an environment of immune tolerance or exhaustion [9,10]. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that lung and systemic immune responses may be inter-related [11,12]. Given these associations, in this prospective study involving 70 young children with CSLD/bronchiectasis, we investigated whether inflammation (local and systemic) is related to the capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to NTHi. We hypothesised that an impaired systemic ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to NTHi is associated with lung or systemic inflammation. The most notable finding from this study was that NTHi-specific IFN-\u03b3 production by blood mononuclear cells was associated with inflammation.",

All children were clinically stable (defined as absence of recent exacerbation) and under the care of a specialist paediatrician at the time of sample collection. Radiographic diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made by the respiratory paediatrician (AC) and the severity of bronchiectasis scored using a modified Bhalla scale as previously done [13]. The total score was the sum of the score for each lobe, including lingula, based on the extent of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickness and dilation (maximum score 48). Routine clinical investigations [14] were undertaken in all children evaluated for bronchiectasis. Clinical and socio-demographic data were collected using standardised data collection forms. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical and research investigations were collected immediately prior to chest CT scan/bronchoscopy as previously described [8].

Our earlier study[8] documented a log-fold increase in IFN-\u03b3 production between healthy controls aged <18 months compared to those >18 months, consistent with normal maturation of the Th1 response through early childhood. However, in the CSLD group, we found a significantly lower capacity for IFN-\u03b3 production over the same age dynamic.

Consistent with this, we found a strong correlation between levels of BAL IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IP-10 in children with CSLD. IL-6 plays a complex role in the inflammatory response, from promoting inflammation to wound healing. Dysregulation of IL-6 is associated with chronic inflammation). In addition to its inflammatory modulating properties, IL-6 is integral to initiating the adaptive response and in directing its primary phenotype. In the lung, IL-6 polarises the adaptive immune response in favour of the humoral response. Animal and in vitro studies indicate this is accomplished in two ways. Firstly, dendritic cell-derived IL-6 suppresses activation of the Th1 pathway by inhibiting IL-12 production [22,23]. Secondly IL-6, in synergy with macrophage-derive IP-10, promotes the differentiation of B-cells into antibody-producing plasma cells [24]. Minimal numbers of lymphocytes in our BAL samples precluded our ability to study airway cells directly, however our data are consistent with the hypothesis that localised immune responses may not be contained to the lungs. We found that IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IP-10 were positively correlated with each other. Furthermore BAL IL-1\u03b2 was positively associated with BAL IL-13. An environment high in these cytokines is conducive to a polarised humoral immune response. Thus it is plausible that the low systemic capacity for NTHi-specific IFN-\u03b3 production, also associated with BAL IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, may be a reflection of prolonged humoral responses in the lungs.",
