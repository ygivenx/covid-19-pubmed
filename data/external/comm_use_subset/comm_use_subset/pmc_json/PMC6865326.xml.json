Fourth, in the absence of boosting from wild-type disease, vaccine-induced antibody titers are known to decline over time,8 and vaccinated persons are potentially susceptible to infection and disease as a result of waning immunity.9 The ability of vaccine nonresponders and of individuals with waning immunity to transmit measles is poorly understood.",

Sustaining measles elimination requires maintenance of R below the threshold value of 1. If R is greater than 1, on average, each person spreads measles to more than 1 other person, and a self-sustaining outbreak can occur; by contrast, if R is less than 1, on average, each person spreads measles to less than 1 other person, and transmission cannot be sustained. Building on previous analyses,12,13 we adapted an existing algorithm14,15 that uses a maximum likelihood procedure to infer R for each case, or cohort of cases, given the time in days between cases in an outbreak and the probability density function of the serial interval (time between the onset of symptoms in primary cases of measles and the secondary cases they generate).14,15 We used a serial interval for measles derived from household transmission studies with a \u03b3 probability distribution and a mean (SD) of 11.1 (2.5) days.16 In brief, in any given measles case series, the weight that patient i infected patient j, Wij, is the serial interval distribution applied to the number of days between the rash onsets of patients i and j, and the probability that patient j was infected by patient i, Pij, is given by Pij = Wij/(\u2211kWkj), where the sum in the denominator is over all potential infectors k of patient j. The estimate of the R for patient i is Ri = \u2211jPij (eMethods in the Supplement).",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. The algorithm14,15 does not conclusively establish who infected whom and cannot replace careful epidemiologic investigation, but it is useful in identifying the overall direction of transmission. Because the likelihood of transmission depends on several factors, including the status (eg, vaccination) of both the infector and infectee, the setting in which the exposure occurred, and outbreak containment interventions, it is challenging to account for the effect of each potential confounder. For example, we did not directly evaluate the association of population density with transmission of measles, although our analysis of superspreading events indicates that close-contact settings provide opportunities for rapid dissemination of measles. Similarly, we did not evaluate the association of clustering with transmission of measles, and geographic clustering of unvaccinated persons has been linked to measles outbreaks.24,29,30 Unvaccinated primary cases of measles were more likely to infect unvaccinated rather than vaccinated individuals, whereas vaccinated primary cases of measles infected a similar number of unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the range of R values during superspreading events was similar to the commonly cited range of values for R0.27 Both observations imply that there are pockets of underimmunization in the United States. The date of vaccine receipt was poorly populated in our data set (available for approximately 36% of vaccinated cases), and our results of no difference in transmissibility by age at first dose and time since vaccination were based on few cases. These findings were also confounded by lack of differentiation between primary and secondary vaccine failure, which requires specialized testing (avidity and neutralizing antibody titers). However, our analyses suggest that vaccinated persons are inefficient transmitters of measles, and we found no notable differences in transmissibility between vaccinated individuals with measles with and without reported vaccination dates (eTable 13 in the Supplement). The outbreaks we evaluated occurred in diverse populations and were affected by several individual- and context-specific factors; thus, the relative importance of the different factors associated with transmission might not be generalizable. Finally, our comparisons of R values were qualitative and not statistical, although clear differences in transmissibility were noted and explained by underlying covariates.",
