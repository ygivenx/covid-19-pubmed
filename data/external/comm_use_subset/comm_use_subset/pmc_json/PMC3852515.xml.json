            "text": "Contagious upper airway infections in dogs occur regularly and are most commonly caused by canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) or Bordetella bronchiseptica, amongst other agents [1]. This clinical syndrome has also been named infectious tracheobronchitis (ITB), canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), \u201ckennel cough\u201d or \u201ckennel croup\u201d, so named due to its occurrence in environments where many dogs live or stay close together for shorter periods of time. Characteristic clinical signs include a self-limiting paroxysmal cough lasting for up to two weeks, which usually resolves without treatment. In Norway, immunisation against CIRD is performed using live attenuated viruses, annually with CPIV and every third year against canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) [1]. However, in spite of vaccination, outbreaks of CIRD remain common. Some dogs with CIRD will develop serious pneumonia due to an immature immune system or other causes of immunodeficiency. Occasionally, bacteria such as Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus can cause fatal pneumonia [2-8].",

Three days after the sled race the dogs were given a commercial polyvalent canine vaccine containing CDV, CAV-2, CPV, CPIV, CCoV and leptospira. Clinical signs of respiratory disease were observed four days after vaccination. Immunosuppression in dogs immunised with a similar polyvalent vaccine was reported by Phillips and others [9]. They demonstrated that the absolute lymphocyte count in blood was suppressed on day five and seven following immunisation and that one group of dogs immunised with CDV and CAV-2 also had decreased lymphocyte count on day three post vaccination. All the dogs produced neutralising antibodies to canine distemper virus and some parts of the natural immunity were not influenced by the vaccination. However, the immunisation with polyvalent vaccines significantly suppressed the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin, a mitogen that induce proliferation in T-lymphocytes in vitro on day 5, 7 and 11 post inoculation, but returned to normal response level by day 14 following immunisation. The combination of CDV/canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) or CDV/CAV-2 was believed to be responsible for the suppression in lymphocyte responsiveness. The duration of the suppressed lymphocyte response was at least seven days and was most pronounced on day 7 post inoculation with up to 90% suppression of mitogen-induced lymphocyte response compared to control dogs. In the present study, the use of modified live polyvalent canine vaccine combined with stress associated with training, competition and prolonged transportation may have suppressed the innate immune response to S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, which seldom causes pathology in dogs. The possibility of a co-infection with viral pathogens cannot be excluded and may have contributed to this outbreak.",

Some of these papers report the use of CDV/CAV-2 vaccine prior to infection with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus[3] or a possible dual infection with CDV [4], though do not postulate that immunosuppression due to vaccination with modified live polyvalent canine vaccine is significant in this pathogenesis.",

This study was not specific to athletes, as they are thought to have a better physical health status compared with the general population.
