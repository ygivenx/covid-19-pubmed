            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a process where specific signals in the messenger RNA (mRNA) direct the translating ribosome to shift the reading frame. Many viruses including HIV-1 employ the programmed ribosomal frameshifting to control the ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. When the reading frame is shifted by one base in the 3\u2032 direction it is called +1 frameshifting, while when the reading frame is shifted by one base in the 5\u2032 direction it is called \u22121 frameshifting [8], [9], [10], [11]. It was characterized that the amino acid starvation, i.e., the limitation for particular amino acids, can induce the +1 frameshifting [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The \u22121 frameshifting often occurs at the slippery sequence with a form of X_XXY_YYZ on the presence of a downstream mRNA pseudoknot, where codons are shown in the initiation reading frame, with dashes separating in-frame triplets [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [14], [15], [16], [17]. In some prokaryotic cases, an additional stimulatory signal\u2014an upstream, internal Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD) sequence\u2014is also necessary to stimulate the efficient \u22121 frameshifting. For example, the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli has three stimulatory signals\u2014an SD sequence, an A_AAA_AAG slippery sequence and a downstream stem loop or hairpin [11], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].",

            "text": "To understand how the \u22121 frameshifting is stimulated at the slippery sequence on the presence of the downstream mRNA pseudoknot, several models have been proposed. Leger et al. [22] proposed that the \u22121 frameshifting occurs when deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA) is located in the E/E site, the peptidyl-tRNA located in the P/P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA located in the A/T entry site. Plant et al. [23] proposed a 9 \u00c5 model, which is based on the proposal of a movement of 9 \u00c5 by the anticodon loop of the aminoacyl-tRNA between the A/T state of initial binding and the A/A state of the full accommodation. The movement induces the \u22121 frameshifting. Based on the cryo-EM imaging of the mammalian 80S ribosome stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure which contains a structurally distorted tRNA in A/P\u2032 hybrid state [24], [25]. Namy et al. proposed that the stereochemical mismatch between the pseudoknot structure and the entrance geometry of the mRNA channel blocks the entry of the downstream mRNA, causing a tension in the mRNA that bends the tRNA in a (+) sense (3\u2032) direction. As a result, the codon-anticodon interaction breaks over the slippery sequence, allowing a spring-like relaxation of the tRNA in a (\u2212) sense (5\u2032) direction and thus causing the tRNA to re-pair with the mRNA in the \u22121 position. Based on the above three models, Liao et al. [26] developed a kinetic model which proposes that the \u22121 frameshifting can occur during the translocation step, as proposed in the model by Leger et al. [22] and that by Namy et al. [24], and/or the aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation step, as proposed in the model by Plant et al. [23]. Recently, Bailey et al. [27] developed a mathematical model that treats mRNA translation and associated \u22121 frameshifting as a stochastic process in which the transition probabilities are based on the energetics of local molecular interactions, with which the location and efficiency of \u22121 frameshift events in HIV-1 were studied. We proposed another model for the dynamics of the \u22121 frameshifting during the translation of the mRNA containing the slippery sequence and downstream mRNA pseudoknot [28], where a systematical analysis of the \u22121 frameshifting that can occur during every transition step in the elongation phase showed that the \u22121 frameshifting takes place mainly during the translocation over the sequence, as proposed by Namy et al. [24], and simultaneously provided a consistent explanation of a lot of available independent experimental data.",

[29] made a detailed experimental study of the dynamics of the \u22121 frameshifting during translation of the dnaX \u22121 frameshift mRNA by using single-molecule fluorescence to track directly the compositional and conformational dynamics of individual ribosomes at each codon. Based on their observations they proposed a model of dynamic pathway of the dnaX \u22121 frameshifting (see Fig. S1). In the model, the stochastic interaction of the ribosome with the hairpin helix in an open or closed state and/or formation of the SD and antiSD pairing interaction represent the shunt to either pausing in the rotated state or normal translation. If the hairpin is in open state, the translocation of the ribosomes with the normal translation is coupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation. If the hairpin is in closed state, the translocation of the paused ribosomes is uncoupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation (called \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation), causing the ribosomes to enter into the long-paused rotated state. However, a quantitative calculation showed that the opening probability of the hairpin helix is only 5.5\u00d710\u22124 (see Section S1), which significantly deviates from the observation showing that about 25% fraction of the ribosomes undergo the normal translation [29]. Then, what is the molecular mechanism of the hairpin and the SD and inti-SD interaction stimulating the shunt to either the long-paused rotated state or the normal translation? Moreover, as the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation involves no reverse intersubunit rotation, then how the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation occurs is unclear. In the long-paused rotated state, the detailed mechanism of how elongation factor G (EF-G) and tRNA compete for the binding to the ribosome and how the rotated state is finally resolved by EF-G, etc., is also not clear.",

We begin with just after the peptidyl transfer, with deacylated tRNA in the P/P site and the peptidyl-tRNA in the A/A site (State C0). Before EF-G.GTP binding, the labile ribosome allows the spontaneous counterclockwise (viewed from the exterior of the 30S) rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit and vice verse, which are called forward and reverse intersubunit rotations, respectively. The spontaneous intersubunit rotations result in the ribosomal complex to transit from the non-rotated State C0 to rotated or hybrid State H0 and vice verse. The two states are in thermodynamic equilibrium, with the majority being in State H0 [37], [38], [39]. Since in both State C0 and State H0 the 30S A site is occupied, the binding of the ternary complex is not allowed. EF-G.GTP can bind to the labile State C0 and State H0 [49], [50], [51], [52]. (i) If EF-G.GTP binds to State H0 (becoming State H1), after rapid GTP hydrolysis the ribosomal unlocking occurs, opening the mRNA channel and the 30S subunit (State H2). The subsequent reverse intersubunit rotation makes the 30S subunit move downstream relative to the mRNA that is coupled with the two tRNAs by one codon, while the high affinity of the 50S E and P sites for the two tRNAs [44], [45] fixes the two tRNAs to the 50S subunit. This results in the transition of State H2 to posttranslocation state (State POST). Facilitated by the ribosomal unlocking, Pi is also released rapidly and independently of the reverse intersubunit rotation [43]. (ii) If EF-G.GTP binds to State C0 (becoming State C), the transition from State C to State H1 is facilitated mildly [39] and the hybrid State H1 is then stabilized [35], [36], [39]. Since the EF-G-facilitated transition from State C to State H1 (with a rate <10 s\u22121\n[39], [53]) is much slower than GTP hydrolysis (with a rate of about 250 s\u22121\n[43]), GTP hydrolysis occurs mainly at State C and State H1 is in EF-G.GDP.Pi form, consistent with the available experimental data [54]. In State H1 the ribosomal unlocking occurs (becoming State H2). Then, the reverse intersubunit rotation results in the transition of State H2 to State POST.",

The subsequent codon recognition (State 4) induces closing of the 30S subunit and triggers GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis and Pi release (State 5), resulting in a large-scale conformational change of EF-Tu to the GDP-bound form (State 6).

However, if the downstream duplex is present, due to the competition between the free energy change of unwinding three mRNA base pairs and that of breaking the interaction of the two tRNAs with the 50S E and P sites, two possibilities of transitions from State H2 can be caused by the reverse intersubunit rotation (Fig. 2) [55].

State FC and State FH have similar structures to State C and State H1, respectively. The differences between them are that State FC and State FH are bound with EF-G.GDP while State C and State H1 are bound with EF-G.GTP or EF-G.GDP.Pi. In the model (Fig. 2), the ribosome uses only one mechanism to unwind the mRNA duplex [55], rather than uses two mechanisms as proposed by Qu et al. [56]. As shown before, with the consideration of the futile translocation various single-molecule experimental data such as the optical-trapping data on the rate and dwell-time distribution of translation through the mRNA duplex versus the pulling force to unzip the duplex [56], [57] and the smFRET (single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer) data on the dynamics of slow dissociation of deacylated tRNA from the E site induced by the downstream secondary structures [58] can be explained quantitatively [55], [59], [60]. In particular, the recent high-resolution smFRET data of Kim et al. [61] give a strong support to the futile translocation, which showed that when translates through the mRNA containing the downstream stem loop the ribosomal complex exhibits multiple fluctuations between the classical non-rotated state (State FC in Fig. 2) and hybrid state (State FH, State H1 and State H2) before undergoing mRNA translocation (State POST) at saturating EF-G, whereas when translates through the mRNA lacking the stem loop the ribosomal complex samples the hybrid state (State H1 and State H2) only once before undergoing mRNA translocation [62]. In addition, the consideration of the futile translocation is consistent with the proposal of futile elongation factor 2 (eEF2) cycling during ribosomal translocation in 80S ribosome with the presence of mRNA secondary structures by Flanagan et al. [25].",

After EF-G.GDP release, since the ribosome in State FS1 is in labile state EF-G.GTP can bind, and since the 30S subunit is in the open conformation the ternary complex can also bind efficiently. Thus, both EF-G.GTP and the ternary complex compete for the binding to State FS1, which is consistent with the single-molecule data [29]. First, consider EF-G.GTP binding. In the open conformation of the 30S subunit, the binding of EF-G.GTP and then GTP hydrolysis is inefficient to induce the ribosomal unlocking. Without ribosomal unlocking facilitating the reverse intersubunit rotation, the ribosome is kept in the rotated conformation during the reaction cycle of EF-G.GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis, Pi release and then EF-G.GDP release.",

If the arriving tRNA is cognate to codon YYZ, the codon recognition will facilitate the peptidyl-tRNA to shift the reading frame from codon XXX (State FS2) to codon XXY (State NF2). If the arriving tRNA is cognate to codon YYY, no shift of the reading frame of the peptidyl-tRNA will occur. Thus, whether the \u22121 frameshifting can occur or not is determined mainly by the arriving tRNAs in State FS2, which is in turn determined by their magnitudes in the binding affinity to the ribosome and the relative concentrations in solution. The codon recognition induces the open 30S subunit transiting to closed conformation, triggering GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis and Pi release (State FS3). The resultant conformational change of EF-Tu induces the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-Tu.GDP release (State FS4). Note that during the codon recognition, i.e., before the 30S subunit becoming closed, the aminoacyl-tRNA can be dissociated [63], [64], returning to State FS1. Note also that after the codon recognition, i.e., after the 30S subunit becoming closed, but before the completion of the accommodation, the aminoacyl-tRNA can also be dissociated [63], [64], with State FS3 transiting to State FS5. For the ribosome in the non-canonical rotated conformation, the probabilities of the aminoacyl-tRNA dissociation in the two steps could be much larger than those for the ribosome in the canonical non-rotated conformation due partially to the fact that in the non-canonical rotated state the process of the codon recognition and that of the accommodation could be elongated greatly. Thus, multiple bindings of the ternary complex can occur in the stalled rotated state, which is consistent with the single-molecule data [29]. Since in State FS5 the 30S subunit is in the closed conformation, the ternary complex cannot bind efficiently, but EF-G.GTP binds efficiently. As the 30S subunit is now in the closed conformation, the GTP hydrolysis can induce efficiently the ribosomal unlocking (State FS6), inducing the 30S subunit transiting to open conformation and facilitating the reverse intersubunit rotation and Pi release. Due to the specific affinity of the 50S P site for the peptidyl-tRNA and the resistance of the mRNA duplex to the downstream movement of the 30S subunit, the reverse intersubunit rotation would cause the rotated State FS6 transiting to non-rotated State FS7, where the mRNA channel becomes tight. Then, the transitions from State FS7 to State C0 (indicated by the green arrow) are the same as those (inside the region bounded by broken lines) in Fig. 1.",

The transition to State POST requires overcoming the free energy change (3Ebp) of unwinding three mRNA base pairs and the free energy change (\u0394ESD(3)) of the SD-antiSD interaction induced by the movement of the ribosome from the position (with d=0) where the SD and antiSD have the largest interacting energy to the position (with d=3p, p=3.4 nm) where the SD and antiSD have nearly no interaction. The transition to State FC requires overcoming the binding energy (EPE(50S)) of the 50S E and P sites to the two tRNAs. The transition to State LP requires overcoming four free energy changes including the free energy change (2Ebp) of unwinding two mRNA base pairs, the free energy change (\u0394Ecodon) of shifting the peptidyl-tRNA anticodon from pairing with codon XXY to pairing with codon XXX and breaking the interaction between deacylated tRNA anticodon and codon BCX, the free energy change (\u0394tRNA) of bending the P-site peptidyl-tRNA in State LP, and the free energy change (\u0394ESD(2)) of the SD-antiSD interaction which is induced by the movement of the ribosome from the position with d=0 where the SD and antiSD have the largest interacting energy to the position with d=2p where the SD and antiSD have a smaller interacting energy, with \u0394ESD(2)<\u0394ESD(3). The transition to State LP implies the occurrence of the long-paused rotated state. Thus, the occurrence probability of State LP caused by one reverse intersubunit rotation is calculated by(1)PLP(1)=exp[\u2212\u03b2(\u0394E+\u0394ESD(2)+2Ebp)]exp[\u2212\u03b2(\u0394E+\u0394ESD(2)+2Ebp)]+exp[\u2212\u03b2(\u0394ESD(3)+3Ebp)]+exp(\u2212\u03b2EPE(50S)),where \u0394E=\u0394Ecodon+\u0394tRNA and \u03b2\u22121=kBT is the thermal energy.

The single-molecule experimental data [29] showed that at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA24) of the WT mRNA, where both the SD-antiSD interaction and the downstream hairpin are present, the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is 75%; for the mutant mRNA without the internal SD sequence, which corresponds to \u0394\u0394ESD=0 in Eq.

The fitted value of Ebp=2.5kBT implies that the free energy change of unwinding one mRNA base pair is about 1.5 kcal/mol, which is close to the value estimated in the literature [65].",

            "text": "Based on the experimental data, Chen et al. [29] proposed a model of the elongation pathway for translation at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA24) where both the SD-antiSD interaction and the downstream hairpin are present (see Fig. S1). The model argued that the translocation that is uncoupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation (called \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation) can occur at codon AAA24 and the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation is the +3 translocation (i.e., the downstream translocation of the ribosome by 3 nucleotides along the mRNA). According to this model, for the AAG(AAA) mutant, i.e., changing AAG27 codon to AAA27 (Fig. 5a), after the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation the peptidyl-tRNALys(AAA24) codon pair is in the P site and the AAA27 codon is in the A site that is now available for aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Since whether after the \u22121 slippage or not the codon in the A site is always AAA, both the AAA26 codon (\u22121 frame) and AAA27 codon (0 frame) have the same interaction energy with the aminoacyl-tRNALys. Thus, it would be expected that in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation (Fig. S1), the probability of the translation in 0 frame should be larger than or at least equal to that of the translation in \u22121 frame. However, this is inconsistent with the experimental data [29], as discussed below. The experimental data [29] showed that for the WT mRNA about FUT=71\u201375% fraction of the elongating ribsosmes proceed in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation (with 71% of elongating ribosomes exhibiting>4 Cy5-tRNALsy pulses or with the frameshifting percentage of about 75%) and for the AAG(AAA) mutant mRNA the \u20131 frameshifting percentage is about FFS=49%. Since for both the WT mRNA and AAG(AAA) mutant, the elongating ribosomes should have the same fraction (FUT=71\u201375%) that proceed in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation, it is thus expected that for the AAG(AAA) mutant the non-frameshifting percentage is about FNF=FUT\u2212FFS=22\u201326% in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation. In other words, in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation, about 22\u201326% ribosomes that enter the stalled state do not frameshift, while the experimental data [29] showed that about 49% ribosomes that enter the stalled state frameshift, with the former being about 2-fold smaller than the latter. This is inconsistent with the deduction from the experimental data showing that for the AAG(AAA) mutant, in the pathway of the \u201cuncoupled\u201d translocation, the probability of the translation in 0 frame should be larger than or at least equal to that of the translation in \u22121 frame (see just above). The inconsistency thus argues against the +3 translocation proposal.",

For other mutant sequences such as the AAG(UUU) mutant (changing AAG27 to UUU27) and AAG(AAC) mutant (changing AAG27 to AAC27) with the codon for \u22121 frame in the A site being different from the codon for 0 frame (Fig. 5a), the two codons have different interaction energies with their corresponding cognate tRNAs, which plays an important role in determining the probability of the translation in 0 frame and that of the translation in \u22121 frame in the pathway of the +2 translocation (Fig. 4). This could provide an explanation of the experimental data in Chen et al. [29]. For the WT sequence, the AAA26 codon (\u22121 frame) has the larger interaction strength with the UUU anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNALys than the AAG27 codon (0 frame). Thus, the probability of the translation in \u22121 frame is expected to be much larger than that of the translation in 0 frame in the pathway of the +2 translocation. For the AAG(AAA) mutant, the same AAA codon for \u22121 frame and 0 frame give the same interaction energy with the UUU anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNALys, inducing the probability of the translation in \u22121 frame to be smaller than that for the WT sequence. For the AAG(UUU) mutant, the further reduction of the probability of the translation in \u22121 frame relative to that for the AAG(AAA) mutant [29] could be due to the fact that the UUU27 codon (0 frame) has a stronger interaction than the AUU26 codon (\u22121 frame) with their corresponding cognate tRNAs.",

            "text": "The experimental data on tRNA sampling dynamics and slippage during frameshifting (Extended data Fig. 9 in Chen et al. [29]) are explained as follows. The available biochemical data showed that the binding rate of a near-cognate tRNA is similar to that of the cognate tRNA to the A site of the ribosome [63], [64]. Thus, for the AAG(UUU) mutant, it is expected that after the +2 translocation at codon AAA24, the arrival time of the near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAPhe to the A-site AUU26 codon (\u22121 frame) would be similar to that of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNALys to the A-site AAA26 codon (\u22121 frame) for the WT sequence. Consequently, after the +2 translocation the tRNAPhe arrival time for the AAG(UUU) mutant could be similar to tRNALys arrival time for the WT sequence. Moreover, for the AAG(UUU) mutant, after the binding of tRNAPhe to the A-site AUU26 codon (\u22121 frame) the stronger interaction of the AAA anticodon of tRNAPhe with the UUU codon induces slippage of the two tRNAs to the 0 frames. Consequently, after the +2 translocation at codon AAA24 the mean lifetime of tRNAPhe sampling for the AAG(UUU) mutant could be also similar to that of tRNALys sampling for the WT sequence. In addition, for Cy5-tRNALys transit through the AAG(UUU) mutant, because both the sampling of cognate tRNAIle to the A-site AUU26 codon (\u22121 frame) and the sampling of cognate tRNAPhe to the A-site UUU27 codon (0 frame) are invisible, only three Lys pulses can be observed, consistent with the experimental data [29]. For Cy5-tRNALys transit through the AAG(AAC) mutant, after the +2 translocation at codon AAA24, because the binding rate of the near-cognate tRNAAsn to the A-site AAA26 codon (\u22121 frame) is similar to the cognate tRNALys to the A-site AAA26 codon, about half fraction of Cy5-tRNALys samplings to the A-site AAA26 codon can occur. On the other hand, the +2 translocation contains about 71% fraction of the total translocations [29]. Thus, it is estimated that the probability of observing more than three Lys pulses is about 35%, which is slightly larger than the experimental data of about 25% [29]. Assuming that the Cy5-labeling may reduce the tRNA binding rate, it is expected that the probability of observing more than three Lys pulses is slightly smaller than 35% estimated above.",

As after EF-G.GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis is fast [43], the rate constant k2 is approximately determined only by the binding of EF-G.GTP, with k2=kb(G)[EF-G], where kb(G) is the binding rate of EF-G.GTP to State H0 and [EF-G] the concentration of EF-G.GTP. In addition, the available biochemical data showed that after GTP hydrolysis by EF-G bound to the rotated state, the ribosomal unlocking occurs rapidly, with a rate of about 35 s\u22121\n[43], [67] that is much larger than the binding rate of EF-G.GTP at the concentrations used in the experiment [29]. Moreover, after the ribosomal unlocking the reverse intersubunit rotation is fast [43]. Thus, for approximation, the mean rotated-state lifetime can be calculated by(21)TR1=1kb(G)[EF-G]",

During the transition from State FS through State FS3, the mean lifetime of the rotated state is calculated by N(\u03c4+TtRNA), where N is the mean number of the aminoacyl-tRNA samplings to the long-paused rotated state in Fig. 4, which is calculated by Eq.

The force can be easily realized by using in vitro optical trapping assays (single trap or dual traps), as described below. In the single-trapping assay, the 30S body of the translating ribosome is fixed to a solid surface, while the end of the downstream mRNA is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in the trap. Note that the residues on the 30S body which are fixed to the solid surface should be far away from the mRNA channel, so that the fixing has no effect on the translation activity such as the binding of the ternary complex, codon recognition, mRNA translocation and deacylated tRNA dissociation, etc. We can alternatively use the dual-trapping assay, where the 30S body of the translating ribosome is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in a trap of strong strength, while the end of the downstream mRNA is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in another trap of weak strength.",

            "text": "It is noted that our model can also explain the more recent experimental data that were obtained using the PURExpress in vitro translation system by Yan et al. [30], as discussed below. Based on our model, under large resistance to the forward mRNA translocation arising from the unwinding of the downstream mRNA base pairs and disruption of the upstream SD-antiSD interaction, the codon-anticodon interaction has a large probability to disrupt by reverse intersubunit rotation that occurs after the ribosomal unlocking, as calculations showed before [28]. After the disruption of the codon-anticodon interaction and the SD-antiSD interaction, two scenarios can be expected to occur, with the occurrence probability dependent on the experimental condition. The first and prevalent one in the cell is that the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA immediately forms pairing with codon XXX immediately adjacent to codon XXY (see Fig. 3). This leads to entering into State LP, which corresponds to the experiments of Chen et al. [29]. The other scenario is that the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA does not rapidly form pairing with another codon that is cognate to the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA. The ribosome-tRNA complex then moves randomly relative to the mRNA by the thermal noise until the reformation of the codon-anticodon and SD-antiSD base pairs and then the decoding of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site (during the period the ribosome-tRNA complex having the fixed conformation of the non-rotated 30S head and no intersubunit rotation). This scenario corresponds to the experiments that were conducted using the PURExpress in vitro translation system by Yan et al. [30], showing that multiple translocation excursions occur around the slippery sequence, where both the base-pairing interaction of the downstream mRNA and the upstream SD and antiSD interaction are present, and the ribosome can frameshift from various codon positions around the slippery sequence region. Moreover, it is expected that without the codon-anticodon and SD-antiSD interactions the tRNA can dissociate easily from the ribosome, prematurely terminating the translation, which is also consistent with the experimental data of Yan et al. [30]. Note also that without immediate formation of the codon-anticodon interactions, the bending of the peptidyl-tRNA would not occur and thus the long paused state would not occur. This is also consistent with the experimental data of Yan et al. [30].",

This implies that the forward and backward rotations of the 30S head bring about the forward and backward mRNA translocations, respectively, with the forward 30S head rotation bringing about the forward translocation of mRNA coupled with tRNAs to the posttranslocation position while the backward 30S head rotation bringing about the backward movement of the mRNA. It this proposal is true, it would be expected that during the normal translation, no net mRNA movement can occur by a round of the 30S head rotations (the forward and backward rotations) because at the end of a round of the 30S head rotations or in the posttranslocation state both the 30S body and 30S head are in the non-rotated conformations. This is evidently inconsistent with the fact that in the posttranslocation state the mRNA has moved forwards by one codon relative to the pretranslocation state.",

In the model, the downstream mRNA base pairs and the upstream SD-antiSD interaction impede the downstream translocation of the 30S subunit along the mRNA, inducing the occurrence of futile translocation besides the usually effective translocation at the non-slippery site. At the slippery site, besides the effective and futile translocations, the incomplete +2 translocation can also occur, inducing the ribosome to enter into a long-paused non-canonical rotated state, where the \u22121 frameshifting can occur. An important point to note is that the three translocations\u2014the effective translocation, the futile translocation and the incomplete translocation\u2014are coupled with the same reverse intersubunit rotation that occurs after the ribosomal unlocking.",

The model is also consistent with the experimental data on translocation excursions and broad branching of frameshifting pathways [30]. Moreover, as shown in the next paper [31], with the same model except that the 30S head rotation is included, the biochemical data of Caliskan et al. [32] on the kinetics of EF-G binding and dissociation and on the kinetics of movement of tRNAs inside the ribosome can also be explained quantitatively and well. In addition, we provide predicted results on the dynamics of the \u22121 frameshifting when translation of the mRNA with no internal SD sequence and no hairpin under the external force on the mRNA. The predicted results can be easily tested by future optical trapping experiments.",
