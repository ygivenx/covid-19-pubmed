The oral route represents a major challenge for viruses as they need to overcome a diversity of barriers to invade their host. Indeed, most animal epithelia are covered in their apical surface by a carbohydrate-rich meshwork of various complexity and thickness, the glycocalyx, which can be coated by an additional layer of secreted mucus [2]. These structures constitute successive protective surfaces where viruses aggregate and either access to attachment factors and receptors at the surface of the epithelial cells or are eliminated by luminal or cilia movements [3]. This dual fate depends on the virus affinity for glycans, which must allow to escape the trap of the mucus. The diversity of glycans present on the epithelial surfaces vary between and within species and therefore constitute an important component of the innate immunity and of the species barrier [4].",

The mechanisms determining densovirus specificity are poorly known. Depending on species, densovirus replication can be either restricted to or exclude the gut, viral particles being then transported across the epithelium by transcytosis to reach internal organs where replication goes [11,12,13,14]. Only one cellular receptor has been so far characterized for a \u201cgut restricted\u201d densovirus. It is a mucin of the gut of the silkworm Bombyx mori, whose inactivation makes silkworms resistant to infection with the Bombyx mori densovirus type 1 (BmDV) [15]. We have previously reported that gut transcytosis of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) involves a gut specific receptor-dependent mechanism in caterpillars [12]. However, the mechanisms used by viral particles to overcome the successive intestinal barriers of different structures and composition remain elusive.",

Indeed, anterior and posterior extremities of the gut are ectodermal and the acellular layer is covered by an impermeable cuticle. The midgut section is endodermal and has no cuticle but is covered in most insects by a semi-permeable membrane, named the peritrophic matrix (PM) (for review [16]). The PM forms a highly organized lattice of chitin fibrils associated with glycoproteins, mainly peritrophins that have a chitin-binding domain [17,18]. The midgut is thus the portal of entry for most pathogens and their interaction with the PM a critical step of their pathogenesis.",

Such rapid virus concentration on a carbohydrate-rich surface suggested a lectin-like activities of the capsids. Although there is no sequence similarity of the unique protein making the surface of the JcDV with lectin domains, its structure displays similarities with cellular carbohydrate binding proteins including lectins, which suggests that capsids could indeed recognize and bind carbohydrates [25].",

We found that capsids affinity for the PM might result from multiple interactions with different glycans including chitin and glycosylated proteins. In addition, we showed that JcDV early infection results in (i) an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) secretion by epithelial cells associated with a disorganization of the PM structure mimicking the effect of chitin-binding plant lectin; (ii) substantial changes in the expression of gut genes, which may also contribute to an early gut dysfunction and participate to viral pathogenesis.",

The second digestion with MmeI was performed, which cuts 17 bp downstream of the CATG site. At this point, the fragments detach from the beads. The GEX adapter 2 was ligated to the 3\u2032 end of the tag. A PCR amplification with 15 cycles using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) was performed with primers complementary to the adapter sequences to enrich the samples for the desired fragments. The resulting fragments of 85 bp were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (0.45 \u03bcm), precipitated, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and quantified using Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer. Cluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell. After hybridization of the sequencing primer to the single-stranded products, 18 cycles of base incorporation were carried out on the 1G analyzer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline, where sequence tags were obtained after purity filtering. We could assign 63% of the tags (Supplementary Materials Tables S2\u2013S4) out of which 54% correspond to multiple matches and were discarded from functional analysis with GO.",

We then measured larval mortality rates daily.

To test this hypothesis, we first assayed the capsid ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, a feature displayed by vertebrate parvoviruses [45,46]. We performed a typical hemagglutination assay, adding serial dilutions of the virus inoculum to rabbit erythrocytes (Figure 2). The first dilutions (1:2 and 1:4) of JcDV triggered a strong hemolysis of erythrocytes suggesting a toxic effect of the viral inoculum, ie capsids or some host-derived component associated with the inoculum. It is worthy to note that we use semi-purified inoculum as it mimics naturally occurring infections. JcDV was therefore further purified on a density gradient (P_JcDV) and similarly assayed for hemagglutination. A clear hemagglutination was obtained with P_JcDV, supporting that toxicity is likely due to a host-derived component that can be eliminated during the purification process. Hemagglutination with P_JcDV was obtained up to the third dilution (hemagglutination titer of 1:8), which indicates a rather weak interaction of the capsids with glycans at the surface of (mammalian) erythrocytes.",

We first performed competition ex vivo on isolated PMs incubated with JcDV in the presence of four monosaccharides commonly found in insects [47], ie N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), which is the monomeric unit of chitin, N-Acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), D-Fucose and D-Mannose (Figure 3). We first verified with a dot blot assay that capsids interaction with monosaccharides were not interfering with antibody recognition, which validated the competition bioassay (Supplementary Materials Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3, JcDV binding resulted in an intense fluorescence signal on the PMs (left panel), which was similarly competed away by the four monosacharides and within a similar concentration range (0.5 mM to 5 mM).

Results showed that oral infection with 5 mM (but not 5 \u03bcM) of each monosaccharide significantly delayed the median time to death (LT50) of caterpillars (7 vs. 6 days; p < 0.05 for 5 mM) (Figure 4A and Supplementary Materials Figure S3A,B), further supporting that PM recognition is the first step of JcDV oral infection. To confirm these results and reveal JcDV binding and competition for binding the PM in vivo, we carried out midgut semi-thin sections and immunofluorescence as above. Caterpillars were infected with JcDV mixed or not with 5 mM GlcNAc and sacrificed at 2 h p.i. for midgut isolation and preparation. As shown in Figure 4B, we observed a red fluorescence signal in untreated infected caterpillars that typically lines the PM. In addition, labelling was also observed in the lumen, likely revealing JcDV interaction with food bolus and/or microbial components. Both signals were strongly and specifically decreased following competition with GlcNAc (Figure 4B), showing that different GlcNAc-containing glycans in the gut lumen can recognize the capsids.",

Total proteins were extracted from isolated PMs, separated with SDS-PAGE and either stained with PAGE Blue and Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) in order to visualize total and glycosylated proteins respectively, or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for VOPBA. We included porcine mucins as a control of highly (O-)glycosylated proteins. At the first glance, VOPBA revealed that JcDV binds to most if not all the PM proteins labelled by PAGE blue and PAS combined, although with different intensities (Figure 5B). Interestingly, no binding was observed with the porcine mucins which might support some specificity for insect glycans. More specifically, a set of JcDV-interacting proteins was identified at high molecular weights (>250 kDa) including proteins with a pattern similar to porcine mucins. These proteins were labelled with PAGE blue and PAS or only with PAS suggesting that they are mostly and probably highly glycosylated (Figure 5B). Interestingly, proteins at 180 kDa displayed a higher intensity as they are in a relative lower amount (according to PAGE blue), which suggests higher affinity for JcDV. Proteins interacting with JcDV were detected at 150\u2013200 kDa and 25\u201360 kDa, and corresponding to proteins with low or no glycosylation (according to PAS staining).",

We hypothesized that capsids aggregation on the matrix can result in its disorganization, in a way similar to chitin-binding wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin or Calcofluor [53]. To test this hypothesis, we used fluorescent WGA-labelling (WGA-FITC) to label chitin and thus examine chitin fibrils formation and PM organization. Third-instar caterpillars were fed with JcDV and then sacrificed at 1 day p.i. to dissect and prepare midguts for semi-thin sections and WGA labelling. As shown in Figure 7, the labelling of the PM (green) lined the apical surface of the epithelium in non-infected larvae (PBS condition, Figure 7, upper panel). In addition, we observed a specific labelling at the apex of columnar cells, probably corresponding to microvillar secretion of GlcNAc from these cells. By contrast, the labelling lining the epithelium appeared discontinuous following infection (Figure 7, lower panel), displaying a disorganized pattern reminiscent of the PM structure observed for caterpillars fed with the WGA lectin [53]. Moreover, intracellular labelling was no longer observed in the sections from infected caterpillars suggesting an arrest of GlcNAc secretion from the cells following early infection, i.e., before we can detect virus replication in subepithelial tissues [13]. These results thus support the hypothesis that JcDV binding on the PM and transcytosis is associated with a loss in its integrity, which might reveal gut dysfunction.",

We used Digital Gene Expression (DGE) based on the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression approach [35]. This method involves the sequencing and quantification of end tagged short cDNA fragments (i.e., Tags), which enables quantitative differential gene-expression analysis. We built four cDNA libraries from midguts of mock-and infected larvae (Supplementary Materials Tables S2 and S3). Tag sequences were mapped to the genome and transcriptome of S. frugiperda ([33,38]) and to the JcDV genome. None of the tags were assigned to viral transcripts, which is consistent with JcDV pathogenesis excluding replication in midgut cells [13]. Pie charts represented GO assignment corresponding to unique transcripts at 1 and 3 days p.i. that displayed a differential expression at least 5-fold up- or down-regulated (Supplementary Materials Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, the distribution of GO terms was roughly similar at 1 and 3 days p.i., suggesting that the overall intestinal response to JcDV oral infection was poorly affected by virus replication going on in subepithelial tissues (Supplementary Materials Figure S4A,B). We observed only GO terms enrichment for the over-represented transcripts at 1-day p.i., more specifically in functions involved in metabolic processes including translation (i.e., regulation of biological processes, response to stimuli and signaling) at 1 day p.i., that might indicate that JcDV intrusion induces a rapid metabolic response in the gut (Figure 8). Interestingly, these changes did not change significantly at 3 days p.i. suggesting that the gut response is rapidly initiated by JcDV transcytosis and was not affected by the viral replication that takes place in underlying tissues. We did not observe any significant activation of genes involved in \u201cinflammation\u201d nor in the canonical gut immune response. However, we observed an increased expression in cytochrome P450 and catalase genes that might indicate a response of the cells to the ongoing infection.",

Such \u201ccooperative\u201d mechanism of the capsids to overcome the PM is supported by the fact that PM disruption is enhanced by virus concentration and decreased as caterpillars age. Such developmental resistance of S. frugiperda has been also reported following baculovirus infections and a high synergism with Calcofluor was obtained at late instars (e.g., > 60-fold at 4th instar vs. 3 to 6-fold at 2nd and 3rd instars) [54].The structure and the composition of the PM can vary as caterpillars grow and feed, or between populations, which might impact virus-PM interactions and consequently insect susceptibility [16,17,55]. Whether PM disruption results from mechanical stresses on chitin fibers similar to calcofluor and probably WGA lectins or from an enzymatic activity of the capsids (i.e., of VP4) remains to be analyzed more thoroughly.

Interestingly, these changes are observed before we could detect JcDV transcription/replication in primary targeted cells [13], suggesting that these effects are induced as a consequence of the transport of the viral particles across the epithelium. It has been reported that specific drugs that disorganize microtubules induce an arrest of chitin synthesis [41,61]. We speculate that JcDV transcytosis might induce some stress on the cytoskeletal network, similar to microtubules disorganizing drugs. It is worthy to note that chitin synthesis arrest was not associated with a drop in the expression of chitin synthase genes. However, we cannot exclude to have missed enzymes due to some lack in the annotation of the genome of S. frugiperda [33].",

The competition of the capsid with monosaccharides for binding the PM, suggests that food components could interfere with infection. Indeed, plants contain compounds that can interfere with PM synthesis, which has been shown to consequently affect baculovirus infection [55] (Chen et al., 2018). Regarding bacteria, it has been shown recently that the PM controls commensal bacteria, and conversely that its synthesis and integrity can be microbiota-dependent, i.e., the gut microbiota inducing the expression of components of the peritrophic matrix [62,63]. So, it is plausible that food and microbiota can modify the outcome of the densovirus infection, either by directly competing for binding the PM, or indirectly by modulating the composition of the PM.",

Groundbreaking articles have shown the role of microbiota polysaccharides including GlcNAc, on the infectivity and thermostability of picornaviruses [64,65,66], whose capsid share structural similarity with parvoviruses [25]. It is tempting to speculate that densovirus \u201cstickiness\u201d can similarly impact their transmission, which might participate to their success if only among arthropods that occupy extremely diversified ecosystems [67]. Such consideration could also apply to parvoviruses going through faecal\u2013oral route and environmental contamination [58,68]. More generally, stickiness is a major issue for most viruses to and mathematical models have been applied to influenza. They predict that a maximum stickiness favors a maximum fitness [69].
