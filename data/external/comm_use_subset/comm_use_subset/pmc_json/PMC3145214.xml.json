Recent studies indicate that hand\n                sanitizers reduce overall infection-related absenteeism among elementary school\n                students by 20\u201350% [17,18,24\u201326], respiratory illnesses by 30\u201350% [17,24,26], and teacher absenteeism by 10% [25]. Use of hand sanitizer\n                in the home has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in children and\n                respiratory illnesses among family members [16,27]. Despite these findings, a review by\n                Meadows and Le Saux [28]\n                did not find sufficient evidence to specifically recommend hand sanitizer use in\n                general or among children with asthma; however, a review by Jefferson et\n                    al.
