The initiation of IFN expression is triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [2]. After viral RNAs are sensed by PRRs, signals are transmitted to different downstream adaptor molecules (such as IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)); and then I\u03baB kinase- (IKK-) related kinases are recruited. Next, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and ATF-2/c-jun are activated by the kinase complexes and translocate to the nucleus and directly induce the expression of type I IFNs [3].",

            "text": "TGEV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Coronaviridae (CoV) family and the Nidovirales order. CoVs are positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells [4]. CoVs encode two types of cysteine proteases, Mpro, and papain-like proteases, PL1 and PL2, which contained nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and nsp3, respectively. PLpro is served mainly as in processing of the replicase pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides [5]. Other than their role in replicase polyprotein processing, PL2 domains possess an additional but related enzymatic activity, in HCoV-NL63 [6], MHV [7], SARS-CoV [8, 9], and MERS-CoV [10], through their deubiquitination (DUB) enzymes, which play a key role in antagonizing IFN induction. However, TGEV PL1 processes the nsp2/nsp3 site and is capable of hydrolyzing isopeptide bonds in both Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains [11]. Whether TGEV PL1 could antagonize the production of IFNs was unknown.",

Notably, the luciferase activities of all three transcription factors were significantly inhibited by TGEV PL1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d)). Furthermore, Flag-PL1 also significantly inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production in PK-15 cells at protein level (Figure 1(e)), which was further confirmed with the result that TGEV PL1 could block the production of interferon. To further establish whether TGEV PL1 affects IRF3 phosphorylation or migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus, HEK293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1 and/or IRF3-EGFP. Then the result was analyzed using Western blot and confocal microscopy. In Figure 1(f), the level of p-IRF3 was decreased significantly by TGEV PL1 compared with that of SeV-induced. Furthermore, IRF3-EGFP was located in the cytoplasm compared with mock-infected HEK293T cells but translocated to the nucleus when the cells were inoculated with SeV. In contrast, after being inoculated with SeV, it was found that IRF3-EGFP was translocated from cytoplasm to nuclear in mock infected HEK293T cell, which was not observed in cells transfected with TGEV PL1 (Figure 1(g)). Our results collectively suggested that TGEV PL1 suppressed IFN-\u03b2 transcription by interfering with NF-\u03baB-, IRF3-, and AP-1 signaling-mediated IFN expression.",

TGEV PL1 mutation at two of the catalytic sites (C32A and H183A) led to almost complete loss of IFN antagonistic activity, relative to wild-type TGEV PL1, but the D196A mutant showed a little inhibition for IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Figures 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e)). Based on the results, we conclude that the intact catalytic triad of TGEV PL1 is required to inhibit activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter driven by STING and TBK-1. Recent studies have revealed that STING acts as a scaffold protein for TBK-1 and IRF3 and links them to the MAVS complex in mitochondria upon viral infection [16]. Moreover, activation of STING is critical for stimulation of IRF-3 activity. Here, we observed that TGEV PL1 protein inhibits STING- and TBK-1- induced activation of IFN-\u03b2. Additional localization experiments showed that PL1 existed in mitochondria (Figure 3(f)).",

The level of Ub-conjugated proteins was reduced dramatically in cells transfected with wild-type TGEV PL1, while the ubiquitinated Ub-HA level was not reduced in the presence of the C32A, H183A, and D196A mutants (Figure 4(a)). Next, we investigated whether TGEV PL1 recognizes and deubiquitinates the key regulators, RIG-I and STING, in the IFN signaling pathway. HEK293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1, together with Flag-RIG-1 and Flag-STING for 24 h, and cell lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot to determine the ubiquitination of the immunoprecipitated protein. TGEV PL1 was detected in association with RIG-1 as well as STING (Figures 4(b) and 4(c), lane 3). Moreover, a dramatic reduction in the amount of ubiquitinated RIG-1 (Figure 4(d)) and STING (Figure 4(e)) was detected. These results suggest that TGEV PL1 antagonizes the IFN signaling pathway via deubiquitination of RIG-1 and STING.",

PL2 of MHV strongly inhibits CARDIF-, TBK1-, and IRF3-mediated IFN-\u03b2 reporter activities and prevented nuclear translocation of IRF3 [7]. PEDV PLP2 negatively regulated RIG-I and STING-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression [14].

In the present study, we first found that overexpressed TGEV PL1 inhibited STING- and TBK-1-mediated IFN-\u03b2 transcription and antagonized the type I IFN response stimulated by SeV in PK-15 cells. The catalytic activity of TGEV PL1 is essential for inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 transcription. Furthermore, STING dimerization is reduced in the presence of HCoV-NL63 PL2-TM, which was not affected by TGEV PL1.

Recently, DUBs have been reported in a variety of viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, Lpro [23], human cytomegalovirus, UL48 [24], herpes simplex virus type 1, UL36 [25], and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, nsp2 [26, 27]. Interestingly, all CoVs have evolved to encode DUB enzymes, which may contribute to modulation of the innate immune response. PLP of HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MHV, PEDV, and MERS-CoV dramatically reduced the levels of ubiquitinated STING, RIG-I, TBK1, and IRF-3 to negatively regulate host antiviral innate immunity. Here, we showed that TGEV PL1 interferes with and significantly inhibits ubiquitination of RIG-1 and STING, which are essential activators of type I IFN signaling. Then, the levels of phosphorylated IRF-3 were reduced, which blocked nuclear translocation of IRF3 to activate the transcript of IFNs. Three catalytically inactive mutants of TGEV PL1 (C32A, H183A, and D196A) found to be defective in DUB activity failed to inhibit virus-induced INF-\u03b2 expression, indicating that the DUB function of TGEV PL1 is directly involved in inhibition of type I IFN induction. However, the membrane protein M and envelope protein E of TGEV were translated at the late step of the replication as the major inducing component of IFNs. Further studies are required to establish the precise functions of PL1 protease/DUB activity in coronavirus interactions with the host innate immune response.",

We found that TGEV PL1 displayed IFN antagonist activity dependent on the intact catalytic triad (C32, H183, and D196) and interfered with RIG-1- and STING-mediated signaling through a viral DUB activity. These characteristics of TGEV PL1 served as a multifunctional protein with a critical regulatory role in TGEV interactions with the host antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, these findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity evasion strategies utilized by TGEV.",
