The genomic RNA associates with the nucleoprotein (N), forming helical nucleocapsids that are enclosed within lipid envelopes containing the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, and small envelope (E) protein. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is a highly glycosylated type I membrane glycoprotein that is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of about 180 kDa that oligomerizes into homotrimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and that is processed in the Golgi apparatus of the host cell (16\u201318) and is observable as 20-nm structures projecting from the virion surface by electron microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the S protein forms a clove-shaped trimer of S1 subunits linked to a stalk of trimeric S2 subunits (19\u201321). The S protein is responsible for binding to the target cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, fulfilling a major role in the infection of susceptible cells (22).",

            "text": "Coronavirus S glycoproteins consist of four domains: an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved during synthesis; the ectodomain, which is present on the outside of the virus particle; the transmembrane region, which is responsible for anchoring the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virus particle; and the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus. The S glycoproteins of some coronaviruses, including IBV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), are cleaved during biosynthesis into two subunits, S1 and S2, by a furin-like protease in the Golgi apparatus, which remain noncovalently linked (23). The IBV S glycoprotein (1,162 amino acids) is composed of two subunits, S1 (535 amino acids, 90 kDa), comprising the N-terminal half of the S protein, and S2 (627 amino acids, 84 kDa), comprising the C-terminal half of the S protein. As with other coronaviruses, the S2 subunit contains the transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domains and the S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (24\u201327). Proteolytic activation and binding of the S1 subunit to the host cell receptor induce conformational changes in the spike (28, 29) (30), leading to virus-cell fusion and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (31). The ectodomain region of the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide (32\u201339) and two heptad repeat regions involved in oligomerization of the S protein (40) and is required for entry into susceptible cells (41\u201343). The spike interacts with the M protein on pre-Golgi membranes, forming multimeric complexes (44), and is incorporated into forming virions (45).",

            "text": "The coronavirus RBD is an independently folded region of the S glycoprotein responsible for interacting with the virus receptor on susceptible host cells. Although all coronavirus RBDs are found within the S1 subunit, they are virus specific and vary in position throughout the S1 domain (46\u201348). The location of the RBD of IBV has been mapped to be within the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the S1 subunit (49). The host cell receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified; several of the Alphacoronaviruses, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), type II feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), use aminopeptidase N as the host cell receptor (50\u201352). In contrast, Betacoronaviruses have been found to utilize a variety of different receptors. The principal receptor for MHV is murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) (53); the virus also attaches to O-acetylated sialic acid, which is mediated by an extra structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein found in the virus membrane of some coronaviruses in this genus, rather than the S glycoprotein (54). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor (55) along with CD209L (56) and is also thought to use the C-type lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and L-SIGN as alternative receptors independently of ACE2 (57). The receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified to be dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also known as CD26 (58). The protein receptor for IBV has not yet been elucidated, although two strains of IBV, M41 and Beaudette, have been shown to use \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid as an attachment factor (59, 60) and for subsequent infection of the tracheal epithelium (61, 62). The interaction between IBV and sialic acid has been confirmed by Madu et al. (63), who also identified a heparan sulfate (HS) binding site between amino acid residues 686 and 691 of the S2 subunit of the Beaudette S glycoprotein and showed that HS may be involved as a cofactor in Beaudette virus entry into host cells. Yamada and Liu (64) identified an additional furin cleavage motif within the putative HS binding site identified by Madu et al. (63) with a role in viral entry and syncytium formation in vitro. Cleavage was mapped to arginine residue 690. The susceptibility of cultured cells to infection with Beaudette was subsequently found to correlate with cellular furin expression levels (65). This additional proteolytic cleavage site within the S2 subunit, named S2\u2032, has since been identified in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-229E and found to mediate membrane fusion and viral infectivity (66\u201369).",

However, some strains of IBV, following adaptation, are able to replicate in primary chicken cells, such as chick kidney (CK) cells. Interestingly, the Beaudette strain, after several hundred passages in embryonated eggs, was also discovered to have an extended host range with the ability to replicate in a mammalian cell line, Vero cells (72), and to a limited extent in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell lines (73). We have previously demonstrated that the cellular tropism of IBV is determined by the S glycoprotein; replacement of the ectodomain of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein with the corresponding region from the pathogenic IBV M41-CK resulted in a recombinant IBV (rIBV), BeauR-M41(S), which had the tissue tropism associated with M41-CK (74). The present study aims to elucidate the specific regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism, thus enabling the rational design and generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.",

M41-CK, BeauR-M41(S), and BeauR-M41(S2) P3-CK did not reach titers greater than 1.5 log10 PFU/ml in Vero cells. Our results show that BeauR-M41(S1) P3-CK and Beau-R produce infectious progeny in both CK and Vero cells, whereas the tropism of BeauR-M41(S2) P3-CK resembled that of M41-CK and BeauR-M41(S) for growth in Vero cells. Overall, replacement of the Beaudette S1 subunit with the corresponding S1 sequence from M41-CK did not affect the ability of the rIBV to replicate and produce progeny virus in Vero cells. In contrast, replacement of the Beaudette S2 subunit with the M41 S2 sequence resulted in loss of the ability of Beau-R to grow in Vero cells.

CK cells were infected with BeauR-M41-S-BSM P3-CK, BeauR-S-MM P3-CK, or parent virus Beau-R, BeauR-M41(S), or M41-CK for 24 h and then lysed, and the proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S2 antibody (Fig. 8). A clear S2\u2032 cleavage product was observed in the Beau-R sample, but this was absent in the BeauR-M41(S), M41-CK, and BeauR-S-MM samples, which do not contain the BSM and are unable to grow in Vero cells. A faint band corresponding to the S2\u2032 cleavage product was also observed in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM sample, indicating that proteolytic cleavage at the S2\u2032 site within the BSM may play a role in extending the host tropism of Beau-R. The faint band generated by BeauR-M41-S-BSM in comparison with that produced by Beau-R may indicate that proteolytic processing is not as efficient in the recombinant spike glycoprotein. This could be due to subtle differences in the tertiary or quaternary structures of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM spike glycoprotein resulting in steric hindrance of the protease acting at the S2\u2032 site. The size of the S2\u2032 cleavage product is smaller than expected when analyzed by Western blotting. It is possible that the band that we observed at about 30 kDa may be a breakdown product of the S2\u2032 cleavage product or that the size of the S2\u2032 cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this band was observed only in samples infected with rIBV containing the Beaudette-specific motif surrounding the S2\u2032 cleavage site, indicating that this is where cleavage occurs, so its production may be involved in the extended tropism of Beau-R.",

Production of IBV vaccines in embryonated eggs is expensive and cumbersome, with each egg producing only a small volume of allantoic fluid from which the virus is isolated. Furthermore, the supply of embryonated eggs is not guaranteed to be reliable, which may seriously affect the production of required vaccines. As the demand for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines rises, the supply of embryonated eggs for the production of other vaccines may be reduced. Another concern about the use of embryonated eggs is the possible presence of adventitious viruses, which may compromise the vaccine stocks or cause pathology in the vaccinated chickens.",

This indicates that the chimeric spikes are still able to undergo the conformational changes required during entry into host cells. It is possible that inefficient conformational changes leading to a reduction in the rate of viral entry into host cells may be responsible for the lag in viral growth kinetics for some of the rIBVs with modified spike glycoproteins at early times in the course of infection.

Although there is a clear indication of the involvement of the Beaudette-specific motif in the ability of Beau-R to replicate on Vero cells, the addition of other Beaudette-specific amino acids within the S2 subunit or mutations introduced by serial passage in Vero cells were able to further increase the growth kinetics of the rIBVs on Vero cells. These additional mutations may serve to optimize the structure of the recombinant S glycoprotein.

It is possible that both activities may play a role in the extended tropism of Beaudette in vitro. The results of this study suggest that IBV Beaudette employs a mechanism of entry into Vero cells different from that into CK cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that rIBVs containing the Beaudette-specific motif are susceptible to cleavage at the S2\u2032 site, whereas the rIBVs containing the equivalent sequence from M41 are not cleaved at the S2\u2032 site. The efficiency of this cleavage appears to be lower in the rIBVs containing the BSM than in Beau-R, however, which may be due to differences in the tertiary or quaternary structure between the spike glycoproteins, resulting in the S2\u2032 site being less accessible to the protease. The S2\u2032 cleavage product of 472 amino acids equates to about 52 kDa if you assume a linear relationship between molecular weight and the size of the protein. The S2 is glycosylated and palmitoylated, which alters the size and which can distort the protein coils that form when the protein is denatured using SDS. We consistently see a band of about 30 kDa in Beau-R-infected samples. It is possible that this band may be a breakdown product of the S2\u2032 cleavage product or that the size of the S2\u2032 cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. Nonetheless, this study contributes to the mounting evidence from other coronaviruses that cleavage at the S2\u2032 site is involved in entry and that this region plays a role in fusion activation (64, 66, 67, 69).",

This rIBV based on the genome of Beaudette, but with the S glycoprotein ectodomain from M41-CK, has the same tropism as M41-CK and is therefore able to produce infectious virus on CK cells but not Vero cells. IBV strains were propagated and titrated in CK cells as described previously (89\u201391). Growth curves and confocal microscopy of IBV infection were carried out using CK and Vero cells (74). Vaccinia viruses (VVs) were propagated in Vero cells, and large stocks for DNA extraction were prepared in BHK-21 cells as described previously (76, 77).",

Comparison of their nucleotide and amino acid sequences show many differences between the two viruses. Unfortunately, there are instances in the literature where it is implied that Beaudette was derived from M41 (63, 92), leading to the incorrect conclusion that mutations arising in M41 may have led to the ability of Beaudette to produce infectious progeny in Vero cells. This may have arisen from IBV Beaudette being referred to as IBV-42 (sometimes abbreviated to M42) and M41 as IBV-41 (72, 93, 94). IBV Beaudette was isolated in the 1930s (87), and M41 was isolated in the 1940s (84). IBV Beaudette is able to grow and produce infectious virus in CK cells and can be also be adapted to Vero cells by repeat passage, as observed by syncytium formation (72). Beau-R, the molecular clone of Beaudette CK, does not produce syncytia when grown on Vero cells (75); however, repeated passage of Beau-R on Vero cells resulted in adaption, as previously observed for Beaudette CK, for syncytium formation on Vero cells (95).",

Overlapping PCR was used to combine the subunits, forming the chimeric S genes, which were then inserted into NsiI- and BspEI-digested pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI to create the plasmids pGPT-BeauR-S1-M41-S2 and pGPT-M41-S1-BeauR-S2. The IBV replicase gene and gene 3 sequences, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the S gene sequences, respectively, were derived from Beau-R. Sequences corresponding to 715-bp cDNAs of the Beaudette and M41 S2 regions were synthesized and cloned into pGPT-NEB193 (76) by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific). pGPT-BeauR-S-MM was based on the Beau-R S glycoprotein, in which the Beaudette-specific motif (BSM) 686SRRKRSLIE694, located within the S2 subunit, was replaced with the corresponding sequence, the M41 motif (MM) 686SPRRRSFIE694 from M41-CK. pGPT-M41-S-BSM contained a cDNA based on the M41-CK S glycoprotein, in which the MM sequence 686SPRRRSFIE694 was replaced with the BSM 686SRRKRSLIE694 motif.
