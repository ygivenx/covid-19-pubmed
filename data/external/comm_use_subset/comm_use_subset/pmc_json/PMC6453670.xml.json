Apicomplexan CDPKs, belonging to a superfamily of serine-threonine kinases, are among the most abundant classes of calcium sensors and are crucial for multiple physiological functions such as gliding, cell invasion, egress and replication (Kugelstadt et al., 2011; Ojo et al., 2012). Most importantly, these CDPKs are absent in mammalian hosts, rendering them excellent parasite-specific drug targets (Billker et al., 2009; Larson et al., 2012; Ojo et al., 2010). CDPKs in apicomplexan parasites can be effectively targeted by bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs), a class of synthetic competitive inhibitors of ATP-binding. BKI selectivity is based on a small \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 residue present in apicomplexan CDPK1 (Keyloun et al., 2014). This allows for BKIs with large aromatic moieties displayed from the C-3 position of the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold to selectively target the apicomplexan enzyme and not mammalian or other parasite kinases.",

The disease is usually non-fatal but of high morbidity in affected litters (Lindsay et al., 1985; Roepstorff et al., 1998; Sayd and Kawazoe, 1998). Cystoisosporosis is characterized by watery-to-pasty non-hemorrhagic diarrhea, impaired weight gain and reduced and uneven weaning weights in piglets, and consequently imposes significant economic losses on the pig farming industry (Mundt et al., 2005, 2007; Shrestha et al., 2015). The triazinone toltrazuril is the only commercially marketed compound available for effective treatment of cystoisosporosis. Due to the enforcement of strict regulations on the use of anticoccidials in many countries and, most importantly, the emergence of resistance against toltrazuril in C. suis (Shrestha et al., 2017), the search for alternative effective therapeutic and control strategies against cystoisosporosis is a priority.",

In the present study, BKI 1369 successfully ameliorated cystoisosporosis in its natural host, the pig, employing experimental infections with two different strains of C. suis with varying susceptibility to toltrazuril. The in vivo results were further supported by in vitro demonstration of efficacy against C. suis merozoites in IPEC-1 cell cultures and genetic and functional studies on the putative target enzyme, CsCDPK1. Repeated oral applications of BKI 1369 showed marked systemic exposure after treatment, significantly reduced oocyst excretion and diarrhea, and improved body weight gains in treated piglets. The results of the animal experimental and in vitro studies thus validate BKI 1369 as a potential therapeutic candidate against porcine cystoisosporosis, and they also have possible implications for efficacy studies of BKI 1369 against cystosiospororsis in other mammalian hosts.",

Numerous infected epithelial cells with distinct clustered merozoites of C. suis were observed in stained jejunal sections of mock treated control piglets (Fig. 8D). Giemsa-stained mucosal scraping smears from mock treated piglets revealed the presence of matured crescent-shaped merozoites within the parasitophorous vacuole (Fig. 9). Neither histopathological alterations in the morphology of villi nor presence of endogenous stages of C. suis could be detected in tissue sections and mucosal scraping smears of BKI-treated piglets.",

Contrary to most mammalian kinases, the presence of glycine as a gatekeeper residue in the ATP-binding site of apicomplexan CDPK1 enables BKIs to fit perfectly into a small hydrophobic pocket, rendering them highly selective and promising compounds for therapeutic intervention against these parasites.",

Unlike all the previously studied apicomplexan recombinant CDPK enzymes, the peptide substrate syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK) was not compatible for measurement of CsCDPK1 kinase activity in vitro. This is inspite of the highly conserved amino acid sequence similarities between CsCDPK1 and other CDPK1 enzyme active sites. However, CsCDPK1 auto-phosphorylation activity could be measured in the presence or absence of calcium and with or without a suitable peptide substrate. Experimental analysis confirmed its calcium dependency as determined in phosphorylation reactions using EGTA as a Ca2+ chelator in the presence or absence of PLKtide (Signalchem Richmond, BC, Canada) peptide substrate (CKKLGEDQAEEISDDLLED-SLSDEDE). This calcium dependent regulation of enzyme activity is a verification that it belongs to the same family as previously described apicomplexan CDPKs (Van Voorhis et al., 2017). Future studies will be needed to determine the potential divergence of functions, natural substrates or pathways of CsCDPK1 relative to other CDPKs. Nonetheless, sensitivity to BKIs by a direct inhibition of enzyme activity was confirmed in direct enzyme activity assay and further demonstrated indirectly by a thermal stabilization assay.",

Additionally, the IC50 concentration of BKI 1369 measured against recombinant CsCDPK1 (4.5 nM) corroborated the efficacy of this compound in the in vitro dose-response assay (IC50 = 40 nM). Further validation of the relatedness of CsCDPK1 to TgCDPK1 was shown by improved EGTA thermal stabilization of the enzymes relative to the control where Ca2+ is presumably bound to the recombinant enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S2B) as previously reported (Scheele et al., 2018). This result seems counterintuitive since calcium activates the enzymes, yet chelating Ca2+ appears to maximize thermal stability (Scheele et al., 2018).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that lesions induced by intracellular replication of C. suis impair physiological and functional balance of the intestine and therefore have a negative impact on body weight development of piglets (Mundt et al., 2006). A similar effect of C. suis infection was observed in this study with significantly lower daily body weight gain and total weight gain in the control piglets compared to BKI 1369 treated piglets during the acute phase of infection. This effect tended to wane in the following period (after SD 15), which might be due to gradual healing of the intestinal epithelium and maturation of the immune system with increasing piglet age, a general feature in coccidiosis. Histological sections from mock treated control piglets revealed cuboidal villous epithelium, shortened villi and villous fusion together with numerous merogonic stages of C. suis within parasitophorus vacuoles. In comparison, morphological alterations in the gut were not observed in treated piglets, which underpins the hypothesis that C. suis-induced intestinal damage disturbs the physiological function of the intestine, ultimately leading to diarrhea, malabsorption of nutrients and reduced weight gain (Lindsay et al., 1985; Stuart et al., 1982).",

            "text": "BKI 1369 achieved therapeutic concentrations in piglet plasma in the micromolar range, far above the effective in vitro levels (IC95 = 200 nM). The plasma concentration already reached a peak 2 h after the 1st dose and the concentration gradually increased to 11.7 \u03bcM 2 h before the 9th dose, indicating accumulation of the drug in plasma after treatment twice daily for 5 days. Consequently, assuming similar levels are found in infected gut epithelium, the in vivo parasites were constantly exposed to very high concentrations of BKI 1369. This could be the reason for the complete cessation of parasite development and replication in vivo compared to in vitro experiments. These results are in accordance with previous studies on BKI 1369 in C. hominis infected piglets, which reported low concentrations of the metabolites during the dosing period. Further pharmacokinetics studies in piglets to determine the concentrations of BKI 1369 in gastrointestinal tissues over time would be warranted to better understand the relationship between efficacy and exposure at the infection sites. Also, since the plasma levels reached the observed concentrations of 11.7 \u03bcM during dosing, well above the 1 \u03bcM concentration that showed effects in vitro to IPEC-1 cell viability, multi-dose toxicity studies that include blood chemistry and histopathology would be warranted to fully assess any effects that BKI 1369 might have on the host species. In summary, the present study evaluated therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety parameters of BKI 1369 against porcine cystoisosporosis in an experimental infection of its natural host. Application of single drug concentration is one of the major limitations of this study, due to which it was not possible to determine minimal effective drug concentration and to develop practical drug application scheme. Oral applications of BKI 1369 were highly effective in reducing oocyst shedding and diarrhea, and improved body weight gain in piglets infected with C. suis, including the toltrazuril-resistant Holland-I isolate, without adverse effects. The successful outcome in both the in vitro culture and the animal infection model of porcine cystoisosporosis also strongly argues for developing BKI 1369 as a chemotherapeutic compound against this disease, both in pigs and in other mammals including humans (Shrestha et al., 2015). However, BKI 1369 therapy in the field might have practicability issues, owing to the need for multiple doses. Therefore, future studies on BKI 1369 should be concentrated towards ease of drug handling and reducing treatment frequencies.",
