            "text": "Heart failure is characterised as a decline in cardiac contractility, which is associated with structural changes, collectively termed cardiac remodelling. Cardiac myofibroblasts are key mediators of cardiac remodelling via their proliferation, invasion and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates cardiac myofibroblast transdifferentiation leading to fibrosis. Ang II also stimulates proliferation [1], NADPH oxidase activation [2] (and thereby reactive oxygen species production), the production of proinflammatory cytokines [3] and the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [4]. As a result, Ang II is a major contributor to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. Ang II is generated from the biologically inert peptide, Ang I, by the catalytic action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key proteolytic step in the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Aberrant functioning of the RAS is a feature of a variety of cardiovascular, renal and other pathologies and ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor 1 (AT1R) antagonists are widely used in the clinic. Accordingly, ACE inhibition has been shown to prevent cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI) and preserves cardiac function [5], [6]. A combination of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers has been shown to be more effective than either alone [7]. A decade ago a new member of this system was identified, termed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [8], [9]. ACE2 acts to hydrolyse Ang II into the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), thereby contributing to reductions in blood pressure. Current models of the RAS are based on the concept that the two enzymes counterbalance each other.",

Mortality was associated with enhanced adverse ventricular remodelling following MI [10], a state which was reversed by the use of an AT1R blocker and as such the pathology of ACE2 deletion was attributed to the increased levels of Ang II [10]. A mounting body of evidence is forming in support of a cardioprotective role for ACE2, through the metabolism of Ang II [10], [11], but also through the direct action of Ang-(1-7) via its own receptor, Mas [12]. Like Ang II the actions of Ang-(1-7) extend beyond vasopressor control, and for the most part appear to counteract the effects of Ang II and therefore mediate cardioprotection [13]. Ang-(1-7) reduces interstitial fibrosis [14], myocyte hypertrophy [15] and inhibits myocyte cell growth [16]. The reduction in myocyte hypertrophy resulting from expression of Ang-(1-7) was associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and also a reduction in exogenous ACE transcript [17].",

Recent studies of heart failure patients have linked elevated levels of soluble (shed) ACE2 (sACE2) to increased myocardial dysfunction and thus have indirectly identified a protective role for the cell surface-associated form [29]. Hence, the ectodomain of ACE2 may have a role in cardiac remodelling independent of its catalytic activity. Here we show that both angiotensin converting enzymes bind ITGB1 and integrin \u03b15 (ITGA5) in vitro. The data presented provide evidence that the enzymes provide a substrate for cellular adhesion and that the interaction between ACE2 and an integrin increases cellular adhesion when both are present on the cell membrane. We demonstrate that the ectodomain of ACE2 regulates integrin induced cell signalling via modulation of the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Akt expression levels.",

Huh7 cell adhesion to the substrate cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 4A). Calibrations confirmed that the relative fluorescence measured was proportional to the number of cells seeded (Figure 4B). A significant difference was seen between the adhesion of Huh7 cells to ACE2-expressing cells compared with non ACE2-expressing cells (Figure 4C); the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface increased cell adhesion by approximately 25%. To further examine any role of RGD-mediated cell adhesion, cells were incubated with an RGD peptide prior to plating. Pre-incubation with RGD peptide significantly reduced the adhesion of Huh7 to HEK control cells (Figure 4C); cellular expression of ACE2 abolished the decrease mediated by pre-incubation with an RGD peptide (Figure 4C). Conversely, cellular expression of ACE conferred no enhanced adhesion properties compared to control cells (Figure 4D).

An association between ITGB1 and ACE2 has previously been reported in the failing heart and attributed to the presence of an RGD motif in ACE2 [25]. We have established that both ACE and ACE2 binds ITGB1 and also its common cardiac binding partner, ITGA5 [37], as well as the RGD-independent and liver rich ITGA2 [38]. However, in contrast to the study of Lin et al. [25] our data clearly suggest that these interactions occur independently of an RGD motif. 3-dimensional modelling has demonstrated that the RGD motif present in the ectodomain of ACE2 is inaccessible, which explains its redundancy in integrin binding. The aspartate residue is positioned facing the active site cleft of the protein and as such is not available to bind into the integrin binding pocket [39]. Given the structural homology between the two proteins, it is not surprising that ACE is also capable of binding integrins as the interaction appears to be independent of the RGD sequence, which is lacking in ACE.",

The ability of prothrombin to bind integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is key to its biological activity in the fibrotic cascade [40]. As in ACE2, the carboxylate group of the Asp of the RGD motif is directed towards the specificity pocket of the enzyme [41]. In its native state prothrombin does not exert strong adhesive properties. However, proteolytic maturation exposes the RGD motif and thereby enhances the adhesive properties of thrombin [42]. This mechanism is unlikely to occur in ACE2 which, when present on the cell membrane, is in its mature form (unlike thrombin it does not occur in an inactive proenzyme form during biosynthesis). What is more, any rearrangement of the active site of ACE2 is likely to inhibit its catalytic activity; sACE2 is catalytically active.",

What is more, the presence of ACE2 on the cell surface partially removed the requirement of RGD-interactions for cellular adhesion. Fibroblast motility is a key process in the development of scar tissue and thus cellular adhesion is an important homeostatic mechanism. In order to study the role of ACE and ACE2 in the remodelling response, primary cardiac myofibroblasts were used as a disease model. These cells play a key role in the maintenance of cardiac architecture under conditions of injury, by forming scar tissue through their ability to proliferate and adhere [47]. We demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 exert comparable effects over myofibroblast adhesion, but that again this effect is not mediated through an RGD motif. Recent clinical investigations have highlighted that elevated levels of sACE2 in patient plasma correlated with increased myocardial dysfunction [29] and vascular compliactions in type 1 diabetes [48]. We have shown that both ACE and ACE2 interact with the cell surface in adhesion assays and, furthermore, ACE2, in particular, enhances cell adhesion and may modulate integrin signalling. Cellular retention of ACE2 is therefore required for its role as a cellular anchor and, as such, the cleavage of ACE2 by ADAM17 [49] may be a pathological step in the development of heart failure. The retention of ACE2 on the cell membrane is known to be regulated by cell signalling [24] and viral infection [50]. Shed ACE2 could activate integrins by binding to them and transducing activating signals or, additionally, by interacting with non-integrin sites given the multiple protein-protein interactions with which the ACE2 protein is involved.",

We demonstrate that sACE2, at levels comparable to those reported in human plasma, significantly reduces FAK phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, we show that treatment with sACE2 increases the levels of Akt expression, a pro-survival, pro-proliferative protein. Changes in the level of phosphorylated Akt were also seen in response to sACE2; however, these were accounted for by the increase in the amount of total Akt. As such, signalling by Akt was not transmitted to its downstream effector NF-\u03baB. sACE2 has no known function. We do not dismiss the possibility that this circulating ACE2 may bind integrins, when released from the plasma membrane, and elicit autocrine or paracrine signalling. In fact, one of the shed forms of the amyloid precursor protein, sAPP\u03b1, binds to ITGB1 and signals to enhance axon outgrowth [52]. What is more, cellular expression of full length APP inhibits axonal outgrowth and an excess of the shed form overcomes this inhibition [52]. We therefore propose some of the anti-proliferative actions of ACE2 may in part be mediated through a non-catalytic interaction with integrins, rather than by metabolism of Ang II per se. These data suggest that ACE2, through its integrin binding abilities, may have regulatory roles in cellular attachment and support a novel mechanism of integrin activation upon ACE2 shedding.",
