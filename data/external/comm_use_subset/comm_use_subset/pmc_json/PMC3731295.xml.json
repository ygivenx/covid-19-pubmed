            "text": "Since February, 2013, a previously unrecognized novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus associated with human deaths has emerged in China [1]. Although the transmission of avian influenza virus subtypes H5, H7, and H9 to human has been reported early [2], it is the first time that N9 subtype influenza virus has infected human beings. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that all the genes of the novel H7N9 viruses are of avian origin, and are recombined from at least three influenza virus lineages [1], [3]. Compared with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, it seems to be easier for the novel H7N9 virus to transmit from animals to human. As of 2 May 2013, there have been 128 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H7N9 virus including 26 fatalities [4]. Although different strains of the novel H7N9 virus have been isolated from poultries, birds and the environmental specimens (Data from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, GISAID), the source of infection in most of the human cases still remains to be determined. So far, there has been no direct evidence of human-to-human transmission of this virus, however, the presence of mutations in the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) gene associated with improved replication of avian influenza viruses in mammals might indicate a certain propensity of the H7N9 virus to further adapt to humans [1], [3]. Therefore, the potential for the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus to spread among the human population is still exist.",

Methods based on PCR are more rapid and sensitive than traditional techniques including virus isolation and serological assays. Real-time RT-PCR is at present the powerful molecular diagnostic method for the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus infection [5], [6], however, it requires expensive real-time PCR equipment and highly skilled technicians, which make this method not suitable for use in primary clinical settings or for field use. The Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method allows amplification of DNA with high specificity and sensitivity at a constant temperature of 60\u201365\u00b0C [7]. As the reaction is conducted under isothermal conditions, it can be carried out with a simple water bath so that a thermal cycler is not required. LAMP can also be used to detect RNA template by the use of reverse transcriptase together with DNA polymerase [7], [8]. To date, RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect various RNA viruses [9]\u2013[12].",

As a result, non-specific amplification products may cause false positive results. To help overcome this problem, LAMP products can be identified by restriction endonuclease digestion [7] or by hybridization with specific probes [16]. To further simplify and speed up the process of the LAMP assay, amplicon detection by lateral flow device (LFD) was successfully applied [17]. In this study, a RT-LAMP amplification combined with a LFD (RT-LAMP-LFD) assay was developed for the rapid detection of novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus. The characteristics of simplicity (without the need for complex or expensive equipment), rapidity (results can be obtained within 1h), and excellent sensitivity and specificity make this RT-LAMP-LFD method more suitable for use in low-equipment setting laboratory.",

The RT-LAMP products were also detected by a LFD (Ustar Biotech Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China) as described previously [17]. The principle is primers LF and LB are conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin, respectively, during a positive RT-LAMP reaction both tags are incorporated in the amplicons resulting in a visible test line. The LFD detection also utilizes a control line to indicate whether the unit has functioned correctly.",

However, due to the use of several primers, RT-LAMP generates a complex mixture of DNA products, and thus these product detection methods cannot distinguish specific and non-specific amplicons. Furthermore, assessment of turbidity or color with the unaided eye is potentially subjective, and there is always the possibility that a sample may be somewhat ambiguous to the naked eye when the concentration of virus is low [23]. Additionally, some dyes such as SYBR green I have adverse effect on LAMP amplification reaction. Gel electrophoresis has been found to be approximately 10\u00d7more sensitive than the SYBR green/naked eye inspection [24], nevertheless, electrophoresis after amplification increases the opportunity for product contamination. In the present study, we used a simple LFD utilizing a lateral flow strip housed in an enclosed, sealed plastic device to prevent the leakage of amplicons to objectively detect RT-LAMP products in approximately 5 min [17], [25], [26]. The use of LFD to detect RT-LAMP products not only makes the assay more specific, but also negates the need for electrophoresis equipment and DNA detection equipment. Our results showed that the LFD method was as sensitive as real-time turbidity detection. In some studies, only one labeled primer was used in LAMP reaction, another labeled probe was added into the LAMP amplicons to form double-labeled detectable products [27]\u2013[29]. This would increase the chance of product contamination. In our study, both loop primers were labeled with tags such as FITC and biotin. The results obtained from this study and others [24], [30], [31] demonstrated that the usage of two labeled primers has no adverse effect on LAMP reaction.",
