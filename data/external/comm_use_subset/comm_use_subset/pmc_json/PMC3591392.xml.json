Grouping pre-diagnostic data into syndromes is the first step of implementing a syndromic surveillance system [3]. Valid, reliable, and automatic classification of syndromes was an essential component of early computerized epidemic detection systems [6]. When data are structured using standardised codes, such as the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae) used in laboratories, the International Classification of Diseases (now on its 10th revision, ICD-10), or the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED\u00ae) [7], syndrome classification can be performed by mapping those codes into syndromes. However, text mining or other machine learning tools can be invaluable when free-text or semi-structured data are being used [6]. Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers have frequently been used in syndromic surveillance when the input data are chief complaints (free-text typed in by nurses) at emergency facilities [6], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

Laboratory submission data have, for example, been incorporated into CDC\u2019s BioSense Early Event Detection and Situation Awareness System [19]. Moreover, because there are fewer laboratories than sites of clinical care, the use of laboratory databases can provide more complete records and over larger areas [2]. Besides changing focus to early diagnosis, modern surveillance systems are evolving to complete biosurveillance systems. This term is intended to imply a broadening focus, addressing not only human health but all conditions that may threaten public health, such as a disruption in the food supply, or large social and economic disruptions resulting from outbreaks of diseases in animals [2], [20]. Besides their role in the food supply and agricultural economy, animals could serve as sentinels for the detection of certain zoonotic diseases that may be recognized earlier in animals than in humans [21].",

This review indicated that initiatives using laboratory data had been based on establishing direct relationships between test codes and syndromic groups. The use of clinical data has typically relied on syndrome definition being provided by the veterinarian. Machine learning or rule-based methods applied to the identification of syndromes in animal health data had not been documented. This paper describes the exploratory analysis of such methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. These steps are part of the development of a syndromic surveillance system taking advantage of the centralized, computerized, and routinely updated sources of data provided by the Animal Health Laboratory in the province of Ontario, Canada. The initial phase of implementation, described here, focused on cattle sample submissions.",

For the remainder of the data, high accuracy (F1-macro = 0.997) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier. Induced rules were manually modified during the construction phase, but resulted in clear interpretability of decisions and resulting classification. While the use of rules was easy to implement and interpret, the construction of a dictionary of medically relevant terms and the manipulation of rules were time-consuming steps. Implementation of similar systems making use of other sources of laboratory data should be easier facilitated as standardized languages are more widely adopted in animal health laboratories, avoiding the repetition of this process for every new database.",
