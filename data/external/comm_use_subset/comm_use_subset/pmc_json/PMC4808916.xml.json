The traditional deterministic compartmental models usually assume homogeneous mixing, which means that each individual has the same probability of contact with all of the others in the population [4]. However, there is a growing awareness that this assumption is not the case in reality, because heterogeneity can arise due to many sources [5], including age, sex, susceptibility to disease, position in space and the activities and behaviors of individuals, among others [6]. Here, we will focus on the heterogeneity in host contact rates at the population level.",

First, traditional compartmental models were extended: the infection term of the homogeneous mixing compartmental models was modified [7,8,9]. The compartments were further divided into multiple subgroups with similar behavioral characteristics (e.g., risk [10]) or demography (e.g., age [11,12]). Second, along with the rapid development in research on complex networks, a large body of literature has examined the effects of the heterogeneous contact structure on disease spread in networks [13,14]. The third type of modeling approach considering heterogeneity is agent-based modeling [15,16,17], which characterizes the heterogeneity in individual attributes and behaviors. Additionally, several researchers have attempted to bridge the gap between traditional compartmental models and individual-based models [18,19,20].",

First, by combining a Poisson distribution and a Gamma distribution, we derived a negative binomial distribution (NBD) transmission function, with which we developed a compartmental model. Then, we explored the influence of different levels of heterogeneity on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases using numerical simulations. Finally, we calibrated the model with the number of daily cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003, and the estimated parameters show that the control measures taken at that time were effective.",

            "text": "The heterogeneity in transmission can be modeled by assuming that the number of contacts among individuals varies from person to person. Let Xi represent the number of effective contacts (the number of contacts that would be sufficient for transmitting the disease successfully, were it to occur between a susceptible individual and an infectious individual [21,22]) with infectious individuals of the i-th susceptible person per unit time. Assume that Xi has a Poisson distribution \u03c0(\u03b8i), where \u03b8i is the mean of the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. That \u03b8i are identical means that each individual has an equal chance of effective contact with infectious individuals and an equal chance of being infected, thereby resulting in a traditional homogeneous-mixing model. In reality, however, individuals typically come into contact with only a small, clustered, subpopulation [20]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that different individuals have different average effective numbers of contacts in a certain period of time; that is, \u03b8i is itself a random variable. The Gamma distribution is a good choice for describing \u03b8i for a variety of reasons: it is bounded on the left at zero (the numbers of contact must be non-negative), is positively skewed (it has non-zero probability of an extremely high number of contacts) and can represent a variety of distribution shapes [23]. It has been used to describe the expected number of secondary cases caused by a particular infected individual [24]. Therefore, we assume a Gamma distribution for \u03b8i, with shape parameter k, rate parameter m (or scale parameter 1m) and the following probability distribution function:\n(1)g(\u03b8)=mk\u0393(k)\u03b8k-1e-m\u03b8,\u03b8>0",

Then, they were used in insect-pathogen models [27]. In [28], the author used the transmission function, kln(1+\u03b2Ik), to model a possum-tuberculosis (TB) system. The influence of different transmission functions on a simulated pathogen spread was studied in [29].

The infection process is represented in Figure 1. Children are born susceptible to the disease and enter the compartment S. A susceptible individual in compartment S is infected after effective contact with an infectious individual in compartment I and then enters the exposed compartment E. After the latent period ends, the individual enters the compartment I and becomes capable of transmitting the infection. When the infectious period ends, the individual enters the recovered class R and will never be infected again [4,22]. In each compartment, individual death occurs at a constant rate, \u03bc, which is equal to the birth rate. Death induced by the disease is not considered here. Therefore, the total population size in the model, N, remains unchanged. The SEIR model and its extension have been used to model many infectious diseases, for example, measles [30,31,32], rubella [33,34], influenza [35,36] and SARS [37,38], among others.",

The greatest difference is that at the overall level, the heterogeneity slows the transmission speed and decreases the peak sizes, which means milder disease outbreaks, because in the scenario with a high level of heterogeneity, only a small proportion of susceptible individuals have chances of coming into contact with infectious individuals and becoming infected, which results in a slower increase of the infected population. Second, after the peak is attained, the infectious curves do not decline as rapidly as those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model and the NBD models (Equation (4)) with larger values of k (Figure 2A), and the disease persists over a long term in the population (Figure 2B). Compared to the homogeneous-mixing model or the NBD models with larger values of k, up to the peak time (almost the same), there are many more individuals who are still susceptible to the disease. A proportion of them come into contact with infectious individuals and become infected, and this process persists for a long period of time. Moreover, Figure 2B shows that the endemic sizes of the two scenarios are approximately equal, just as noted in the previous section. In addition, when k drops to a very small value, there will be no disease outbreak, because almost none of the susceptible individuals have any chance of coming into contact with infectious individuals and becoming infected. It is shown that the contact patterns exhibit more heterogeneity than that assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but they do not appear extremely heterogeneous [6].",

After the peak of the disease outbreak is achieved, the infectious curves decrease slowly and reach endemic equilibrium gradually (Figure 3B).

Prompted by the rapid expansion of the epidemic, on 17 April, the Beijing municipal government established a Joint SARS Leading Group and deployed 10 task forces to oversee crisis management [41,42]. On 20 April, a larger number of cases was reported, and the Chinese government canceled the May Day holiday in an effort to reduce the mass movement of people [43]. Multiple measures were taken to control the spread of the disease, including the provision of personal protective equipment and training for healthcare workers [41]; introduction of community-based prevention and control through case detection, isolation, quarantine and community mobilization [41]; closure of the sites of public entertainment and schools [42]; and stopping the entry of all visitors or screening them for fever upon entry to universities and other places [42]. Additionally, a general increase in SARS awareness played an important role in controlling the outbreak [42]. The multiple measures implemented in Beijing likely led to the rapid resolution of the SARS outbreak [42].",

We used two different values, k1 and k2, to characterize the different levels of heterogeneity in contact in the population before and after 20 April [38]. We assumed a fixed value for \u03b2 for simplicity (in reality, the value of \u03b2 decreased along with the control strategies [38]; we mainly discuss the influence of the other parameter, k). We chose the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) [46] as the goodness of fit between the model output and the daily case data, as well as the objective function of the calibration procedure. In order to compute the NRMSE, we solved the set of differential equations (Equation (4)) with unknown parameters \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 and k=k1 from 7 March to 20 April. The initial conditions were set as follows: S(0)=1.4564\u00d7107, which was the size of the permanent population in Beijing in 2003 [47]; t=0 corresponds to 7 March 2003; E(0)=0; I(0)=2, which was the number of daily cases on 7 March 2003; and R(0)=0. Then, the output of the model on 20 April was taken as the initial value to solve Equation (4) with parameters \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 and k=k2 from 20 April to 4 June. Finally, the two outputs were combined and used to calculate the goodness of fit to the SARS daily case data. The birth and death rate, \u03bc, was assumed to be 1/70\nyear-1. In total, there were five unknown parameters to be estimated: k1,k2,\u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03b3.",

To address heterogeneous-mixing within populations, the populations were further divided into multiple subgroups [10,11,12], and used the WAIFW matrix (\u201cwho acquires infection from whom\u201d [1]), in which any individual is more likely to come into contact with other individuals from within the same subgroup than those outside. However, in this framework, contact rates within the subgroups are still homogeneous. A different class of approaches for extending the traditional compartmental models to incorporate heterogeneity involves modifying the transmission term; our approach belongs to this class. The work in [7,8,19] replaced the bilinear transmission term (SI) in the homogeneous compartmental model with a nonlinear term kSpIq, where k,p,q are the \u201cheterogeneity parameters\u201d. Their results showed that the modified model was capable of predicting the disease transmission patterns in a clustered network [19]. Stroud et al. used a power-law scaling of the new infection rate I(S/N)v, with scaling power v greater than one, to relax the homogeneous-mixing assumption [9], and it was demonstrated that this power-law formulation leads to significantly lower predictions of the final epidemic size than the traditional linear formulation. Compared to these empirical or semi-empirical modifications [7,8,9,19], the NBD transmission function seems to agree more with the real transmission mechanics, in that it assumes that the mean of the number of effective contacts of the susceptible individuals with infectious individuals per unit time is different from individual to individual, and the choice of the Gamma distribution offers multiple advantages (see Section 2.1).",

Keeling et al. reviewed multiple types of networks and the statistical and analytical approaches for the spread of infectious diseases [13,14]. In particular, Bansal et al. demonstrated that the high-level heterogeneous degree distributions generate an almost immediate expansion phase compared to homogeneous degree distributions, such as the Poisson distribution [6,49,50]. The NBD-SEIR model does not exhibit this feature. We suspect that this is because our approach belongs to the mean-field class of approaches and considers a large population at the overall level. In addition, it is possible to approximate the main features of disease spread in networks with compartmental models using an appropriate construction. The work in [20] used R0 as a fundamental parameter to formulate a mean-field type model, which can implicitly capture some important effects of heterogeneous-mixing in contact networks. The work in [51,52] applied \u201cedge-based compartmental modeling\u201d (EBCM), which focuses on the status of a random partner rather than a random individual, to capture the heterogeneous contact rates in disease transmission.",

First, the parameter k characterizes the level of heterogeneity, which is difficult to measure directly, and this can be overcome by using contact tracing data.

In future research, it will be interesting to incorporate other factors that influence transmission dynamics, such as the migration of populations, seasonality and vaccinations, among others.",

The developed model considers the heterogeneity of contact rates in the population. The simulation results show that, at the population level, the dynamics vary widely according to the level of heterogeneity in contact rates. Once R0>1, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing models. Keeping other conditions identical, as the level of heterogeneity increases, the transmission speed becomes more and more slowly, the peak size becomes smaller and smaller. These results have implications for developing interventions, such as isolation, targeted vaccination, among others.",
