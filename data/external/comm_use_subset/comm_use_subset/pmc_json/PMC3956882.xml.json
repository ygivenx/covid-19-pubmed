SOCS3 is an inhibitor that is relatively specific to STAT3; in addition, it can inhibit other signaling pathways such as Ras/ERK and PI3K, which affect cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation [5], [6]. Th2 cells contain high levels of SOCS3 proteins. Our group has recently described and increased SOCS3 expression in eosinophils from asthmatic patients [7].",

Moreover, IL-4 is one of the key cytokine regulating the differentiation to the Th2 phenotype. Similarly, we have found high levels of IL-13 in the airways of asthmatic mice. This IL has been traditionally related to an increase in AHR [17]. There have been many efforts to find inhibitors of these 2 cytokines, but the outcomes have yet to fulfill expectations. Kasaian et al. has recently published a therapy in which a dual IL-4/IL-13 antagonist reduces lung inflammation, AHR and IgE production in an OVA-induced asthma murine model [18].

            "text": "MicroRNA-driven RNA interference is a newly recognized and evolutionary conserved regulatory mechanism [32]. We have used microarray analysis to determine miRNAs expression profiles in our chronic asthmatic mice after SOCS3-siRNA therapy. miRNA modulated by transient SOCS3 knock-down provide information about regulations operated at a postranscriptional level. Moreover, 2 of the miRNA that appeared downregulated after the SOCS3-siRNA therapy (miR-146b and 126) have been previously involved in asthma disease [32], [33]. It would be worthwhile to conduct further studies of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of those miRNAs and others we have found.",

Quantification of the cathepsin-activated ProSense 680 signal provides a noninvasive measure of pulmonary eosinophilia due to specific protease activation of ProSense by eosinophils [34]. Moreover, FMT results have been further corroborated by conventional, invasive techniques and ex vivo measurements. In addition, X-ray computed tomography has provided structural and anatomical lung information about the chronicity in asthma, showing higher density regions in lungs where the inflammatory process is taking place. These brighter areas associated with fluid accumulation were reduced after SOCS3-siRNA therapy. All together, these 2 new techniques allow us to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize and quantify inflammation in the lung and monitor therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",

Furthermore, as in T cells and eosinophils, other cells in the airways are probably over-expressed SOCS3, and our therapy allows the siRNA to be taken up by other cells in the airways, thus increasing their effectiveness. These two different approaches have lead to different results. Thankfully to the local therapy, the siRNA has the ability to down regulate SOCS3 in the whole lung environment; thus, we have obtained reduced levels of IL17A mRNA and in turn, increased expression of IL-10. However, the T cell treatment with SOCS3 siRNA reported by Moriwaki et al. produced increased IL17 levels in BAL fluids.",
