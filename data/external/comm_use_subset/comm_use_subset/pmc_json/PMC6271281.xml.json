Gold-based medicines were being used in China and the Middle East as far back as 3500 years ago and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2) was used as a diuretic during the Renaissance period, for example [2,3]. More recently in the early twentieth century Paul Ehrlich, who coined the term \u201cchemotherapy\u201d, developed Salvarsan, an arsenical, as a drug for the treatment of syphilis [4]. Contemporary medicinal inorganic chemistry though is a relatively young but vibrant research discipline. There are many excellent examples of metal-based therapeutics and diagnostics, metal chelators and inhibitors of metalloproteins in the clinic, for example Figure 1, or in development and our knowledge of the roles of metal ions in biological systems is continuing to expand [3,5].",

Careful selection of metals and manipulation of geometries, coordination numbers and redox states by selection of appropriate ligands can lead to the regulation of electronic, chemical and photophysical properties. Individual ligands also contribute greatly to structural diversity and modulate stability, ligand exchange kinetics and second coordination sphere interactions. In turn the prediction and control of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of compounds together with the developments in relation to metallomics provide the opportunity to develop metal-based drugs with bespoke mechanisms of action [3,5].",

In 1753 Claude Francois Geoffroy demonstrated bismuth to be a distinct element, as opposed to being elemental tin or lead. It is primarily found as bismuthinite (bismuth sulfide) and bismite (bismuth oxide) ores and sourced as a by-product of lead, copper and tin mining. It is naturally monoisotopic (209Bi) and can be considered to be the heaviest stable element, given its theoretical half-life is 1.9 \u00d7 109 years [11]. Radioactive bismuth-212 (212Bi) and bismuth-213 (213Bi) in contrast have half-lives of 60.6 and 45.6 min respectively, and may have important roles to play as radiometals in radiopharmaceuticals [3,12].",

Bi has a ground state electronic configuration of [Xe]4f145d106s26p3 and trivalent and pentavalent Bi, Bi(III) and Bi(V), respectively, are the two predominant oxidation states. In general the three 6p electrons are involved in bond formation and in the majority of compounds Bi is in the +3 oxidation state. Such compounds possess a so-called inert 6s2 pair of electrons, which can have a stereochemical effect. These two 6s electrons can be involved in bonding though and many examples of organobismuth(V) compounds are known [13]. BiF5 is the only Bi(V) halide known. Given Bi(V) is a very strong oxidant in aqueous solutions (BiV/BiIII E0 = 2.03 V) it is noteworthy that Bi(V) is generally not stable in biological solutions [14].",

Bi(III) is classified as a borderline Lewis acid according to the Hard Soft Acids Bases (HSAB) theory and therefore can form weak complexes with hard Lewis bases for example [18]. In general though Bi(III) is known to have a high affinity for oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur ligands. An affinity for thiolate ligands is considered to be an important property of Bi(III) in biological systems [14]. Bi(III) also has a relatively large ionic radius (1.16 \u00c5), which can facilitate the formation of interesting complexes with higher coordination numbers and a wide range of geometries [19,20].",

            "text": "Bi(III) as mentioned has an affinity for thiolate ligands and thiolation of Bi(III) is thought to be the major biochemical fate of Bi(III) in cells and biological fluids [14,24]. Bi(III) readily binds to the cysteine thiolate groups of amino acids and peptides for example. The crystal structure of Bi(Cys)3 was solved by X-ray crystallography demonstrating that Bi(III) can bind three cysteine thiolate groups and at physiological pH (Figure 2b). The average Bi-S bond length is ca. 2.54 \u00c5 [23]. Furthermore Bi(III) has been demonstrated to bind to glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide antioxidant, which is found at high concentrations in animal cells (ca. 5 mM). ESI-MS data indicates that Bi(III) and GSH bind at ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 [25]. A previous study by Sadler et al. had shown that the deprotonated thiol groups of GSH were the strongest binding site for Bi(III) and Bi(GSH)3 is stable over a pH range of 2\u201310. A formation constant for Bi(GSH)3 of log K = 29.6 was determined, using 1H-NMR upon titration of GSH with [Bi(Hedta)]. Bi(GSH)3 is therefore more stable than Bi(III) complexes with edta (log K = 27.8) or citrate (log K = 13.5) for example [24]. Significantly spin-echo 1H-NMR experiments demonstrated that RBC reacts with GSH in red blood cells both in vivo and in vitro [24]. There are numerous studies of Bi(III) binding to longer peptide sequences [26,27,28].",

Yang et al. recently reported the crystal structure of a Bi-bound hTF (BiNFeC-hTF) where the Bi(III) is found at the N-lobe, as per Figure 4a, and the Fe(III) at the C-lobe. The Bi(III) centre is bound by one tyrosine residue (Tyr188), a bidentate carbonate anion (synergistic anion), a tridentate nitrilotriacetate (NTA-3H) and a water molecule, Figure 4b. Bi(NTA-3H) was used in the preparation of BiNFeC-hTF [42]. Significantly in addition to providing valuable information on the binding mode of Bi(III) with hTF, this structure also strongly supports the theory that hTF does have a potential role in Bi-based drug delivery.",

This decline continued until the discovery of H. pylori in the 1980s after which bismuth emerged as a component of effective treatments for many gastrointestinal disorders [47]. The efficacy of the bismuth preparations in the treatment of many of these disorders has been attributed to a number of different actions against H. pylori and cytoprotective effects in the gastric mucosa.",

Subsequently H. pylori has become associated with dyspepsia, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer [48]. More recently H. pylori has been linked with extragastric diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, sideropenic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune diseases and gallbladder cancer for example [49]. It is estimated that about 50 percent of the world\u2019s population is infected with H. pylori, though the majority of infected people (>80%) do not develop any associated diseases [50].",

ADH can produce acetaldehyde which forms adducts with phospholipids and exogenous proteins thereby damaging gastric cells and causing mucosal damage. Jin et al. suggest that inhibition of ADH is due to direct interference at the zinc binding sites through interaction with thiol groups [65,66,67,68]. Bi is also known to interact with/inhibit fumarase [70] translational factor Ef-Tu [71] phospholipase A [72] and pepsin [73]. Though the exact mechanism of action of the anti-bacterial activity associated with Bi has yet to be elucidated, the majority of available evidence points towards Bi interacting with cysteine residues on key proteins or Bi interference at thiol-containing metal binding sites in various target proteins in H. pylori.",

The anti-ulcer effects of CBS may well be more complicated than straightforward precipitation at the ulcer crater though given it is known that even though CBS forms an insoluble precipitate at acidic pH, Bi is taken up by gastric and intestinal mucosal tissue and Bi is capable of interacting with numerous cellular proteins [14].

Reaction of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (H3Ssal, Figure 7a) with BiPh3 gave the heteroleptic carboxylate-sulfonate complexes [PhBi(HSal)H2O]\u221e and [PhBi(HSal)EtOH]\u221e where 5-sulfosalicylic acid is doubly deprotonated. Reaction of 5-sulfosalicylic acid with Bi(OAc)3 gave the homoleptic complex, {[Bi(HSal)(H2Sal)(H2O)3]2.2H2O}\u221e, where 5-sulfosalicylic acid is found to be both singly and doubly deprotonated [75]. The molecular structure of [PhBi(HSal)H2O]\u221e is shown in Figure 7b. The Bi centre is six-coordinate and the geometry is pentagonal pyramidal. The sterochemically active lone pair is trans to the phenyl group found at the apical position. The ethanol complex, [PhBi(HSal)EtOH]\u221e, was determined to be insoluble in aqueous solution whereas the two remaining complexes were remarkably water soluble resulting in solutions of pH 1.5. It is reported that the development of Bi complexes which are not water soluble at low pH is desirable given the links between potentially toxicity, absorption and water solubility. At pH 2 BSS, CBS and RBC are insoluble in aqueous solutions for example. Nonetheless all three complexes had reported MIC values of <6.25 \u00b5g/mL against three laboratory strains of H. pylori (B128, 251 and 26695). Such activities compare favourably with those of BSS (\u226412.5 \u00b5g/mL) and 5-sulfosalicylic acid (>25 \u00b5g/mL) [75].",

In summary, eradication of H. pylori is an important goal for the global scientific community given its association with dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.

Hydrazone derivatives are known to possess anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activities [95], though in this study the ligands investigated were found to be inactive against the panel of microorganisms investigated. In contrast and in general upon coordination to Bi(III) the anti-microbial activity of the hydrazone derivatives was enhanced against the Gram-positive bacteria though less notably against the Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa). Significantly the Bi(III) complexes were more active than their Sb(III) analogues and the Bi(III) hydrazone complex, [Bi(HAcpNO2Ph)Cl2], where H2AcpNO2Ph is 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(para-nitrobenzoylhydrazone), was found to be more active than tetracycline against S. aureus [95].

Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic and development of Bi-based ciprofloxacin compounds was therefore an interesting strategy for the targeting of anti-microbial resisitance [96,97]. Two Bi(III) ciprofloxacin (cf) compounds were reported; (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6]\u00b72H2O and (cfH2)2[Bi2Cl10]\u00b72H2O (cf = 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid) [96,97]. No bonding between the quinolone and Bi(III) was observed though as the quinolones are either singly protonated (cfH) at piperazine N or doubly protonated (cfH2) at the carbonyl O and piperazine N. In (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6]\u00b72H2O the six chloride ions coordinate Bi(III) with octahedral geometry to give [BiCl6]3\u2212 anions, whereas in (cfH2)2[Bi2Cl10]\u00b72H2O the Bi(III) is coordinated by chloride ions to give a centrosymmetric [Bi2Cl10]4\u2212 anion. Antimicrobial testing of (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6] against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi was undertaken. In summary the compound exhibited similar activity as cf\u00b7HCl against the Gram-negative (E. coli, P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, E. facecalis, B. Subtilis, B. cereus) and no activity against the fungi (C. albicans, T. mentagrophytes and A. niger) investigated [96,97]. Both (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6] and (cfH2)2[Bi2Cl10] were also demonstrated to have similar activity as cf.HCl against S. viridians, Enterococcus sp. and S. haemolyticus G, which are resistant to ciprofloxacin. The authors appropriately discuss the potential impact on speciation of dissolving their compounds in DMSO and increasing the pH on diluting the compound with media and serum for example. BiCl3 for example is known to form BiOCl readily in aqueous solutions and Bi(III) dimethyl sulfoxide complexes will also potentially form when Bi(III) complexes are dissolved in dmso as evidenced by the structure in Figure 10c,e [95].",

There is a definite lack of reports in relation to Bi-based drugs as anti-fungal agents with little or no publications investigating possible anti-fungal mechanisms of action of Bi compounds. Accordingly exciting opportunities and challenges exist in this area.",

The epidemiology of the contracted disease depends on the strain and characteristic of the parasite species as well as other contributing factors. It is reported to be prevalent in 98 countries worldwide, where over 350 million people are at risk of contracting the disease. 12 million are reported to have leishmaniasis with a further estimated two million new cases occurring every year [104].",

            "text": "The exact mode of action and site of action of the Sb-based drugs is for the most part unknown. It is widely accepted that the pentavalent Sb(V) is reduced to Sb(III) in the macrophages and parasitic cells by different thiols including cysteine, cysteine glycine and trypanothione [63,110]. Proposed biomolecular targets include the trypanothione synthase and reductase system. Trypanothione is a form of gluthatione, specific to the parasite in question. Trypanothione synthase, (TS), conjugates glutathione and spermidine to form trypanothione (N1-N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), while trypanothione reductase (TR), keeps the molecule in its reduced form. The TS and TR systems are essential for survival of the parasites and the Typanosomatidae family as they rely on it to replace the redox functions of systems such as the glutathione reductase system present in other organisms. Crystal structures revealed the Sb binding site in TR and thus provided the molecular basis for antimonial inhibition of TR. Upon reduction of TR by NADPH, a disulphide bridge associated with two cysteine residues (Cys52 and Cys57) separates to form two thiolate groups, just 4.4 \u00c5 apart. The Sb(III) ion is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry by the two aforementioned cysteinate sulphurs, one threonine (Thr335) and one histidine (His461) from a second TR that forms a dimer complex. Comparison of the reduced TR Sb(III) NADPH complex structure with trypanothione bound TR from L. cruzi shows that Sb(III) is binding at the catalytic site of the enzyme (Figure 12c). Sb(III) therefore works by preventing interaction between the two sulphur atoms of the cysteine residues with His461, which acts as a proton exchanger in the reduction mechanism associated with glutathione reductase [111]. Ultimately the parasite\u2019s ability to buffer oxidative stress is thought to be decreased [112].",

Eighteen bis(O-alkyldithiocarbanato) metal complexes were synthesized in total and their anti-cancer activity at pH 6.8 and 7.4 against Calu-6 (lung) and MCF-7 (breast) cancer cell lines were investigated and compared to the activity of cisplatin and bis(O-alkyldithiocarbanato) Pt complexes. The Pd complexes performed the best, followed by Bi complexes such as those shown in Figure 19e. Bi(S2COR)3 where R is isopropyl for example has an IC50 of 11.2 \u00b5M as compared to cisplatin\u2019s 27.21 \u00b5M. In addition the Bi complexes were also found to be more active at pH 6.8 than 7.4 [121]. pH 6.8 was investigated given the assertion that solid tumours often have pH\u2019s of 6.8 and lower [121].",

The peptides are analogues of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and target the GRP receptor, which is expressed on all invasive prostatic carcinomas but not benign prostatic tissue at high density. Significantly at MTD\u2019s (25 MBq) both 213Bi-labelled peptides were more effective than the 177Lu-DOTA-PESIN where 177Lu is a \u03b2\u2212-emitting isotope, indicating that the \u03b1-therapy was found to be better than \u03b2\u2212-therapy in this study.",

            "text": "Bi may also have a number of indirect roles to play in relation to treating cancer/tackling the incidence of cancer. Bi has been linked with the alleviation of side effects associated with cisplatin treatment for example [133,134,135]. Nephrotoxicity is a significant dose-limiting factor in cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Administration of Bi(III) salts prior to cisplatin treatment has been shown to depress the renal toxicity associated with cisplatin treatment. This renoprotective effect is thought to be due to Bi increasing metallothionein production in the kidneys [24,133,134,135]. More recently, Leussink et al. investigated the genomic basis of the renoprotective effect by treating NRK-52E cells, a cell line of rat proximal tubular epithelial origin, with Bi(III) salts. Subtraction PCR and microarray techniques were used to detect differentially expressed genes in treated and untreated NRK-52E cells. Down regulated (0.17\u20130.31-times) genes include cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, BAR (an apoptosis regulator), heat-shock protein 70-like protein, and ribosomal proteins S7 and L17, and S1, proteins belonging to the translation machinery. The single gene to be identified as being upregulated was glutathione S-transferase subunit 3A [136].",
