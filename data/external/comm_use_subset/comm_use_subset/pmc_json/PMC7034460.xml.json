These diseases could originate from both newly recognized and re-emerging existing infectious agents that present with increasing frequency and geographic range (Jones et al., 2008). EIDs often have enormous pandemic potential because of the minimal immunity among the human population, constituting one of the most pressing challenges to global public health (Frost, Li, Moolenaar, & Xie, 2019).",

Working at the emergency departments (EDs), emergency nurses act as the gatekeeper of the healthcare system by identifying suspected and confirmed patients with EID infections through meticulous assessment of reporting criteria such as disease manifestations, contact history, and travel history (Lam, Kwong, Hung, Pang, & Chien, 2019a). Also, the emergency nurses\u2019 role in controlling the spread of EIDs by performing and maintaining high-quality infection control measures is imperative (Lam, Kwong, Hung, & Pang, 2016). Moreover, they are often involved in patient logistic arrangements within departments and hospitals. This task involves offering appropriate quarantine arrangements for suspected and confirmed patients in ED and allocating potential infectious patients to appropriate destinations and specialities (Lam & Hung, 2013). Such participations of emergency nurses in the management of EIDs are considered of vital importance for minimizing the risk of disease transmission among patients, staff, visitors, and communities (Lam, Kwong, Hung, Pang, & Chien, 2019b).",

Previous studies on emergency nurses\u2019 compliance with infection control recommendations and guidelines have highlighted that their performance could be seriously hampered during epidemics (Carter, Pouch, & Larson, 2014). For instance, in an observational study of emergency nurses\u2019 adherence to infection prevention practices during the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Chacko & Camacho, 2016), it was revealed that more than 40% of the emergency nurses were not complying with the guidelines in the use of personal protective equipment. Also, although considered to be the single most important measure in the prevention of the spread of infections, almost one-fourth of the nurses in the study (23%) had demonstrated hand hygiene practices that fell below standard. Given that such inconsistencies of practice standard among emergency nurses would inevitably affect the public health preparedness and response capacity of healthcare systems, the need to understand the antecedents of the variations in their behaviours while performing duties against EIDs is highlighted.",

Individuals\u2019 risk appraisal and perception, which depicts the perceived susceptibility to a threat to health, is considered the essential constituent that mediates attitude change and navigates decision making (Rogers, 1975; Slovic, 1987). This concept has been used extensively in the literature in understanding individuals\u2019 judgement and motivation in certain health-related behaviours, such as treatment adherence (Garavalia, Garavalia, Spertus, & Decker, 2009; Kartal & Ozsoy, 2007) and vaccination (Raftopoulos, 2007; Rhodes & Hergenrather, 2003). The concept of risk perception has also been applied to the prediction of intentions and behaviours regarding the compliance of practice among health workers (Efstathiou, Papastavrou, Raftopoulos, & Merkouris, 2011). Indeed, previous research has established that nurses\u2019 compliance with precautionary measures is primarily related to their personal anticipation of the level of risk for acquiring an infectious disease (Grady, Shortridge, Davis, & Klinger, 1993; Osborne, 2003; Williams, Campbell, Henry, & Collier, 1994). Taken together, these studies support the notion that understanding the factors influencing emergency nurses\u2019 risk appraisal regarding different EIDs could offer relevant insights into their inconsistent attitudes and behaviours in EID management.",

            "text": "However, a significant knowledge gap exists in the understanding of emergency nurses\u2019 perceptions regarding the risk appraisal of the threat of epidemic events. Although extensive research has been carried out in exploring the association between risk perception and decision-making among nurses and health workers in susceptible situations, previous studies have predominantly focused on the effects of risk being perceived on precautionary behaviours in infection control. There is a current paucity of empirical research focusing especially on the nature of an EID situation that influences risk appraisal. In addition, whilst some research has been carried out on the factors affecting nurses\u2019 infection control practices, there have been few investigations into such area, particularly within emergency care settings. Thus, the present study aimed at addressing such knowledge gaps by exploring emergency nurses\u2019 perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the EID situation in the emergency department context. It is anticipated that the findings can provide useful information in understanding how emergency nurses appraise the risk from an epidemic event, addressing the existing knowledge gap regarding the inconsistencies of emergency nurses\u2019 practices during different episodes of epidemics. Consequently, this might aid the development of strategies and tactic in enhancing the compliance and consistency among emergency nurses regarding the adoption of infection control measures during infectious disease outbreaks.",

Employing a qualitative descriptive design can facilitate the understanding of the phenomenon of interest by gathering a rich and literal description of the insider views and perspectives (Bradshaw, Atkinson, & Doody, 2017).

A purposive sampling method was employed in the present study to recruit eligible participants. This sampling method can help researchers to facilitate the collection of relevant and useful information required for the study by identifying information-rich participants (Etikan, Musa, & Alkassim, 2016). With the use of a purposive sampling method, participants were recruited on the basis of their eligibility. Participants were considered eligible and invited to take part in the study if they (1) worked as a fulltime emergency nurse in public hospitals in Hong Kong; (2) were involved in active and direct provision of emergency care to patients at work, and (3) were willing to share their opinions and thoughts. Since the present study emphasized the experience of frontline emergency nurses, emergency nurses who were at the managerial position were excluded in the present study. Eligible individuals were approached through the social network of the members of the research team. Individuals who were interested in participating in the study were further contact through email. They were provided with the information sheet regarding the details of the study and the nature of their participation via email. The individuals were encouraged to ask questions for further information regarding the study. Participants who agreed to take part in the study were asked to sign an informed consent form on the date of data collection. Eventually, 24 emergency nurses participated in the present study. A summary of the demographic data of the participants was presented in Table I.\n",

To facilitate the process of data analysis, all the interviews were audio-taped with the permission of the participants. Before the commencement of the interviews, participants were encouraged to freely express their views and opinions about the research area. An interview guide, which consists of open-ended questions, was used in the interview process (Figure 1). The interview guide could offer directions for the interviews while preserving flexibility for the participants to communicate their thoughts and ideas (McIntosh & Morse, 2015). The average time of the interviews was 90 minutes, with a range from 60 minutes to 120 minutes.",

All the transcripts were checked against to make sure the correctness and accuracy of the transcription. Each transcript was then being analysed within one week following the completion of the corresponding interview. The process of data analysis in the present study followed the guideline of thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke (Braun & Clarke, 2006). As indicated in the guideline, the thematic analysis strategy consists of six primary phases: (1) familiarizing with data; (2) developing initial codes; (3) identifying possible themes; (4) refining preliminary themes; (5) finalizing relevant themes, and (6) producing a scholarly report. At the beginning of the data analysis process, the research team read and re-read the interview transcripts in a line-by-line and paragraph-by-paragraph manner to familiarize with the content of the data. Throughout the process, ideas from participants\u2019 narratives that were considered relevant to the phenomenon under study were highlighted to develop an initial list of codes. After scrutinizing the transcripts, codes with related meanings or consistent patterns were sorted to form themes. Themes were also generated through collating coherent codes across the entire dataset. These themes were examined again for the refinement of the structures within and between themes, developing a network of clustered and revised themes and sub-themes. Themes that were considered relevant and important to the study phenomenon were then named with phrases or statements that concisely portray the embedded notions within the themes. Eventually, extracts from the narratives of participants were selected to serve as examples to demonstrate the essence of each theme, establishing a plausible and relevant account of the phenomenon under study.",

Transferability was achieved through the provision of thick descriptions of the findings and research process, which enables future evaluations of whether the findings could be extended to other possible contexts. For dependability, it was established by implementing an inquiry audit to allow scrutiny of the appropriateness of the research steps, as well as the sincerity of the findings.

The majority of participants stated that the foremost position of the ED in healthcare service provision allowed them to recognize the havoc caused by EIDs in the community, and therefore they were able to realize and appraise the disease situation in their everyday work. One of the major elements that determine the severity of an EID and its impact on the general public was associated with the lethality of the disease, which, in other words, was the deadliness of the disease in terms of the human death toll. A nursing officer who had experienced the immense hardships at the time that SARS wreaked havoc around the globe remarked that some emergency nurses fled in panic during the outbreak, because of the high mortality rates among infected patients. As he said:\n\u201cAt the time of SARS, some of our colleagues requested to be reallocated to other departments instead of staying in the ED, while the disease had triggered the resignation of some nurses in our department. They thought the SARS was deadly because the mortality rate from infection is high.

A nursing officer indicated how she made sense of the transmission route of different EIDs while understanding their infectiousness as follows:\n\u201cThe mode of transmission is an important part of the nature of a disease that one has to understand in order to deal with it. For example, if I am to compare Ebola with SARS, in my personal understanding, the latter will be more devastating.

This system, which envisages a three-tiered response level (Alert, Serious, and Emergency), is a part of the preparedness plan announced by the Hong Kong government to depict epidemiological scenarios. The response levels are established based on the assessment of the outbreak risk of an EID and its impact on human health and healthcare organizations. The majority of participants commented that the response level for an EID is the most influential aspect in defining a disease situation. For example, one participant described how the progress of the EID disease situation could alter their practice as follows:\n\u201cWhenever there are changes in the alert level, for example, the level has been stepped up from Alert to Serious this month, there have been some corresponding modifications to our practice in workflow and disease prevention. I would then realise the situation is getting worse, and I am in greater danger.\u201d (P4)",

The participants mentioned that their risk perceptions would be grounded in their impressions and interpretations of the infectiousness, severity, proximity, and complexity of an EID situation.

According to the participants\u2019 description, such a vulnerability is portrayed as the novelty, severity, proximity, and complexity of an EID and its corresponding situation. In line with those previous studies, the risk of exposure to a disease is often considered an important factor that influences nurses\u2019 risk perception. Findings from various studies have identified an elevated infection rate in nurses during EID events. For example, a small-scale study by Wise et al. (Wise et al., 2011) reported that nurses were significantly susceptible to influenza infection during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. In addition, in a previous study (Olu et al., 2015) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in hospital workers, it was identified that over half of the infections occurred in nurses, despite the fact that they had previously been trained in infection prevention. Indeed, nurses considered physical exposure to patients with confirmed or probable infection to be the significant risk factor in the course of their work (Cheong et al., 2007; Imai et al., 2008; Tzeng & Yin, 2006; Wong et al., 2008). A possible explanation for the perceived risk of occupationally acquired infection among nurses was that nurses are frequently engaged in high-risk patient care activities during routine clinical practice. These patient care activities, such as suctioning, nasogastric feeding, and intubation of infected patients, can put nurses at risk for infection. In addition, nurses\u2019 practice settings are considered to significantly affect their perceived occupational risk of infection. Emergency nurses were frequently cited to demonstrate additional perceived risks for contracting an infection (Parmeggiani, Abbate, Marinelli, & Angelillo, 2010). It is also reported that emergency nurses found themselves particularly vulnerable and susceptible to infections during an EID outbreak (Lam & Hung, 2013; Venkat et al., 2012). It is suggested in the literature that emergency nurses\u2019 risk perceptions were associated with the additional threat embedded in the practice of emergency care, in which they constitute the public health frontline of defence in the course of an outbreak. Indeed, the environment of EDs is commonly considered a high-risk workplace, where emergency nurses are prone to outbreak exposure (Wu et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Another important finding of the present study is the influences of the response level for an EID on emergency nurses\u2019 risk appraisal of EID situations. It is underlined in the findings that the existing index and scale classifying the severity of EIDs are important indicators for emergency nurses to address the disease situations in epidemic events. Indeed, the response level clearly signposts the progress of an EID and strongly influences emergency care delivery and emergency nurses\u2019 routine practice. However, the current international classification scheme, namely the World Health Organization (WHO) global phase of pandemic alert (World Health Organization, 2009), only reflects the severity and progress seen in an influenza pandemic. There is an absence of a consensual categorization system for other EIDs, which has resulted in uncertainty and discrepancies in assessing the risk and seriousness of non-influenza EID events. A key policy priority should, therefore, be to devise a well-established alert system, which could accommodate disease situations for various EIDs. Such an alert system could offer essential information regarding the evolving picture of different EID events at the local, national, and global level, providing guidance to healthcare facilities and institutes in preparing a response to EIDs. Frontline healthcare workers, especially emergency nurses, could then appraise a disease situation with improved clarity, which might reduce their uncertainty, contributing to improved alertness and vigilance towards possible EID outbreaks.",

As portrayed in the findings, emergency nurses developed different levels of a sense of anticipated crises in the face of different EID events, which might create considerable fear and anxiety as to their personal wellness. Interestingly, it is suggested in the literature that such a sense of crisis might foster nurses\u2019 awareness of the severity of the disease situation, enhancing their vigilance against EIDs. On the other hand, it has previously been observed that if healthcare workers underestimate the severity of a public health event, it could result in laxness in handling and fulfiling the tasks required (Balicer, Omer, Barnett, & Everly, 2006; Cava, Fay, Beanlands, McCay, & Wignall, 2005). Thus, the findings shed some light on the importance of maintaining an optimal level of risk perception and crisis awareness among nurses during an EID event, to promote their alertness and prudence at work but without triggering panic.",

In addition, the nature and characteristics of an EID situation might not exclusively constitute the participants\u2019 risk appraisal. Thus, further investigations incorporating other possible factors, such as cultural issues or organizational environment, could be considered. Notwithstanding these limitations, the present study offered useful insights into the understanding of the factors influencing the risk appraisal towards EIDs among emergency nurses.",
