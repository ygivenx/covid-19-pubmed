            "text": "Enzymes are biomacromolecules that catalyze almost all the chemical reactions essential for the life of a cell [1]. Most enzymes are proteins although some RNA molecules have been identified to possess the function of enzyme as well. As catalysts, enzymes possess two exceptional features: one is of high efficiency and the other of high selectivity. For instance, the second-order rate constant between some enzymes and their substrates [2] was surprisingly high [3], which could almost reach the upper limit of diffusion-controlled reaction rate according to the calculation and analysis by Chou and coworkers [4\u20136]. The high selectivity or specificity of enzymes was likened to the \u201clock-and-key\u201d model, implying that an accurate fit is required between the active site of an enzyme and its substrate for the catalytic reaction to occur. Owing to the previous unique features, enzymes play a crucial role in controlling and regulating the order of chemical reactions in cells that is vitally important for their survival. It is also because of this that enzymes are excellent drug targets, and actually many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. For example, some peptide inhibitors against HIV/AIDS [7\u201310] and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) [11\u201313] were based on the Chou's distorted key theory [14], as illustrated in Figure 1, where (a) shows a good fit for a cleavable octapeptide with the active site of HIV-protease and (b) shows that the peptide has become an ideal inhibitor or \u201cdistorted key\u201d after its scissile bond is modified. For a brief introduction about the Chou's distorted key theory and its application for designing peptide drugs, see a Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chou's_distorted_key_theory_for_peptide_drugs.",

            "text": "To develop enzyme-targeting drugs, an essential step is to identify drug-enzyme interaction in cellular networking [15]. The completion of the human genome project and the emergence of molecular medicine have provided excellent opportunity to discover unknown target enzymes for drugs. Many efforts were made in this regard by computationally analyzing drug-enzyme interactions. The most commonly used approaches are docking simulations (see, e.g., [16\u201319]) and protein cleavage site analysis (see, e.g., [8, 12, 13]) based on Chou's distorted key theory [14]. However, the latter approach is mainly used to find peptide drugs. Compared with the smaller organic compounds, although peptide drugs have the advantage of low toxicity to human body, they have the shortcoming of poor metabolic stability and low bioavailability due to their inability to readily crossing thru membrane barriers such as the intestinal and blood-brain barriers [20]. In contrast, the molecular docking is indeed a useful vehicle for investigating the interaction of an enzyme receptor with its organic inhibitor and revealing their binding mechanism as demonstrated by a series of studies [11, 19\u201323]. However, to conduct molecular docking, a necessary prerequisite is the availability of the 3D (three dimensional) structure of the targeted enzyme. Unfortunately, the 3D structures of many enzymes are still unknown. Although X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool in determining the 3D structures of enzymes, it is time-consuming and expensive. Particularly, not all enzymes can be successfully crystallized. For example, membrane enzymes are very difficult to crystallize and most of them will not dissolve in normal solvents. Therefore, so far very few membrane enzyme 3D structures have been determined. Although NMR is indeed a very powerful tool in determining the 3D structures of membrane proteins as indicated by a series of recent publications (see, e.g., [24\u201330]), it is time-consuming and costly. To acquire the structural information in a timely manner, one has to resort to various structural bioinformatics tools (see, e.g., [18, 31, 32]). Unfortunately the number of templates for developing high quality 3D structures by structural bioinformatics is very limited.",

For the current study, the benchmark dataset \ud835\udd4a can be formulated as\n(1)\ud835\udd4a=\ud835\udd4a+\u222a\ud835\udd4a\u2212,\nwhere \ud835\udd4a\n+ is the positive subset that consists of the interactive enzyme-drug pairs only, while \ud835\udd4a\n\u2212 is the negative subset that contains of the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs only, and the symbol \u222a represents the union in the set theory. Here, the \u201cinteractive\u201d pair means the pair whose two counterparts are interacted with each other in the drug-target networks as defined in the KEGG database [38], while the \u201cnoninteractive\u201d pair means that its two counter parts are not interacted with each other in the drug-target networks.

Molecular fingerprints are bit-string representations of molecular structure and properties [42]. It should be pointed out that there are many types of structural representations that have been suggested for the description of drug molecules, including physicochemical properties [43], chemical graphs [44], topological indices [45], 3D pharmacophore patterns, and molecular fields. In the current study, let us use the simple and generally adopted 2D molecular fingerprints to represent drug molecules, as described below.",

The current version of OpenBabel can generate four types of fingerprints: FP2, FP3, FP4, and MACCS. In the current study, we used the FP2 fingerprint format. It is a path-based fingerprint that identifies small molecule fragments based on all linear and ring substructures and maps them onto a bit-string using a hash function (somewhat similar to the daylight fingerprints [47, 48]). It is a length of 256-bit hexadecimal string obtained from the OpenBabel, and we can convert it to a 256-bit vector. Then, a molecular fingerprint can be formulated as a 256-D vector given by\n(2)MF=[A1\u22efAj\u22efA256]T,\nwhere A\nj (j = 1,2,\u2026, 256) is an integer between 0 and 15, and T is the matrix transpose operator.",

At first suppose S(q) = m\nr + 1, and see whether S(q) is the substring for the subsequence S(1 \u2192 r), which means deleting the last symbol from the substring S(1 \u2192 r)S(q).

            "text": "The sequences of the enzymes involved in this study are given in Online Supporting Information S2. Now the problem is how to effectively represent these enzyme sequences for the current study. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of approaches to formulate enzyme sequences: the sequential model and the nonsequential or discrete model [51]. The most typical sequential representation for an enzyme sample E with L residues is its entire amino acid sequence; that is,\n(9)E=R1R2R3R4R5R6R7\u22efRL,\nwhere R\n1 represents the 1st residue, R\n2 the 2nd residue, and so forth. An enzyme sample thus formulated can contain its most complete information. This is an obvious advantage of the sequential representation. To get the desired results, the sequence-similarity-search-based tools, such as BLAST [52, 53], are usually utilized to conduct the prediction. However, this kind of approach failed to work when the query enzyme did not have significant homology to enzyme of known characters. Thus, various nonsequential representation models were proposed. The simplest nonsequential model for an enzyme was based on its amino acid composition (AAC), as defined by\n(10)E=[f1f2\u22eff20]T,\nwhere f\nu (u = 1,2,\u2026, 20) are the normalized occurrence frequencies of the 20 native amino acids [54\u201356] in the enzyme E, and T has the same meaning as in (2) and (8). The AAC-discrete model was widely used for identifying various attributes of proteins (see, e.g., [57\u201361]). However, as can be seen from (10), all the sequence order effects were lost by using the AAC-discrete model. This is its main shortcoming. To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information, the pseudo amino acid composition [62, 63] or Chou's PseAAC [3] was proposed to replace the simple AAC model. Since the concept of PseAAC was proposed in 2001 [62], it has penetrated into almost all the fields of protein attribute predictions and computational proteomics, such as predicting supersecondary structure [64], predicting metalloproteinase family [65], predicting membrane protein types [66, 67], predicting protein structural class [68], discriminating outer membrane proteins [69], identifying antibacterial peptides [70], identifying allergenic proteins [71], identifying bacterial virulent proteins [72], predicting protein subcellular location [73, 74], identifying GPCRs and their types [75], identifying protein quaternary structural attributes [76], predicting protein submitochondria locations [77], identifying risk type of human papillomaviruses [78], identifying cyclin proteins [79], predicting GABA(A) receptor proteins [80], and predicting cysteine S-nitrosylation sites in proteins [81], among many others (see a long list of papers cited in the References section of [33]). Recently, the concept of PseAAC was further extended to represent the feature vectors of DNA and nucleotides [36, 82], as well as other biological samples (see, e.g., [83, 84]). Because it has been widely and increasingly used, recently two powerful soft-wares called \u201cPseAAC-Builder\u201d [85] and \u201cpropy\u201d [86] were established for generating various special Chou's pseudo-amino acid compositions, in addition to the web-server PseAAC [87] built in 2008. According to a recent review [33], the general form of Chou's PseAAC for an enzyme sample can be formulated by\n(11)E=[\u03c81\u03c82\u22ef\u03c8u\u22ef\u03c8\u03a9]T,\nwhere the subscript \u03a9 is an integer, and its value as well as the components \u03c8\nu (u = 1,2,\u2026, \u03a9) will depend on how to extract the desired information from the amino acid sequence of E (cf. (10)). Next, let us describe how to extract useful information from the benchmark dataset \ud835\udd4a and Online Supporting Information S2 to define the enzyme samples concerned via (11).",

Likewise, when N\n+\n\u2212 = 0 meaning none of the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs was mispredicted, we have the specificity Sp = 1; while N\n+\n\u2212 = N\n\u2212 meaning all the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs were incorrectly predicted as interactive enzyme-drug pairs, we have the specificity Sp = 0. When N\n\u2212\n+ = N\n+\n\u2212 = 0 meaning that none of the interactive enzyme-drug pairs in the dataset \ud835\udd4a\n+ and none of the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs in \ud835\udd4a\n\u2212 was incorrectly predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = \u039b = 1; while N\n\u2212\n+ = N\n+ and N\n+\n\u2212 = N\n\u2212 meaning that all the interactive enzyme-drug pairs in the dataset \ud835\udd4a\n+and all the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs in \ud835\udd4a\n\u2212 were mispredicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = \u039b = 0. The MCC correlation coefficient is usually used for measuring the quality of binary (two-class) classifications. When N\n\u2212\n+ = N\n+\n\u2212 = 0 meaning that none of the interactive enzyme-drug pairs in the dataset \ud835\udd4a\n+ and none of the noninteractive enzyme-drug pairs in \ud835\udd4a\n\u2212 were mispredicted, we have MCC = 1; when N\n\u2212\n+ = N\n+/2 and N\n+\n\u2212 = N\n\u2212/2, we have MCC = 0 meaning no better than random prediction; when N\n\u2212\n+ = N\n+ and N\n+\n\u2212 = N\n\u2212, we have MCC = \u22121 meaning total disagreement between prediction and observation. As we can see from the previous discussion, it is much more intuitive and easier-to-understand when using (34) to examine a predictor for its sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient. It is instructive to point out that the metrics as defined in (30) and (34) are valid for single label systems; for multilabel systems, a set of more complicated metrics should be used as given in [114].",

            "text": "How to properly examine the prediction quality is a key for developing a new predictor and estimating its potential application value. Generally speaking, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine a predictor of its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling or K-fold (such as 5-fold, 7-fold, or 10-fold) test, and jackknife test [108]. However, as elaborated by a penetrating analysis in [115], considerable arbitrariness exists in the independent dataset test. Also, as demonstrated by (27)\u2013(29) in [33], the subsampling test (or K-fold cross-validation) cannot avoid arbitrariness either. Only the jackknife test is the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. Therefore, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly utilized by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [66, 71, 74, 80]). Accordingly, the success rate by the jackknife test was also used to optimize the two uncertain parameters K and \u03c6 in (27). The result, thus, obtained is shown in Figure 3, from which we obtain when K = 6 and \u03c6 = 1.5 the iEzy-Drug predictor reaches its optimized status.",

In the ROC curve, the vertical coordinate Y is for the true positive rate or Sn (cf. (34)), while horizontal coordinate X for the false positive rate or 1-Sp. The best possible prediction method would yield a point with the coordinate (0, 1) representing 100% true positive rate (sensitivity Sn) and 0 false positive rate or 100% specificity. Therefore, the (0, 1) point is also called a perfect classification. A completely random guess would give a point along a diagonal from the point (0, 0) to (1, 1). The area under the ROC curve, also called Area Under the ROC (AUROC), is often used to indicate the performance quality of a binary classifier; the value 0.5 of AUROC is equivalent to random prediction, while 1 of AUROC represents a perfect one. As we can see from Figure 4, the AUROC value obtained by iEzy-Drug is 0.9377.",
