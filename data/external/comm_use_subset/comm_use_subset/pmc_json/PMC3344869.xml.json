In contrast, expression of CEA is frequently high in carcinomas, including colon, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, lung, breast, uterine, ovarian, and endometrial cancers [3]. Cancer cells not only lose polarized (luminal) expression of CEA, but actively cleave CEA from their surface by phospholipases, an action that results in serum concentrations of CEA that can approach 5 \u00b5g/mL [3], [4], [5]. Serum CEA levels may be monitored to detect a response to anti-cancer therapy, or disease recurrence in colorectal cancer [6], and serves as a prognostic indicator in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, where elevated levels indicate a poor prognosis and correlate with reduced overall survival [7], [8], [9].",

            "text": "As a novel CEA-directed therapy, we have developed a CEA-targeting bispecific single-chain antibody of the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) class termed MEDI-565 (also known as MT111) [16], [17], [18]. BiTE antibodies are a unique subclass of bispecific antibodies that contain one single chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for a tumor associated antigen molecularly fused to another scFv with specificity for CD3 on T cells [19]. Highly potent and specific tumor cell lysis is triggered only when BiTE antibodies bind both epitopes simultaneously, resulting in directing T cells to the tumor cells and activating the T cell through the CD3/T cell receptor (TCR) complex [20]. Notably, activation of T cells is independent of TCR specificity, peptide antigen presentation, and co-stimulatory signals [21]. As a result of T cell activation, granzymes and perforin are mobilized to the tumor cell-T cell interface and mediate an apoptotic killing of target cells; FAS ligand expression may also contribute to the induction of apoptosis through engagement of FAS on tumor cells [22], [23], [24]. BiTE antibodies activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets [23], [25], [26], [27], [28]; both subsets of T cells contribute to tumor cell killing at relatively low effector T cell:target tumor cell (E:T) ratios [22], [29]. Cytokine secretion and the upregulation of cell surface IL-2 receptor by T cells (measured experimentally using antibodies recognizing the IL-2R\u03b1 chain/CD25) occur simultaneously and accompany tumor cell killing [18], [22], [25]. Both potentiate further T cell activation and proliferation, facilitating the subsequent engagement and killing of additional tumor cells bound by a BiTE antibody. BiTE antibodies not only induce the potent lysis of human cancer cell lines in vitro, but have also been shown to mediate the killing of primary human tumor cells by cancer patient T cells ex vivo [17], [25], [30]. Furthermore, BiTE antibodies promote in vivo tumor regression in numerous pre-clinical animal models [16], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36] and have shown signs of clinical benefit in patients with cancer [37], [38], [39].",

It specifically binds to CEA and not to other CEACAM family members [16]. Upon concurrent binding to CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, MEDI-565 mediates T cell activation and the subsequent killing of CEA-expressing target cells in a perforin- and granzyme-dependent manner that is insensitive to concentrations up to 5 \u00b5g/mL of soluble CEA [16], [17], [18]. Furthermore, intravenous and subcutaneous administration of MEDI-565 had anticancer activity in severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models of various human cancers [18]; growth inhibition of the cancers was contingent on both the presence of un-stimulated human T cells and the expression of CEA on the cancer cells [18]. MEDI-565 is currently in phase I clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01284231) for the treatment of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.",

Five deletion mutants were constructed by removing the following IgC-like domains: A1, B1 and A2 domains (DelA1-A2), A1 domain (DelA1), B1 domain (DelB1), A2 domain (DelA2), and B2 and A3 domains (DelB2-A3) as shown in Figure 3A. The mutants were transiently expressed as GPI-anchored proteins on HEK293 F cells. The binding of MEDI-565 or the anti-CEA polyclonal control antibody to each of the deletion mutants was analyzed using flow cytometry. MEDI-565 did not recognize any of the deletion mutants which lack the A2 domain (DelA1-A2 and DelA2, Figure 3B), but bound well to all mutants that contained it (DelA1, DelB1 and DelB2-A3, Figure 3B). Additionally, when all but the A2 IgC-like domains were removed (A2; Figure 4B), MEDI-565 still recognized the corresponding truncated CEA protein at a level similar to that measured for full-length CEA protein (Figure 4C). These results suggested that the epitope of MEDI-565 is localized in the A2 domain of CEA.",

Two truncated CEA mutants (A2 and A3) were engineered and used as templates for the construction of swap mutants. The A2 or A3 mutant is comprised of the N-domain, the A2 or A3 domain, and the GPI region. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of the A2 and A3 domains identified differences in their aa composition. These regions of sequence diversity were divided into three shorter segments labeled as A (aa 326 to 349), B (aa 360 to 382) and C (aa 388 to 410) (Figure 4A). Six swap mutants were generated by swapping segments A, B or C of the A3 domain into the A2 domain (KO mutants), or by swapping segments of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI mutants) as shown in Figure 4B. MEDI-565 did not bind to any of the KO or KI mutants lacking either the A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A, KO_C, KI_A, KI_B and KI_C, Figure 4B, C), but bound well to the swap variant which encoded both the A and C segments of the A2 domain (KO_B, Figure 4B, C). Some residual binding of MEDI-565 to the KO_C mutant could be detected. Together with MEDI-565 lack of binding to KO_A mutant, this data indicated that segment C significantly contributed to MEDI-565 binding, but to a lesser degree than segment A. Due to the high degree of identity between segment B in the A2 and the A3 domains, direct involvement of this segment in MEDI-565 binding could not be entirely ruled out using a swap mutant-based approach. It is however unlikely for the following reasons 1) MEDI-565 did not bind to the mutants encoding the B segment of A2 domain in conjunction with either A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A or KO_C, Figure 4); 2) The binding level of MEDI-565 to the mutant encoding both the A and the C segments of A2 domain (KO_B) was comparable to the signal of both the full-length CEA and the A2 deletion mutant (Figure 4); and 3) The modeled structure of the A2 domain using murine CEACAM1 as a template revealed that segment B was spatially distal from critical residue N333 (see following section). Therefore, the swap-mutants revealed that MEDI-565 bound to a nonlinear epitope in the A2 domain of CEA, which is comprised of two segments, namely 326\u2013349 (segment A) and 388\u2013410 (segment C).",

The amino acids of segments A and C of the A2 domain that differed from the A3 domains were replaced with the corresponding A3 residues encoding several substitutions at a time: F326T328N333 (KO_FTN), N333 E338 (KO_NE), and E338L343I349 (KO_ELI) V388G389P390E392 (KO_VGPE); E398L399V401D402H403 (KO_ELVDH) and I408N410 (KO_IN) (Figure 4A). The binding of MEDI-565 was substantially decreased to the variants in which residue N333 was mutated (KO_FTN and KO_NE), but bound well to the other mutants (Figure 5A). Furthermore, replacing only residue N333 with either its counterpart residue Lys in the A3 domain (KO_N) or with Ala (N333 to A) abolished MEDI-565 binding (Figure 5C). Mutating the residue F326 or T328 to Ala substantially decreased the binding of MEDI-565 (F326 to A, T328 to A), suggesting that they were also involved in the interaction with MEDI-565 but to a lesser extent than residue N333 (Figure 5C). Taken together, our data demonstrated the importance of F326, T328, and N333. Finally, since E338 is encoded in the KO_ELI variant which binds well to MEDI-565, we concluded that this residue is not energetically involved in MEDI-565 epitope. We had previously noted that grafting only segment A that includes the F326, T328, and N333 residues of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI_A) did not result in MEDI-565 binding. This suggested that MEDI-565 binding epitope comprises additional critical residues and pointed towards it being non-linear and conformational.",

This observation suggested that these amino acids could contribute to the binding of MEDI-565 in concert with N333. Knocking-out amino acids V388G389P390E392 (KO_VGPE) or I408N410 (KO_IN) separately (Figure 5A), or knocking-in the entire segment C which includes both clusters of V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 (KI_C) (Figure 4C) had no effect in abolishing or restoring MEDI-565 binding, respectively.

Therefore, we further confirmed the potential epitope regions identified with knock-out variants by using gain of function (knock-in) mutants. Indeed, \u201cknocking in\u201d segments A (326\u2013349) and C (388\u2013410) of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KO_B/KI_A+C, KO_B encodes the same amino acids as KI_A+C) resulted in MEDI-565 binding comparable to full length CEA (Figure 4C, 5C). Furthermore, only grafting the three amino acids F326T328N333 of segment A with the six amino acids V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 of segment C into the A3 domain (KI_FTN+VGPE+IN) also resulted in MEDI-565 binding comparable to full length CEA (Figure 5C). In summary, these results demonstrate that the epitope of CEA bound by MEDI-565 is a nonlinear, conformational epitope located in the A2 domain of CEA; it is comprised of two segments of amino acids 326 to 349 and 388 to 410 with critical amino acids F326, T328, N333, V388, G389, P390, E392, I408, and N410.

Due to its concordant expression with full length CEA in human tumors, we sought to understand the binding of MEDI-565 to the CEA splice variant and the role that this CEA isoform might play in targeting CEA-positive tumors. The amino acids in full-length CEA important for MEDI-565 binding were found to be largely absent in the CEA splice variant, except amino acids I408 and N410 in segment C (Figure 2). This observation suggested that binding of MEDI-565 to the CEA splice variant was unlikely to occur. To test this hypothesis, CHO cells were infected with lentivirus constructs directing the expression of full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA) or the CEA splice variant (CHO SV CEA), or both concurrently after sequential infection of cells with the CEA splice variant then the full-length CEA (CHO FL+SV CEA); full-length CEA and CEA splice variant protein expression were verified by western blotting (Figure S1). As anticipated, MEDI-565 bound to cells expressing full-length CEA but not to cells expressing the CEA splice variant (Figure 6A). We note that a higher level of MEDI-565 binding was observed for cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full length CEA together relative to cells expressing only full length CEA. This is likely due to different levels of expression efficiency in each independently infected cell line, although effects of the CEA splice variant protein on full length CEA protein levels or epitope accessibility in cells cannot be ruled out.",

Co-expression of the CEA splice variant with full-length CEA on the same cells did not significantly affect the apparent binding affinity of MEDI-565 to full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA, apparent KD = 5.0\u00b10.15 nM; CHO FL+SV CEA, apparent KD = 5.6\u00b13.0 nM; p = 0.86).

Likewise MEDI-565 also did not mediate the lysis of target cells expressing the splice variant (Figure 6B).

The most extensive investigations involve the classification of 52 anti-CEA mAbs into five distinct epitopes, Gold epitopes 1\u20135, by competitive binding analysis [50]. Further studies have correlated the Gold epitopes to the domains of CEA using different CEA fragment constructs [51], [53], [54], however there is no precise localization of the epitopes to the amino acid sequence level. An attempt to identify the amino acid sequences corresponding to Gold epitopes using synthetic overlapping fifteen-mer peptides has failed [55], suggesting that the Gold epitopes are conformational. In addition, immunohistochemistry and immuno flow cytometry were used to demonstrate a good correlation between the Gold epitope groups and their binding specificity: 1) mAbs that bind to Gold epitopes 2 and 3 were generally specific to CEA, reacting only with colon carcinoma, normal colon mucosa and normal gastric foveola; 2) mAbs in epitopes 4 and 5 were highly cross-reactive with different normal tissues possibly due to binding to CEA-related antigens; and 3) both specific and cross-reactive mAbs were found in epitope 1 [56]. We have mapped the epitope of the CEA-specific arm of MEDI-565 to the A2 domain comprised of two stretches of amino acids, 326\u2013349 and 388\u2013410. Interestingly, the MEDI-565 epitope on CEA belongs to the Gold epitope 2, which has been localized in the A2-B2 domains [53] and identified as a CEA-specific epitope group [56].",

            "text": "After identifying the binding epitope of MEDI-565, we evaluated the impact of polymorphisms and isoforms in the A2 domain of CEA on the activity of MEDI-565. Two non-synonymous SNPs were identified in the binding epitope of MEDI-565 but occurred at a very low frequency in the general population and were considered to have little or no impact on MEDI-565 binding to CEA. In addition, a single splice variant was identified lacking a portion of the A2 domain critical for MEDI-565 binding. Efforts to understand the association of splice variant expression to disease found that its expression occurred in a substantial percentage of primary human colorectal and gastroesophageal tumors, and to a lesser extent in lung and breast tumors in a pattern that was concordant with full length CEA expression. However, since MEDI-565 did not bind the CEA splice variant due to loss of the antibody-binding epitope, it was clear that the splice variant itself is not a target for MEDI-565 in primary human tumors that also express full length CEA. Because CEA could participate in homotypic interactions on adjacent cells, it remained possible that expression of the CEA splice variant may interfere with the binding of MEDI-565 and the subsequent tumor cell lysis through its interaction with full length CEA. By co-expressing the CEA splice variant with full length CEA, we formally demonstrated that this was not the case, as MEDI-565 binding to full length CEA and potency of CEA-directed lysis were not significantly affected by simultaneous expression of the splice variant and full length CEA. Therefore, the expression of the CEA splice variant by primary human tumor cells is not anticipated to interfere with MEDI-565 binding to full-length CEA, nor should it inhibit MEDI-565-mediated T-cell killing of tumor cells expressing full-length CEA. However, discrimination of full-length CEA from the CEA splice variant may be important while monitoring the status of CEA positive tumors via changes in serum CEA levels in clinical study patients that receive MEDI-565.",

C, binding characteristics of MEDI-565 to CEA mutants with single or combinatorial mutations. Replacing N333 with Lys (KO_N) or Ala (N333 to A) disrupted the binding of MEDI-565 to the A2 domain.

Knocking-out the amino acids V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 together from the A2 domain also reduced MEDI-565 binding (KO_VGPE+IN).
