RSV is a widespread human pathogen because the immunity that is obtained after RSV infection might not be protective, frequently leading to reinfection. Approximately 90% of children become infected within the first two years of life, and this virus frequently re-infects older children and adults. The majority of patients with RSV infection develop upper respiratory illness, but a significant minority will present with lower respiratory tract illness, predominantly in the form of bronchiolitis.",

In the presence of lysis buffer, positive signals in RSV-infected cells were observed for both antibodies and a commercial monoclonal antibody against RSV NP. Western blotting revealed a major band at 46 kDa, indicating the reactivity of B11A5 and E8A11 against denatured RSV NP (Figure 2B).

The RNA copy number at the LOD (4.23 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL) of the FICT was determined by qRT-PCR. After preparing a virus at 4.23 \u00d7 106 TCID50/mL, 75 \u03bcL of the virus sample was used for RNA extraction. A calibration curve was generated by serially diluting the RNA standard of the RSV NP. A standard curve was created to show the starting copy number of the standard RNA on the X-axis versus the cycle threshold (Ct) on the Y-axis. The plot of the standard curve of Ct values against the logarithmic dilutions produced an r2 value = 0.992, and the slope (\u22123.736) corresponded to an efficiency in the range of 85.2% for RSV NP, which was close to that of the optimized protocol. The LOD of the FICT corresponded to a Ct value of 25.95 \u00b1 0.28 (mean \u00b1 SD) and an RNA copy number/reaction mixture of 4.75 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 5.8 \u00d7 105 (mean \u00b1 SD) for RSV NP (Figure 6).",
