These studies characterized several aspects of viral-host\ninteractions that influence disease severity. Experiments designed to tease out the\ncontribution of the virus and the host to the severity of host response reported\nthat specific mutations in the H5N1 viral genome affected the kinetics and magnitude\nof the host response, rather than changes in specific host response\nfactors8. Another study\nfound that early response signatures to influenza virus infection correlated with\nthe severity of late disease9.\nLipidomics analysis of mice infected with various influenza A virus strains of\nvarying pathogenicity have also been reported10. Similarly, the disease severity of SARS-CoV correlated\nwith the dysregulation of the urokinase pathway and an increase in fibrinolysin\npathway activity7. An integrated\nnetwork interrogation approach using both transcriptomic and proteomic data sets\npredicted a subset of key regulator molecules responding to SARS-CoV and influenza\ninfections that could be used as host targets for therapeutic intervention11,12. Genetic modification of non-structural protein 16 in\nSARS-CoV showed enhanced susceptibility to type I and III interferon responses,\nmaking it a good vaccine strain candidate13.",

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 (HPAI) has\nbeen commonly referred to as \u2018Avian Flu\u2019 as it is\nendemic in bird populations. HPAI is known to exhibit \u2018stuttering\ntransmission\u2019 in humans, with a relatively high mortality rates\n(>50%), but to-date has not acquired efficient human-to-human\ntransmission. This high mortality rate together with its pathological\nsimilarities to the 1918 H1N1 \u2018Spanish Flu\u2019 make it an\nimportant model to study and prevent future lethal pandemics. On the other hand,\nthe more recent seasonal and pandemic H1N1 strains are considered to have lower\npathogenicity, rarely causing severe disease or death. Since its emergence,\npandemic H1N1 has been found to recur in the human population as a seasonal\ninfluenza. H1N1 influenza isolates used in these studies include recent pandemic\nstrains, previous seasonal strains, and a reconstructed 1918 strain.",

Individual or group mouse body\nweights were collected on a daily basis to monitor the disease course, and mice\nwere humanely euthanized upon reaching the experimental endpoint (i.e. sample\ncollection or severe clinical symptoms). Weight loss significance was determined\nby Student\u2019s t test (Microsoft Excel), and\nsignificance in survival data was determined by the Mantel-Cox test (GraphPad).\nBoth viral titers and qPCR assays were used to confirm the infection status of\nall mice (see below).

A NET average and standard deviation are assigned to each identified\npeptide if the same peptide is observed in multiple analyses. Both calculated\nmonoisotopic masses and observed NETs of identified peptides were included in\nthe AMT tag database. From the primary data records corresponding to the data\nused to generate the AMT tag database (PASS00416 and PASS00417), the user can\ndownload the raw data, the assembled database, and parameter files necessary to\nrecreate the AMT-tag approach. In addition to the data files, a detailed\ntutorial has been made available for download.

Combining and\ncontrasting results from different studies is often referred to as\nmeta-analysis. One of the goals behind making these datasets freely available\nthrough public database resources like GEO, ViPR and IRD is to support their\nincorporation into meta-analysis approaches that include new experiments being\nperformed by the research community. To facilitate this kind of meta-analysis,\nconsiderable effort has been dedicated to providing complete descriptions of all\nexperimental and data analysis methodologies, combined with structured,\nstandardized metadata describing selected key aspects of the experiment design,\nespecially regarding the experiment factors that serve as the independent\n(manipulated) variables in the study in ViPR and IRD. Clear representations of\nthe experiment metadata will make it relatively simple to appropriately combine\nthese primary and derived results with data from future related experiments for\nmeta-analysis.",

Many\nbioinformatics data processing workflows currently implement a \u2018one\nsize fits all\u2019 approach with a single algorithm being applied to all\ndatasets without regard for the specific nuances of each individual dataset. The\nproblem with this approach is that the processing algorithms and parameters that\nare ideal for one dataset may not be optimal for other\ndatasets\u2014especially when dealing with different experimental\nsystems. Hence, processing of the data using a single universally-applied\nalgorithm may not sufficiently address the individual requirements of each\ndataset. To truly solve this underlying problem, an analytical workflow that\nexplores the relevant parameter space for a diverse set of algorithms would need\nto be implemented. This approach would provide an objective and automated\nprocess to intelligently \u2018choose\u2019 the optimal\ncombination of parameters and algorithms that produce the best set of results\nfor each individual dataset. Such an approach could be implemented in analytical\nworkflow suites like Galaxy or GenePattern57,58 to\nobjectively and confidently reprocess the raw data from each\n\u2018-omics\u2019 dataset in a data-driven fashion to further\nimprove the quality of the derived data.
