It has noted global circulation of H1N1, H3N2, and two lineages of type B (Victoria- and Yamagata-) viruses that cause 670,000 annual deaths worldwide [1]. In the past few years, human infections with several subtypes of avian influenza virus (AIV) (e.g., H5 and H7) occurred sporadically [2]. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H5N6 viruses have infected 878 humans with 53% mortality since 1997 [3]. Since the first case of human infection with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 virus reported in China in 2013, the number of humans infected with this virus has dramatically increased to more than 1,567 as of April 2019 [4]. Recognizing this public concern, it is important to distinguish seasonal influenza and avian influenza viruses such as H5 and H7N9 that occur simultaneously in humans, especially in China.",

Thus, rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections is important for mitigating the spread of virus within a community, facilitating immediate treatment with NAIs, and controlling carriers of these pathogens. Methods to detect and identify influenza viruses have improved over the past decades, ranging from traditional virus culture [6] to introduction of serological and molecular diagnostic technology (e.g., real-time RT-PCR [7] and PCR [8]) and more recently, rapid influenza detection tests (RIDT) [9\u201311]. With various influenza-specific diagnostic tools, selecting the most appropriate approach is based on a number of factors, including sensitivity, specificity, throughput, cost, and availability [12].",

            "text": "Virus isolation and serology method has traditionally been used to detect influenza virus. However, it may take several days to obtain results [13]. RIDT is a rapid method of performing point-of-care testing (POCT) in the field. Most RIDT diagnostic kits can detect influenza nucleoprotein antigen [14]. However, RIDT has two potential limitations: i) relatively large numbers of influenza viruses must be present for accurate detection in the collected sample, and ii) inability to distinguish between influenza subtypes. Overall, sensitivity and accuracy of RIDT are lower than those of qRT-PCR-based methods that not only can amplify small amounts of target viral RNA, but also can allow for determination of influenza A virus subtype using specifically designed primers [12]. Despite qRT-PCR-based approaches have these advantages, they typically take at least a few hours up to 2 days to obtain results [15]. In addition, qRT-PCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its function in ensuring rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients. Recently, many Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived molecular tests have been approved for point-of-care use (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm). Although the detection time (similar to RIDT) and sensitivity (better than RIDT) of CLIA-waived molecular tests have been improved, they are mostly limited to seasonal flu detection. They are incapable of discriminating seasonal influenza of avian subtypes that can cause human infection [16].",

They have been used for rapid detection of specific genes [17\u201320]. In particular, LAMP method combined with reverse transcription (called RT-LAMP) is a method for simultaneously synthesizing cDNA from template RNA and amplifying DNA [21]. Thus, RT-LAMP is useful for detecting RNA viruses. In addition, polymerase enzyme produces protons and subsequently leads to decreased pH in the presence of extensive DNA polymerase activity during LAMP reaction, thus facilitating real-time and simple detection of amplicons as observed by a change from pink to yellow color in the reaction solution [22]. The specificity and sensitivity of RT-LAMP are potentially comparable to those of existing PCR-based diagnostics with much shorter reaction time. Recently, influenza diagnostics tools leveraging RT-LAMP technology have been reported [23\u201330]. However, most of these tools can only diagnose a single or a small number of human influenza viruses. Their ability to diagnose newly emerging viruses is limited. None of these methods can simultaneously differentiate infection of seasonal influenza from multiple avian influenza virus infection including recently emerging H5Nx and H7N9, although this is critical when infection by those viruses to humans simultaneously occurs.",

A/Em/Korea/W149/2006 (H5N1) and A/Em/Korea/w468/2014 (H5N8) viruses were isolated from wild bird feces in South Korea [31, 32]. Candidate vaccine strains containing Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (H5N6) and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088\u20136/2014 (H5N8) in A/Puerto Rico/8/34 were kindly provided by World Health Organization (WHO). Handling of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 viruses and H7N9 virus were conducted in an enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL-3+) facility approved by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). MERS-CoV Korean isolate (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002 _05_2015, GenBank accession no. KT029139) was kindly provided by KCDC. To determine virus infectious titers, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay was performed in MDCK cells. Each virus was individually prepared by serial 10-fold dilutions in infection medium (minimal essential medium). The prepared virus diluent was used to infect MDCK cells in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in a CO2 incubator. Supernatants were then replaced with infection medium (MEM) with 1 \u03bcg/L L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. After 2~3 days of incubation, virus titers were determined using the hemagglutination (HA) assay with 0.5% turkey or chicken red blood cells (RBCs). Then 200 \u03bcl of virus stock was used to extract viral RNA using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After extraction, RNA was stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use.",

RT-LAMP primer sets for each influenza subtype were designed using LAMP primer design software (Primer Explorer V4). Primer sets included two external primers (forward outer primer F3 and backward outer primer B3), two internal primers (forward inner primer FIP and backward inner primer BIP), and two loop primers (backward loop primer LB and forward loop primer LF) to augment the number of loops in the LAMP reaction, thus enhancing its reaction speed. Type B influenza-specific primers were designed to be specific for NA gene based on consensus sequence identified in 200 sequences of its two lineages (Victoria and Yamagata). Alternatively, influenza subtype-specific primers were designed to be specific to HA gene based on consensus sequences identified among 200 random sequences for each of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9 subtypes. All primers were synthesized by Cosmogenetech (Republic of Korea). Detailed information for all five primer sets used in this study is presented in Table 1.",

Prescribing anti-influenza drugs following rapid and accurate diagnosis of an infection is thus critical to mitigate viral spread in the early stage of an outbreak. Many primary care providers use RIDT to diagnose influenza infections because it is simple to use with relatively rapid results. However, the accuracy of this approach is lower than that of qRT-PCR. A highly accurate gene-based diagnostic assay would serve as a valuable local on-site tool if it is easy to use with rapid results. Although many CLIA-waived molecular tests satisfy these criteria due to recent advancement, most of these developed tests are limited to detect seasonal influenza without appropriate subtype discrimination. In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP method to distinctively diagnose human influenza (e.g., seasonal influenza type B, H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza viruses infecting humans (e.g., H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9). Hence, this developed method would be essential in some countries where these viruses are co-circulating in humans.

            "text": "Our multiplex RT-LAMP detection system was designed to be a more feasible RIDT with accuracy as high as RT-PCR methods for detecting most recent human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans. Although a variety of reliable and affordable RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect human or avian influenza viruses, each can only detect an individual subtype [23\u201329, 34, 35] or limited subtypes of human influenza viruses and/or avian influenza viruses infecting humans [18, 30, 36, 37]. In a pandemic, it is critical to rapidly differentiate patients infected by seasonal flu from those infected by an emerging strain. Thus, reliable and affordable multiplex detection tools should be capable of identifying broad-spectrum influenza viruses infecting humans. Moreover, RT-LAMP method for most recent emerging HPAI H5N6 and H5N8 viruses which have high potential to infect humans has rarely been developed or evaluated for its detection efficacy. In addition to broad-spectrum detection of human influenza viruses using our multiplex RT-LAMP assay, we optimized commercially available colorimetric RT-LAMP enzyme. Previous studies have also shown that the colorimetric visualization system using dyes (e.g., SYBR) is detectable by naked eyes [38]. However, these colorimetric methods require additional steps (e.g., adding dye to test for color changes after reaction or the use of a UV device for visualization [39]) that can decrease their utility in resource-limited primary care settings.",

The complex design of each specific primer sets made to amplify target sequence with high degree of sensitivity and specificity is one of major recognized constraints of this assay. Recognizing its advantages when detecting RNA genome of viral pathogens, RT-LAMP assay still requires improvement, particularly for the RNA extraction step, to be an efficient and suitable field-based diagnostic tool. Current approaches for RNA extraction of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirate specimens collected from influenza-suspected patients usually require laboratory processing equipment (e.g., use of centrifuge system and others laboratory devices), technical support, and electricity. Thus, the use of chaotropic salt extraction which does not require centrifugation [40] would improve the feasibility of the developed multiplex RT-LAMP method as it utilizes a syringe with RNA-binding filter method [41]. Furthermore, it has been reported that the RT-LAMP reaction could be performed without RNA extraction step for some RNA viruses [42]. Although our multiplex RT-LAMP assay has not been optimized to directly detect influenza viral RNA without RNA sample preparation, it would significantly increase its feasibility as a diagnostic tool for POCT.",
