HCV replication cycle takes place into the cytoplasmic compartment of hepatocyte, and it causes acute or chronic hepatitis. The persistent HCV infection is clinically characterized by lifelong low-level virus production, and it is accompanied by the development of chronic liver infection (in about 80% of infected patients) that can evolve to steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in a small percentage (about 20%) of chronically infected patients it can develop to the end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma [2].",

            "text": "Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the HCV-related liver injury are not fully understood, redox alterations of hepatocytes have been extensively described in several chronic liver diseases [3, 4]. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and their clearance by scavenging molecules, has been recognized as a leading factor in inducing hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrogenesis, which are responsible for induction and perpetuation of liver damage [5]. Several authors report a rise of ROS levels during HCV infection [6\u201313], and various viral proteins are known to induce and/or augment the ROS production, including HCV core, E1, E2, nonstructural (NS) 3, NS4B, and NS5A [11, 14\u201317]. Moreover, the simultaneous induction of several ROS-producing pathways and enzymes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductases [15, 18] and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases (NOXs) [15, 16, 19], also contributes to HCV-induced oxidative stress. On the contrary, other studies report an increase in the antioxidant defenses, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity, and GSH levels [14, 20\u201323]. Glutathione is an important radical scavenger that directly and indirectly neutralizes a variety of reactive molecules, such as superoxide anions (O2\u00b7\u2212), hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [24]. The ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) form of GSH is considered an important indicator of the antioxidant capacity of the cell. Conflicting results are shown about the effect of HCV on intracellular GSH metabolism [17, 19, 23, 25\u201327]. Indeed, Roe and collaborators [27] report a significant raise of GSSG in HCV-infected cells, while increased GSH concentration has been demonstrated by de Mochel et al. [19] using the same in vitro infection system. Interestingly, Abdalla et al. [20] describe the different effects of two viral proteins on cell antioxidant defenses. In fact, hepatocytes overexpressing HCV core protein have reduced GSH levels and increased the oxidation of thioredoxin (Trx), while the overexpression of viral NS5A protein (known for its ability to cause oxidative stress) [16] increases antioxidant enzymes (MnSOD and catalase), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and GSH content. Finally, patients with chronic hepatitis C show a depletion of GSH content, which increases after antioxidant treatment [28]. However, different genotypes of HCV exhibit different abilities to induce oxidative stress [29]. In fact, in patients chronically infected with genotype 1a/b, a sharp decrease of reduced GSH level has been observed with respect to the other genotypes, suggesting the more serious disease associated with this genotype [29].",

On the other hand, HCV core impairs the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway by inducing the translocation of sMaf proteins in the cytoplasm, where they bind to NS3 as part of the replication complex. As a result, Nrf2 is trapped in the cytoplasm and is unable to function as transcription factor [26, 30].",

Conversely, during the chronic phase of infection, low level of both HCV replication and apoptosis was observed, ROS production returned to basal level, GSH content was reestablished, and the GSH/GSSG ratio shifted versus the reduced form of GSH. Moreover, the treatment of HCV-chronically infected cells with a prooxidant drug, auranofin, was able to reactivate viral replication.",

During the first two passages (8 days postinfection), about 80% of the cells were stained for HCV core protein, thus indicating a high rate of HCV replication corresponding to the \u201cacute\u201d phase of infection (Figure 1(a) left side). On the contrary, in the late stage of infection (76 days postinfection p.i.), here referred as the \u201cchronic\u201d phase, only about 15% of the cells expressed the core protein (Figure 1(a) right side). Similarly, the HCV RNA in intracellular compartment reached the highest titer (3.59 \u00d7 107 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d7 106 copies/\u03bcg total RNA \u2217\u2217\u2217P < 0.001 vs. p0) 8 days p.i., and it decreased after the recovery phase of the cell culture and during the chronic phase (2.09 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 106/\u03bcg total RNA at 44 days p.i and 6 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 9 \u00d7 102 copies/\u03bcg total RNA at 76 days p.i.) (Figure 1(b)) that is consistent with a persistently infected cell culture. Furthermore, in correspondence with the maximum titer of HCV RNA, the number of HCV-infected cells was significantly reduced compared to uninfected ones (Figure 1(c)). In fact, trypan blue dye exclusion assay showed a significant decrease of alive cells during the so-called \u201ccrisis\u201d phase that lasted about two weeks during which the infected cultures were not splitted. Particularly, on days 8 and 14 most of the cells became rounded, detached from the plate, and floated in the culture medium (data not shown). Furthermore, FACS analysis of annexin V/PI double staining of cells showed that infected cells underwent apoptotic death only during the crisis phase. In fact, as shown in Figure 1(d) (right panel), the percentage of double-stained PI+/AV+ cells increased with respect to uninfected cells (CTR) at passage 2 (p2). The 5-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (obtained as mean from 4 independent experiments) was detected in infected cultures at 14 days p.i., compared to the uninfected ones (Figure 1(d), right panel). Interestingly, apoptotic death in infected cell cultures coincided with the highest intracellular viral RNA titer (Figure 1(b)), thus suggesting a causative link between the rate of HCV replication and cell death. Subsequently to the crisis phase, cells started a recovery phase at the end of which the number of live cells, in HCV-infected cultures, was comparable to that of control cells (Figure 1(c); see value at p4). Accordingly, FACS analysis demonstrated that from 37 days p.i. up to 76 days p.i., the percentage of apoptotic cells returned to control values upon recovery of the cultures (Figure 1(d) right panel; see values at p4, p6, p13, and p18). Moreover, from this time point up to 76 days p.i. (chronic phase), the percentage of HCV core-positive cells decreased to 15% (Figure 1(a) right panel) vs. 80% of the acute phase, thus mirroring viral titer trend (see Figure 1(b)). These results strongly suggested a steady state level of HCV replication.",

As shown in Figure 2(a), a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels (more than 3 times higher compared to control) was detected in infected cells 8 days p.i.

            "text": "Oxidative stress has emerged as a key contributor to the development and progression of HCV-induced pathogenesis of liver [34, 35, 42] and the associated development of hepatocellular carcinoma [43]. The lack of an in vitro system that recapitulates the different stages of HCV chronic infection has hampered the disclosure of the exact mechanisms and the mutual effect of HCV infection and oxidative stress pathways on the host cells. In this study, we were able to set up the HCV infectious system in Huh7.5 cells, which are permissive to the JFH1 infectious clone [31]. Particularly, infection of cell monolayers with low m.o.i. of HCV allowed to obtain first an acute infection and subsequently the establishment of a persistent infection. We demonstrated that, during the acute phase, high percentage of infected cells underwent apoptosis and viral titer peaked, whereas during the chronic phase viral replication was reduced and consequently the percentage of apoptotic-infected cells. This model called \u201clong-term infected cultures\u201d (LTIC) could mimic the same stages of a natural HCV infection. It is interesting that HCV has long been believed noncytopathic virus, and the hepatocyte damage during infection was considered to be mediated by the immune system. However, consistent with previously reported results [44], we could demonstrate that HCV induces cell death during in vitro infection of Huh7.5 cells in the absence of RIG-I-mediated innate immune response. The presence of low number of core expressing cells, during the here called \u201cchronic phase\u201d, paralleled by the low level viral RNA titer, indicated the ability of the JFH1 clone of HCV to persistently infect susceptible cell cultures. With regard to the mechanisms involved in establishing in vitro persistence, there could be a close virus-host cell interaction, and as reported by Zhong et al. [44], in Huh7.5 cells long-term infected by HCV, some cells resistant to reinfection, due to the loss of HCV receptor CD81, can be selected during the chronic phase. From the virus side, HCV is known to exist as quasispecies in patients in vivo, and during persistent infection in vitro, some virus variants can arise that are more adapted in cultures and able to persist without killing the host cells or having reduced infectivity [44]. These points will deserve deeper investigation in the future.",

NOXs are a family of seven enzymes, generating O2\u00b7\u2212 or H2O2 from molecular oxygen [45]. Accumulating evidence indicates that NOX-mediated ROS production has a critical role in hepatic fibrosis [46, 47], and in particular, NOX4 is involved in the severity of HCV-associated liver disease [19, 36], as well as in the regulation of viral replication of different viruses [48\u201350]. Here, we found that NOX4 and NOX1 rise mirrored the trend of ROS production and that of viral replication; in fact, their expression was increased during the acute phase of infection, while it decreased late in infection, thus suggesting a critical role for NOXs also in regulating HCV replication cycle. The reason why both NOX enzymes were downmodulated in infected cells during the chronic phase is still unclear, but we hypothesize that it could be a further mechanism induced by the virus to maintain reducing environment into host cell for the establishment of its persistence. Indeed, other viruses are able at the same time to positively and negatively modulate NOX isoforms to their advantage [48\u201350]. Further studies will be needed to clarify this aspect.",

Here, we found that intracellular GSH levels were significantly decreased in infected cells during the acute phase, while those of GSSG were increased, and, consequently, the ratio GSH/GSSG shifted toward GSSG, thus reflecting an impaired antioxidant potential. The oxidized environment seems to be necessary for HCV to replicate as demonstrated by viral titer peak in the acute phase. These data are in line with different in vitro studies on viruses responsible for acute infection, demonstrating the role of virus-induced oxidative stress in promoting viral replication [48, 50, 58\u201360]. On the contrary, during the chronic phase, reducing redox environment was restored by increased GSH content in infected cells that might be useful for the establishment of viral persistence. Indeed, treatment of persistently HCV-infected cells with the prooxidant drug auranofin caused the reactivation of HCV replication.

It has been recently demonstrated that higher expression of nuclear Nrf2 contributes to persistent HCV infection and that knockdown of Nrf2 suppresses its persistent infection [62]. The authors suggest that the nuclear translocation of p-Nrf2 might play an important role in the expression of the genes which contribute to regulate apoptosis and HCV persistence [25, 26, 30, 62]. Accordingly, we found higher mRNA levels of GCL and GS enzymes during the recovery period; at the same time, Nrf2 protein content was highly expressed during the chronic phase.
