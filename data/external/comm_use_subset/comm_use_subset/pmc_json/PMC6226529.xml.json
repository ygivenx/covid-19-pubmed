In the elderly population it has been estimated that numbers of hospitalization due to RSV infection may reach close to the numbers of respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses1\u20133. In mice, RSV has been shown to cause more lung pathology at old age, but the different mechanisms comprising the response to infection that are influenced by aging of the lung tissue largely remain to be defined. Studies on the full transcriptome in young adult mice have shown that the response to RSV at the site of infection is complex as it involves many different biological pathways4,5. Altered antiviral expression of some genes in lung due to aging6,7 and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases indicate the involvement of unique age-related features that should be considered towards understanding disease at old age. However, effects of aging on the full RSV-induced transcription profile in lungs have remained elusive. In our study, we determined the full transcription profile in the lungs during infection with RSV to provide a more comprehensive exploration of the consequences of old age on gene expression.",

Infection due to this lack of acquired RSV-specific immunity implies a prominent role for direct innate anti-viral immune mechanisms that are activated in infected tissue in order to control the virus. A prominent role for innate responses has been exemplified by a study that shows genetic susceptibility to RSV-induced bronchiolitis in children being predominantly associated with innate immune genes12. Moreover, these innate genes comprise pro-inflammatory genes, indicating a prominent role for inflammatory conditions in susceptibility to disease by RSV-infection12. Hence, innate immune responses to RSV do not only control the infection but can also induce inflammation that contributes to pathology and is associated with RSV bronchiolitis7,12. The importance of the acute responses of the innate immune compartment in disease is also underscored by studies in blood of RSV-challenged human adults. These showed that many of the genes that discriminate symptomatic individuals from asymptomatic individuals are involved in innate and acute immune responses induced by viruses13,14. Altogether, these findings suggest an important role for the acute anti-viral response and its resulting inflammation during RSV infection at old age.",

These observations with respect to RSV are in line with the general view that many of the innate responses that participate in defeating pathogens become dysfunctional at old age15,16. Paradoxically, although inflammatory responses that are induced via these innate immune mechanisms may be compromised at old age, aging is accompanied by chronically increased levels of markers of inflammation, a phenomenon that is known as inflammaging17. Such chronic inflammation at old age has been observed in lungs of mice in the absence of specified pathogens18.

These data indicate that aging leads to elevated expression of immunological activity in lungs, and downregulation of genes involved in constitution of the extracellular matrix of lung tissue prior to infection.",

Among the downregulated genes, we found one gene involved in matrix (Angptl4) and two genes with immune functions (Nr4a3, Rgcc).

Moreover, expressions of a set of genes involved in immune functions that are induced in response to RSV at young age were significantly elevated at old age (Cxcl9, Cfb, C4b, Cybb, Gata3).

This analysis showed that the expression profile induced by RSV infection in the lungs showed most resemblance with the same five diseases in young and old mice. Among these biological disorders, we found RSV-unrelated diseases like gastrointestinal disease, endocrine system disorders, and metabolic disorders. However, even in the absence of an RSV infection we found that aging enriched for some of these diseases that were enriched for in response to RSV, i.e. organismal injury (136 genes), immunological disease (55 molecules), and metabolic disease (49 genes). In addition, the transcriptomic profile of aging in lung tissue resembled processes involved in cancer (134 genes) and haematological disease (55 genes).

Our findings show that aging shapes alteration of the expression of unique sets of genes in lung tissue in both steady state and during a response to infection with RSV. Prior to challenge with virus, aged lungs showed reduced expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix function and showed differential expression of genes indicative of uncontrolled elevation of immunological activity and injury, cancer, immunological disease and metabolic disease. Moreover, the first line of defence in RSV-infected lungs controls the virus less effectively at old age, whereas RSV appeared to induce excessive immune responses by the antiviral type-I IFN pathways in aged lungs. Alternatively, although RSV-induced interferon responses were higher at old age and some of the elevated immune activities at old age prior to infection are part of the anti-viral response, these immune mediators could not effectively control RSV. These findings indicate that aging may interfere with the immune homeostatic regulation in a way that leaves the immune system refractory to RSV and prohibits clearing of virus. Towards development of preventive and therapeutic interventions, this warrants directing the focus of further research on susceptibility to infectious respiratory diseases at old age to the role of dysregulated inflammation in viral pathogenesis and the role of altered extracellular matrix functions in susceptibility to infection and the physics of lung disease during infection.",

By analysing the full transcriptome, we found many other immune-relate genes and also many non-immune genes can be added to the spectrum of gene expressions impacted by aging, both under steady state conditions and upon inoculation with RSV. A substantial number of the genes we found being expressed at lower levels at old age are involved in constituting or remodelling of the extracellular matrix, such as genes encoding collagens and periostin (Postn). Moreover, our analyses indicated enrichment of gene expression changes resembling injury in the aged lungs under homeostasis. Collagens sustain the functional architecture of healthy lung tissue as they provide a major constituent of the extracellular matrix scaffold on which cells in the lung tissue perform their functions and which impacts the mechanical forces involved in breathing25. Periostin is involved in airway remodelling as it promotes wound repair by epithelial cells and it can also induce collagen I and III gene expression26. The matrix scaffolds the epithelial cells that are targeted by RSV and provides the environment needed by immune cells and antiviral molecules to optimally migrate in the infected lungs. Moreover, remodelling of the extracellular matrix is needed for the physical constitution needed to breathe optimally and to provide an optimal barrier function preventing entry of pathogens. When the walls of alveoli are destroyed, the air sacs coalesce, which results in airflow obstruction25 as found in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)27. Aging impacts the breathing capacity of lungs and the morphology and elasticity of the lungs28\u201331, but most studies on aging of lung tissue address defective matrix functions in the context of non-infectious diseases such as COPD. The need of the extracellular matrix for immune cells to locally control infection and the effect of physical obstructions caused by RSV that may add to the reduced respiratory capacity in aged lungs are often neglected in studies on aging-related infectious diseases of the lung tissue. Downregulated matrix remodelling was a major part of all aging-regulated changes of gene expression and therefore indicates that, in addition to altered immune responsiveness, a dysfunctional matrix may have a major impact on setting the stage for increased susceptibility to disease by infection at old age. We cannot exclude that the downregulation of matrix genes may actually be an underestimation due to transcripts being diluted by genes expressed by cells of the immune system invading the lungs at old age18,32. Nonetheless, our data warrant more detailed studies on the role of dysfunctional remodelling of the lung matrix contributing to susceptibility to aging-related respiratory disease in the context of pathogenic infections.",

Indeed, in lavages of human bronchia elevated levels of IgA and IgM have been found at old age indicating increase of antibody producing cells in the lungs by aging29. This may be due to accumulation of memory B cells residing in lung tissue upon infections33 experienced over the years. Another explanation may be found in the increased immune activity represented in a set of genes in our study and found by others in elevated numbers of pulmonary lymphocytes at old age and in low-grade chronic inflammation, known as inflammaging18,29,34. These conditions are likely to attract immune cells into the aged lung tissue. Moreover, our analyses suggested downregulation of immunosuppressive upstream mechanisms associated with molecules like TGFB1, glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 and Dexamethasone. This finding indicates defective responsiveness to anti-inflammatory pathways that are naturally exerted by our immune system to prevent immune-mediated diseases may be responsible for the elevated activation status of immune cells in aged lung tissue. Since inflammatory conditions are involved in many aging-related diseases and frailty, it would be interesting to find out in future research to what extent inflammaging of the lung tissue may contribute to aging-related susceptibility to respiratory infections. Understanding of how elevated immune activities in lung tissue may contribute to dysfunctions and disease will provide targets that can be used to design treatments and preventive measures other than vaccines alone.",

Many genes of these pathways were even expressed to a higher level than in RSV-inoculated lungs at young age. Type I interferons are key to the direct innate response to a viral infection that is required to prevent further infection and spread of viruses. Since old mice less effectively control the viral burden while they highly expressed genes involved in anti-viral interferon pathways, our findings indicate that the anti-viral interferon pathways at old age may function less effectively and may be enhanced by higher viral loads due to dysfunctions in other anti-viral functionalities at old age. Additional analyses by Ingenuity of prediction of upstream regulators indicated defective natural downregulation of STAT3 upon RSV infection at old age (Supplemental Table S2). Since STAT3 has been shown to negatively regulate the inflammatory properties of type I IFNs35, suggesting that inadequate control of the interferon pathway leads to abundant activation of interferon pathways by infections at old age. Alternatively, dysregulation of the interferon pathways by aging may also be found in the very early kinetics of response to virus. Several studies have shown that innate immune cells from lung mount a slower innate interferon response to virus within the first hours upon encounter of virus. Our analyses and studies by others focused on later time-points during responsiveness in the infected airways, but future research on the age dynamics of the interferon pathways in situ should clarify on this age-related phenomenon of the dynamics during the first day of a viral challenge. In addition to direct anti-viral functions, activation of the innate interferon pathways have been shown to induce inflammation that may harm the lung tissue36. This leads to suggest that exaggerated induction of interferon pathways by uncontrolled virus may drive inflammation that causes enhanced pathogenesis during an infection at old age. Studies have shown that anti-inflammatory treatment during RSV infection can prevent pathology even though these anti-inflammatory modulators diminish control of viral replication7. Altogether, these findings warrant thorough studies on dysregulation of the balance between anti-viral versus pro-inflammatory functions of interferons in disease by pulmonary infections at old age. Moreover, improving the use of anti-inflammatory interventions may be promising and gain focus over just the induction of stronger adaptive immune responses in the context of vaccination.",

Among these we found a set of chemokines like CXCL10 and CCL8 that regulate migration of immune cells in tissue and molecules such as FCGR1 and MHC-related genes that confer antigen processing and presentation to orchestrate specific immunity by adaptive immune cells. These processes have indeed been reported to be impaired at old age.

            "text": "Notably, we found in lungs that aging induces expression of a set of genes that are expressed at young age only upon infection with RSV. Many of these have relevant functions in the immune system and suggest an antiviral immune status partly being active chronically, and maybe in a way that makes the immune system refractory to RSV. Expression of CXCL9, also known as MIG, a chemokine that attracts T cells and NK cells via the ligand CXCR341, may explain the chronically elevated level of these cells in aged lungs reported by others. Expression of CYB\u03b2, a microbicidal protein that is part of the oxidase system of phagocytes42, also indicates elevated antimicrobial activity in lungs at old age. Elevated GATA3 we found in old animals may indicate enhanced activity by type 2 T-cell responses and allergy-like lung inflammation, since GATA3 is a transcription factor that is expressed by Th2 cells and Type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and promotes susceptibility to allergy-like inflammation associated with Th2 responses43\u201346. However, Ingenuity analyses predicted downregulation of Th2-inducers or inhibition of responsiveness to these inducers (IL-4 and VEGF47) and therefore suggests regulation of GATA3-mediated effects other than mere propagation of Th2 functions45. CFB and C4b are molecules of the alternative complement pathway and known to be produced in large amounts in the liver. Finding complement expression in aged lungs and upon RSV infection indicates that the liver may not be the sole and major organ for producing complement under some settings. These findings suggest that aging induces biological alterations in functions of the immune system that all would be induced at young age only by exogenous pathogens like RSV. Whether this is a result of dysfunctional immune regulation at old age that may contribute to susceptibility or, alternatively, maybe a requirement for needed enhancement of immune patrol to retain sufficient immunity at old age remains to be defined.",

One important consideration for future studies is the notion that RSV may infect alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells at different rates, but may also infect immune cells like alveolar macrophages49,50. Both the cellular composition of the lungs and the functionality of different cell subsets may be subject to aging51,52. Therefore, future studies should reveal which of the different types among the alveolar cells contribute most to aging-related effects we found and how molecular pathways we found to be affected by aging may mechanistically interact in these alveolar cell types. For example, mechanistic in vitro studies with alveolar type II epithelial cells have shown that TGF-\u03b2 promotes differentiation of these cells from type II into type I cells53. Ingenuity analyses of our data indicated hampered TGF-\u03b2 signalling at old age, suggesting that hampered TGF-\u03b2 signalling may contribute to reduced transdifferentiation of alveolar cells in lungs and hence lead to altered ratio of alveolar type I and type II pneumocytes at old age. Moreover, it would be interesting to define the impact of RSV, or selected proteins derived from the virus, on regulation of inflammatory genes and extracellular matrix genes. Such future approaches based on findings like ours will open a new era in research on the impact of aging on susceptibility to RSV.",

At day 2 and 5 after inoculation, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine, bled and sacrificed to collect lungs. Lungs were perfused with PBS to eliminate blood cells prior to collection of the tissue, immersed in RNAlater RNA stabilization agent (Ambion) and subsequently stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. RNA was extracted from homogenized lung tissue using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Probes were considered differentially expressed if they met the following two criteria for at least one of the above comparisons: (i) a p-value < 0.001 (determined by ANOVA), which for this study corresponds to a False discovery rate (FDR) < 5% when accounting for multiple testing; and (ii) an absolute fold change > 1.5 (up- or down-regulated). If multiple probes corresponding to the same gene were significant, their data were averaged to remove redundancy in further analyses. Fold changes were calculated as the average gene expression levels of three mice per group compared to the respective control group. Variation within groups was expressed as relative standard deviation (also known as the coefficient of variation) and calculated as the square root of the average variance across the expression data per gene within each group.
