Initial stages of inflammation that exacerbate tissue damage are often followed by subsequent regeneration/repair of tissue to restore its function (Medzhitov, 2008). Failure to progress to these later stages contributes to development of chronic pathologic conditions associated with numerous human diseases including pancreatitis and hepatitis, arthritis, and neurodegenerative syndromes. Despite the enormous medical significance of persistent inflammation, the mechanisms that restrain the tissue damage and ensure the transition to the restorative phase largely remain to be understood (Nathan ' Ding, 2010).",

Cytokines that belong to the family of type 1 interferons (IFN) protect the host against viruses and tumors (Stark et al, 1998). IFN act on cells through engaging a cell surface-located cognate receptor (formed by IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains) and subsequent stimulation of the signal transduction cascade including activation of the Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT1/2) proteins (Uze et al, 2007). The latter interact with IRF9 to form a specific transcriptionally active complex capable of inducing a plethora of IFN-stimulated proteins that act in concert to mediate the anti-viral, anti-tumorigenic and immunomodulatory effects of IFNs. These effects underlie the use of pharmacologically formulated IFN for treatment of viral infections, cancers and multiple sclerosis (Stark et al, 1998; Platanias, 2005; Stark ' Darnell, 2012).",

            "text": "However, the benefits of IFN actions to the host are offset by tissue toxicities elicited by these cytokines (Trinchieri, 2010). Importantly, while anti-viral effects of IFN action could be achieved at low concentrations, a higher dose is required to achieve the anti-proliferative and anti-survival effects of IFN on tumor and benign cells (Jaitin et al, 2006). Furthermore, the toxic effects of IFN correlate with its affinity for IFNAR1 (Jaitin et al, 2006; Kalie et al, 2007; Thomas et al, 2011; de Weerd et al, 2013) and require a much higher cell surface density of its receptor (Moraga et al, 2009; Levin et al, 2011; Piehler et al, 2012). The cell surface levels of IFN receptor and ensuing sensitivity of cells to IFN are negatively regulated by the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of IFNAR1 facilitated by the \u03b2-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase (Kumar et al, 2003, 2007). The ability of \u03b2-Trcp to interact with IFNAR1 and to ubiquitinate this protein requires phosphorylation on specific serine residues (Ser526 in mouse IFNAR1 or Ser535 in human receptor) within a conserved degron motif located in the intracellular domain of IFNAR1 (Kumar et al, 2003, 2004).",

            "text": "This IFNAR1 phosphorylation triggered by IFN (Kumar et al, 2004; Marijanovic et al, 2006) through JAK-mediated activation of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) attenuates IFN signaling by ubiquitination-driven downregulation and degradation of IFNAR1 (Zheng et al, 2011a,c2011c). Importantly, this phosphorylation of IFNAR1 can be induced by ligand-unrelated stimuli that altogether desensitize cells to IFN (reviewed in (Fuchs, 2013). For example, PKD2-activating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can trigger ubiquitination and downregulation of IFNAR1 and blunt the cellular responses to IFN (Zheng et al, 2011b). Other stimuli capable of IFN-independent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 utilize a different pathway (Liu et al, 2008, 2009b) that involves IFNAR1 Ser526/535 phosphorylation by casein kinase 1\u03b1 (Liu et al, 2009a) amplified by an adjacent priming phosphorylation (Bhattacharya et al, 2010), which is mediated by the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (Bhattacharya et al, 2011). These stimuli include inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 (Huangfu et al, 2012)], and bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS, (Qian et al, 2011)].",

Should this regulation occur in vivo, it might pose a medical problem of reduced efficacy of pharmaceutical IFN in inflamed tissues.

We initially focused on the role of IFN signaling and IFNAR1 stability in development of acute pancreatitis, a deadly disease affecting millions of people worldwide [reviewed in (Pandol, 2006)]. Whereas the etiology of this disease is complex, common pathogenetic mechanisms include food/alcohol-induced pancreatic hyperstimulation and pancreatic duct obstruction leading to increased pancreatic duct pressure and reflux of active trypsin. As a result, trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes become activated within pancreatic acinar cells resulting in their autolysis and induction of local inflammation [reviewed in (Pandol, 2006; Reichert ' Rustgi, 2011)]. Intriguingly, pancreatitis induces many pathways known to downregulate IFNAR1 such as VEGF (Kuehn et al, 1999), unfolded protein response (Kubisch ' Logsdon, 2007), and pathogen recognition receptors (Pastor et al, 2004; Li et al, 2005). Furthermore, a number of reported cases of iatrogenic pancreatitis have been attributed to the IFN-based drugs (Trivedi ' Pitchumoni, 2005), and IFN-induced pancreatic inflammation was observed in mice injected with poly I:C (Hayashi et al, 2011).",

Injection of LPS decreased the cell surface IFNAR1 protein levels in leukocytes from wild type but not Ifnar1SA mice (Fig 2A). Given that mRNA levels of Ifnar1 were not dramatically affected (Fig 2B), this result suggests that either inflammation-induced downregulation of IFNAR1 in vivo is ubiquitination-dependent or Ifnar1SA mice do not efficiently produce inflammatory cytokines or IFN in response to LPS. Contrary to the latter hypothesis, much higher levels of IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL6 and IFN\u03b2 were detected in plasma from Ifnar1SA than from wild type animals treated with LPS (Fig 2C, Supplementary Fig 9).

We first focused on a balance between inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL10). Noticeably higher TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels were found in pancreatic tissues from Ifnar1SA mice than in their wild type counterparts (Fig 3A). In addition, the pancreatitis-induced increase in blood plasma TNF\u03b1 levels were also greater in Ifnar1SA (7.89 fold) than in Ifnar1+/+ (4.50-fold) mice. Levels of IL10 protein in blood plasma were higher in caerulein-treated Ifnar1SA animals (251 \u00b1 2 versus 114 \u00b1 2 pg/ml in wild type mice) indicative of systemic anti-inflammatory response and consistent with reported increase of this cytokine in caerulein-treated mice (Zhou et al, 2012) and documented ability of IFN to induce IL10 production in leukocytes in vitro (Aman et al, 1996; Rudick et al, 1996). However, unexpectedly low IL10 mRNA levels were found in the pancreatic tissues from Ifnar1SA animals (Fig 3A). This result suggests that downregulation of IFNAR1 in cells localized in the focus of inflammation restrains production of inflammatory TNF\u03b1 while promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory IL10.",

An even greater increase in pancreatic inflammation and damage was observed in Ifnar1SA mice receiving multiple injections of caerulein to model chronic pancreatits (Fig 4A\u2013D and Supplementary Fig 12). Unlike wild type mice that displayed both signs of inflammation (including edema and leukocytic infiltration) and restored tissue (Fig 4B), pancreata from Ifnar1SA animals remained highly inflamed (Fig 4B,D and Supplementary Fig 12) and exhibited pronounced signs of tissue damage, degeneration and fibrosis (Fig 4B\u2013D).

Remarkably, in both of these models we observed a robust induction of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation of this protein (but not mRNA) in liver tissues from wild type but not Ifnar1SA mice (Fig 5A, Supplementary Fig 13).

In parallel, the severity of hepatic inflammation was prominently greater in Ifnar1SA mice compared to the wild type animals as judged by increased release of liver aminotransferases from hepatocytes into the bloodstream (serum AST and ALT, Fig 5B).",

We initially compared the severity of acute pancreatitis in Ifnar1SA animals that received BMT from either mice of the same genotype or from wild type animals. The latter chimeric mice challenged with caerulein exhibited a lesser increase in the levels of serum amylase activity (Fig 6A, blue bars v. red bars).

As expected, this effect was not seen in Ifnar1SA animals whose receptor contains the alanine residue in this position. Importantly, wild type but not Ifnar1SA tissues exhibited an increase in ubiquitination of IFNAR1 (Fig 7A). Furthermore, injection of wild type mice with LPA led to a noticeable downregulation of IFNAR1 protein (but not mRNA) on splenocytes (Fig 7B) and attenuated the sensitivity of these cells to IFN in vitro as assessed by IFN-induced activation of STAT1 (Fig 7C). Importantly, neither of these events was observed in Ifnar1SA tissues (Fig 7B,C). These data indicate that LPA can be utilized to trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation and to attenuate IFN signaling in vivo. Moreover, the Ifnar1SA mice deficient in IFNAR1 ubiquitination yet competent in LPA-induced activation of PKD2 and p38 kinases (Fig 7A) serve as a critical control that allows to distinguish the role of LPA-induced IFNAR1 elimination from IFNAR1-independent pleiotropic effects of LPA.",

A greater extent of APAP-induced liver damage (assessed by the plasma aminotransferase levels) was detected in Ifnar1SA mice compared to wild type animals.

While toxicity of LPS was attenuated upon genetic ablation of Ifnar1 (Karaghiosoff et al, 2003), it remains unclear whether induction of IFNAR1 ubiquitination in wild type animals might function as a mechanism for reducing the LPS toxicity or/and a target for protective effects of LPA. While conducting the experiments on LPS-induced cytokines (Fig 2) we were unable to compare the levels of these cytokines between wild type and Ifnar1SA mice past 24 h after LPS treatment because of early lethality in the Ifnar1SA group. This lethality was likely associated with a strikingly greater extent of lung injury including pronounced leukocyte infiltration of the interstitial and alveolar spaces, edema and alveolar distortion observed within 12 h after LPS injection (Fig 7E). Remarkably, a detailed analysis of survival revealed a significant protective effect of LPA treatment in wild type but not in Ifnar1SA mice (Fig 7F). These results indicate that ubiquitination of IFNAR1 is an intrinsic mechanism that plays a critical role in preventing the fulminant course of LPS-induced septic shock. Furthermore, collectively these data provide a proof of principle for pharmacological stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination as an effective strategy against acute local and generalized inflammatory syndromes.",

Striking systemic and local phenotypes observed in Ifnar1SA mice under etiologically and pathogenetically diverse types of inflammatory syndromes illustrate two important points. First, the results suggest that accelerated ubiquitination and ensuing downregulation of IFNAR1 in response to numerous stimuli may (at least to some extent) functionally mimic the complete loss of this receptor via genetic ablation. Under specific physiologic and pathologic scenarios, this accelerated degradation may result in a phenotypic equivalency between wild type and IFNAR1 knockout animals. Such equivalency should not be over-interpreted as the lack of role of IFN in a given physiologic process or a pathologic condition.",

Temporarily limiting the output of IFN signaling is expected to attenuate the direct detrimental effects of IFN on cell growth and viability and affect IFN-induced p38-dependent (Katsoulidis et al, 2005) and NF-\u03baB-regulated (Du et al, 2007) inflammatory pathways known to contribute to expression of additional inflammatory cytokines (Karin, 2005). Furthermore, previously published studies showed that IFNAR1 expression is essential for efficient IL6 signaling (Mitani et al, 2001). The produced cytokines/chemokines either directly kill cells or contribute to subsequent waves of recruitment of immune cells that are capable of further damaging the inflamed tissue. Pancreatic inflammation in mice deficient in IFNAR1 ubiquitination was paralleled with an altered balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF\u03b1 and IL10) and increased expression of CCL2 (Fig 3). Given that IFN directly induces transcription of CCL2 (Buttmann et al, 2007) that mediates recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, which in turn produce TNF\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines (Guha ' Mackman, 2001), it is plausible that down-regulation of IFNAR1 may help to restrict this pathway. Consistent with this possibility, a greater number of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages was observed in tissues from Ifnar1SA mice (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 11).",

Despite the use of IFN in treatment of chronic viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis C and B viruses, the hepatic side effects including exacerbation of liver damage after IFN administration has been widely reported (Dusheiko, 1997). We proposed previously that the interventions aimed to enable IFNAR1 to withstand inflammatory elimination may increase the efficacy of IFN against tumors (Huangfu et al, 2012). Our current results argue to expand the clinical considerations for preventive stimulation of IFNAR1 turnover through PKD2/p38 induction in order to further limit the harmful effects of IFN.",

These data provide a proof of principle for pharmacologic downregulation of IFNAR1 to be used against acute life-threatening inflammatory conditions where the concerns for attenuated anti-viral or anti-tumor defenses are secondary. Similar to LPA, numerous natural and synthetic agonists of G-protein coupled receptors are capable of activating PKD2 and p38 kinases (Rosenbaum et al, 2009; Tilley, 2011). Some of these agents and their receptors were already shown to play a role in regulating the severity of inflammation (Ohta ' Sitkovsky, 2001). The usefulness of these receptors' agonists may be helped by the fact that these receptors are expressed either ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner (Jacoby et al, 2006) thereby affording systemic or selective protective effects.",

Briefly, acute pancreatitis was induced in by 8 hourly intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (50 \u03bcg/kg) for two consecutive days. Blood was collected from the tail vein at 3 or 7 days after the first injection. At this point, mice were sacrificed and pancreata were harvested and processed for mRNA isolation and either frozen section-immunohistochemistry or formalin-fixation and subsequent hematoxylin-eosin staining. Amylase assays were carried out as per manufacturer instructions (QuantiChrom \u03b1-Amylase Assay Kit). Chronic pancreatitis was induced by injections of caerulein (50 \u03bcg/kg per day for 5 days a week for 4 weeks). At the end of every week (day 5) blood was collected from the tail vein. Mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and pancreata were harvested and analyzed as indicated above.",

To induce toxic hepatitis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg) or vehicle (olive oil) and sacrificed after 48 h. Alternatively, mice were injected with acetaminophen (APAP, 150 mg/kg, i.p.) and sacrificed after 24 h. Blood was processed for ALT/AST analyses. Livers were either flash frozen for extracting mRNA or fixed in 4% formalin for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histopathologic analyses were carried in a double blinded manner by a qualified veterinary pathologist (A.B.). Quantification of the lesions was carried out by counting the number of lesions per field; an average of ten fields per mouse and five mice per group were scored. The assessment of the severity of hepatitis was done by evaluating tissues on a scale of 0\u20133 where the scores were representative of grades of 0 (none/minimal inflammation), 1 (mild hepatitis), 2 (moderate hepatitis with limited necrotic foci) and 3 (severe hepatitis that includes marked necrosis and displays multifocal to coalescing hepatocellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy with vacuolation).",
