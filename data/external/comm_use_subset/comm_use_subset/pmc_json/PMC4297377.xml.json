Rodents are considered to be natural hosts of EMCV and are thought to be the primary reservoir and disseminators of the virus. Out of all domestic animals, pigs are the most susceptible to EMCV infection, which can cause severe economic losses on pig production due to high mortality in piglets as a result of respiratory failure [2,9,10] and in sows as a result of myocarditis and reproductive failure [11-13].",

The ORF encodes for a polyprotein that comprises both non-structural and structural elements divided into three primary precursor molecules, namely P1, P2 and P3, encoding for 11 distinct proteins. The structural proteins VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 make up the viral capsid and are encoded in the P1 region towards the 5\u2032-end of the genome. The viral capsid proteins, in their capacity to interact with cellular receptors, are crucial for this entry step and may be considered to be factors that can modulate EMCV virulence [1]. The three major capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3 that constitute the external virion shell of picornaviruses, are considered to play a pivotal role in viral infection and host recognition [16]. Among them, VP1 is one of the most antigenic and can stimulate the organism to produce neutralization antibody [17,18].",

The VP1 protein of NJ08 had very few amino acid changes and no deletions or additions in the sequence compared to the mengo virus VP1 sequence as shown in Figure 7. Therefore any of the 2 structures could be used a 3D model to map the epitopes within the context of the complete viral particle. As show in Figure 8, the 3 epitopes presented as spheres were shown within the context of the complete particle with colors of red for VP1, green for VP3, yellow for VP2 and blue for VP4. The epitopes V(2)ENAEK(7) and F(19)VAQPVY(25) shown as cyan and magenta spheres were partially buried in the viron. P(42)IGAFTVK(49) shown as orange spheres was located circa the 5-fold icosahedral axis of symmetry and was on the surface.",

Studies of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) demonstrated that the amino acids on the loops exposed to the surface of the virion were important disease determinants [33]. The residue 49 was located in the loop connecting the \u03b2B and \u03b2C strands of VP1, which was exposed at the surface of the capsid and was known to be part of a neutralization epitope [34]. In this study, the results of alignment of the amino acid sequences of different EMCV isolates revealed that the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25) was highly conserved among all the reference EMCV strains. There were only 1 or 2 amino acid residue different in the epitopes P(42)IGAFTVK(49) and V(2)ENAEK(7) between those strains. According to the model of mengo virus, the 3D model of VP1 of EMCV was also analyzed.
