Measles virus (MV) is one of the most infectious human viruses known, and has been targeted by the World Health Organization for eradication through the use of vaccines. The paramyxovirus family includes several other viruses with high prevalence and public health impact in humans, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), mumps virus (MuV), and the parainfluenza viruses (PIV) [2]. In addition, newly emerging members of the Paramyxoviridae family \u2013 hendra and nipah virus \u2013 have caused fatal infections in humans upon zoonoses from animal reservoirs [3], [4], [5]. In animals, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is and Rinderpest virus (RPV) was among the viruses with the most devastating impact on animal husbandry. Members of the Paramyxoviridae family switch hosts at a higher rate than most other virus families [6] and infect a wide range of host species, including humans, non-human primates, horses, dogs, sheep, pigs, cats, mice, rats, dolphins, porpoises, fish, seals, whales, birds, bats, and cattle [7]. Thus, the impact of paramyxoviruses to general human and animal welfare is immense.",

The subfamily Paramyxovirinae includes five genera: Rubulavirus, Avulavirus, Respirovirus, Henipavirus and Morbillivirus. The subfamily Pneumovirinae includes two genera: Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus\n[7]. Classification of the Paramyxoviridae family is based on differences in the organization of the virus genome, the sequence relationship of the encoded proteins, the biological activity of the proteins, and morphological characteristics [1], [7]. Virions from this family are enveloped, pleomorphic, and have a single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. Complete genomic RNA sequences for known members of the family range from 13\u201319 kilobases in length. The RNA consists of six to ten tandemly linked genes, of which three form the minimal polymerase complex; nucleoprotein (N or NP), phosphoprotein (P) and large polymerase protein (L). Paramyxoviruses further uniformly encode the matrix (M) and fusion (F) proteins, and \u2013 depending on virus genus \u2013 encode additional surface glycoproteins such as the attachment protein (G), hemagglutinin or hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (H, HN), short-hydrophic protein (SH) and regulatory proteins such as non-structural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1, NS2), matrix protein 2 (M2.1, M2.2), and C and V proteins [1], [7].",

            "text": "Routine diagnosis of paramyxovirus infections in humans and animals is generally performed by virus isolation in cell culture, molecular diagnostic tests such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, and serological tests. Such tests are generally designed to be highly sensitive and specific for particular paramyxovirus species. However, to detect zoonotic, unknown, and newly emerging pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family, these tests may be less suitable. Development of virus family-wide PCR assays has greatly facilitated the detection of previously unknown and emerging viruses. Examples of such PCR assays are available for the flaviviruses [8], coronaviruses [9], [10] and adenoviruses [11]. For the Paramyxoviridae, Tong et al. described semi-nested or nested PCR assays to detect members of the Paramyxovirinae or Pneumovirinae subfamily or groups of genera within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily [12]. Although these tests are valuable for specific purposes, nesting of PCR assays and requirement for multiple primer-sets are sub-optimal for high-throughput diagnostic approaches, due to the higher risk of cross-contamination, higher cost, and being more laborious.\u201d Here, a PCR assay is described that detects all genera of the Paramyxoviridae with a single set of primers without the requirement of nesting. This assay was shown to detect all known viruses within the Paramyxoviridae family tested. As the assay is implemented in a high-throughput format of fragment analysis, the test will be useful for the rapid identification of zoonotic and newly emerging paramyxoviruses.",

            "text": "Thirty-three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene nucleotide sequences recorded in Genbank, representative for the species within the Paramyxoviridae family, were downloaded. BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor was used to align the sequences, and to run Clustal W alignments. First, an amino acid sequence alignment was made of all species within the Paramyxoviridae family to locate conserved motifs. The most conserved motifs were found in domain III of the polymerase protein. A forced nucleotide alignment was made based on the motifs found in the amino acid alignment. On the basis of this alignment the consensus degenerate and inosine-containing forward and reverse primers, PMX1 and PMX2, respectively, were designed. Because there was ambiguity on several nucleotide positions in the primers, nucleotide degeneracy was applied to both the forward and reverse primer. The primers were designed to amplify a fragment with a total size of 121 base pairs. The variability between the genomic sequences of all paramyxovirus species at each nucleotide position in the PCR primers was calculated using the entropy algorithm available from the Bioedit software package [13], [14]. Entropy values were plotted for each nucleotide position in the primers (Figure 1). Considerable heterogeneity was still present for each of the oligonucleotides, but this was primarily restricted to the 5\u2032 ends of the oligonucleotides. The 3\u2032 ends of oligonucleotides are of greatest importance for the successful amplification by PCR. The 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer PMX2 was designed to anneal to the highly conserved motif GDNQ, which has been proposed to be the active site for nucleotide polymerization [15]. The entropy plots show high conservation of the 14 terminal nucleotides at the 3\u2032 ends of both primers. Forward primer PMX1 contains a thymine at position 20, where hendra virus, nipah virus and PIV-5 contain a cytosine at that position. Reverse primer PMX2 shows 2 mismatches within the 14 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the primer. In this region, APMV-6 and henipaviruses have a single nucleotide mismatch to the primer.",

The sample collection included clinical specimens positive for MuV, HMPV, MV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV-A, and RSV-B. Four different types of clinical specimens were used: oral, (sputum, saliva, throat swab and mouth swab), nose (nose wash and nose swab), lung (broncho-alveolar lavage), and other (plasma and urine). Virus load, as measured by the cycle threshold (Ct) value in real-time Taqman assays, ranged from Ct 15 to Ct 38. Thirty-five samples were selected, RNA was extracted using the MagnaPure LC system, and the RT-PCR assay for detection of paramyxoviruses and fragment analysis was performed (Figure 4). Out of the 35 samples, the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay detected 27 human paramyxoviruses. The sample with the lowest Ct value (highest concentration target nucleic acid) that remained negative in the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay was a nose wash containing PIV-2 with a CT value of 30. The virus load in the 8 samples that remained negative in the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay (mean Ct 34.7, standard deviation 2.5) was lower than the load in the 27 samples yielding a positive reaction (mean Ct 24.5, standard deviation 5.2). Out of the virus specimens tested, 2/3 of the MuV specimens were positive, 4/4 for HMPV, 2/3 for MV, 3/5 for PIV-1, 4/5 for PIV-2, 3/3 for PIV-3, 3/5 for PIV-4, 4/5 for RSV-A, and 4/5 for RSV-B.",

            "text": "Here, a high-throughput pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay is described. The polymerase gene is the most conserved gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, and was therefore selected as the target for primer design. The primers were designed using an amino acid alignment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein that contained motifs conserved among all members of the seven genera composing the Paramyxoviridae family. The forward and reverse primers anneal at sites that are highly conserved. Sequence comparison of the polymerase gene of paramyxoviruses has revealed six highly conserved domains (I to VI), which are predicted to be essential for the key functions of RNA binding, RNA replication, and protein kinase activity [17], [18]. Domain III was proposed to function as the nucleotide polymerase. The primers used in this assay anneal to domain III. Most interestingly, the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer PMX2 anneals to the conserved motif GDNQ, which is proposed to be the active site for nucleotide polymerization [15]. Because of this conservation, we can not exclude that this assay may detect other mononegavirales, such as Filo-, Borna-, and Rhabdoviruses. However, Primer PMX1 shows a maximum of 3 mismatches with paramyxoviruses, whilst Filo-, Borna-, and Rhabdoviruses show on average 6 or 7 mismatches with this primer. Likewise, primer PMX2 has a maximum of 4 mismatches with paramyxoviruses, whilst Filo-, Borna-, and Rhabdoviruses show on average 7 to 9 mismatches. It is thus likely that detection of paramyxoviruses is most efficient. In the future, this conserved region may also be used as a target for the development of a pan-rhabdovirus RT-PCR assay or for other members of the order Mononegavirales as this region appears to be conserved within several virus families.",

Paramyxoviruses were not detected in the two urine samples that were present in the sample set, which was likely due to the low copy numbers present in these samples (Ct 33 and 35).

All samples were stored in transport medium consisting of Hanks balanced salt solution containing 0.5% lactalbumin, 10% glycerol, 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL polymyxin B sulfate, 250 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, and 50 U/mL nystatin (ICN, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). All bird samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C or at \u221220\u00b0C if rapid transport or storage at \u221280\u00b0C was not possible. Frozen samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C in the laboratory upon arrival and were thawed no more than two times prior to analysis.",
