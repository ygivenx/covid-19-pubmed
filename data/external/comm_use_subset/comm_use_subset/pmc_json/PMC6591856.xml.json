MGs can be either planned or spontaneous and recurrent or sporadic. Planned MGs may include sporting, social, cultural, religious, and political events. Examples include music festivals, the Olympic Games, the Hajj, and the Kumbh mela [1, 2]. Spontaneous MGs by their nature are more difficult to plan for and may include events such as funerals of religious and political figures [2]. MGs may also include the gatherings of displaced populations due to natural disasters, conflicts, and wars [1].",

            "text": "Such gatherings have several public health implications. There is increased risk of disease transmission because of huge influx of those attending the event. Overcrowding and overwhelmed medical services in such gatherings often aggravate the risk of infectious disease outbreaks [3]. Considerable challenges are posed by a mass gathering event (MG) in terms of communicable and non-communicable disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, environmental health, vaccination, crowd management, and various other issues [4]. In spite of the fact that MGs are an undeniably regular activity of our society that are attended by huge crowds, such gatherings are not very well understood. Even though such gatherings are accumulations of \u201cwell people,\u201d vast number of people associated with MGs can put a serious strain on the entire health care system [3]. Along these lines, such MG events are more perilous and hazardous in terms of higher incidence of injury and illness compared to population in general [5]. Preplanning for MG events is crucial, and identification of potential health risks can be a vital element in pre-event planning for a MG [6]. Broadly, it includes health management and major incident planning [7]. Public health managers need to plan for, and respond to, a wide range of incidents and emergencies that could affect health or patient care. These could be anything from extreme weather conditions to an outbreak of an infectious disease or a major transport accident related to the MG event [1]. It is important to note that planning for MG events offer a chance to enhance health service delivery, strengthen public health systems, and escalate health promotion activities [8] but failure to plan sufficiently can also disturb the routine health services as the existing system is not attuned to deal with such gatherings of people [9]. The aim of public health at MGs is to prevent or limit the risk of injury or ill health and boost safety for participants, spectators, and residents of host community. Scope of planning for MG is largely dependent on the type of event, risk assessments (RAs), and available resources. Unfortunately, effective preparedness to mitigate and control health risks are inadequate when it comes to planning and management of MG events, especially in countries with poor resources [1]. It is important to note that public health priorities are determined based on the assumptions laid down during initial stages of public health planning of MGs [10]. For instance, in the development of any surveillance system, utilizing syndromic surveillance during MGs requires making suitable inquiries of the data before the event. Those inquiries are a result of RA, a process which has to be performed before and during the event in order to determine what public health-related outcomes will potentially occur and whether these outcomes can be addressed through syndromic surveillance [11]. RA serves as an initial step in the process of planning [12]. RA for a MG is a process that determines the intent and implementation of risk reduction measures, response planning, and capacity building for health functions. RA for MGs is undertaken to empower the public health authorities to identify and evaluate the generic characteristics of a MG which introduce or escalate specific threats. It incorporates assessment of the potential public health effects of the MG [1]. Systematic assessment of risks also helps to identify the potential health security risks that require cooperation of other departments and government agencies [8]. Existing research in the field of MG health is dedicated to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, monitoring and response, and treatment and vaccines. Public health surveillance systems are less likely to include information on non-infectious health threats such as air quality, which can be extremely important for event organizers. This area poses particular challenges for traditional public health surveillance which is generally designed to detect when things happen. This is where RA comes into picture [13]. For example, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identification of such risks had allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. For instance, provision of shaded areas reduced the incidence of heat-related illnesses and effective crowd control reduced the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identified as health risks for other types of MGs [14]; therefore, restriction of their use mitigated the associated illnesses. In the context of limited resources, it has been suggested that one can choose to alleviate more likely events even if their potential impacts are smaller. Events that are catastrophic, but extremely unlikely, can then be given less priority [15]. During religious gatherings in India, some special events and unforeseen events occur at the places of religious MGs besides fixed places of worshipping. Special events like idol procession, chariot pulling, fire walking, and animal sacrificing happen pulling larger crowds within the MGs and causing more damage to human beings and property. History is in replete with incidences when MGs at fairs and festivals of India have turned into the hotspots of various types of risks [16]. Fire incidents have been reported to have occurred as a result of plastic sheets used as construction material for building cottages as temporary shelters for the pilgrims and also due to the use of liquid petroleum gas cylinders in the Kumbh mela premises and presence of unplanned and faulty electrical lines near lodging areas [17]. Previous studies [18, 19] have reported impaired water quality of Ganges River and consequential health risks by virtue of mass ritualistic bathing and insisted time and again that water of river Ganges was not fit for drinking or bathing purposes. A 10-year analysis of public health safety in 27 traditional MG events of India indicated around 936 dead and 540 injured casualties [20].",

The former method is undertaken before the event to thoroughly examine the potential risks. In addition to this, case-based RA may be required if a significant health concern is detected during the course of the event. It is worth mentioning that WHO has pointed out that event assessment and host country context assessment are extremely important for RA process [1]. A tool based on the modified version of British \u201cPurple Guide\u201d (a British guide for health, safety and welfare at music and other events) adjusted to Swedish context was developed with the aim to improve the quality of event\u2019s planning. The reliability and validity of this tool was assessed on simulated case studies rather than real-life events [24]. A stratification scoring model was developed by Hartmann et al. [25] to predict resource use at the MGs. This model categorizes events into only three discreet severity types (minor, intermediate, major). Variables included are limited to attendance, heat index (if outdoor), presence of ethanol, crowd age, and crowd intention. For this, a retrospective observational study was conducted using records of 55 events of varying type. However, details of the various encounters during each event were not always available. Major shortcoming of this analysis was the inability to identify the individual impact of each of the predictive factors. To find a safe and easy method for the estimation of healthcare resources at sporting events, a template based on validated Swedish version of British event safety guide for music events was proposed by a team of researchers [26]. It was tested in six fictitious events. The authors concluded in their study that template could be used to estimate the healthcare resources in Sweden. However, they recommended that use of such a template requires some experience from previous RAs.",

            "text": "Tamil Nadu, a state in the southern part of India, also known as the land of temples, will be the study site. It celebrates fairs and festivals round the year in all the districts with varying number of participants. Pilgrimage centers in Tamil Nadu are divided into \u201cPlaces of Perennial Pilgrimage\u201d and \u201cPeriodic Fairs and Festivals\u201d [27]. Places of Perennial Pilgrimage are the ones which possess some special religious sanctity of their own apart from the occurrence of a holy day and which attracts pious persons in considerable numbers throughout the year, while places of fairs and festivals are those at which pilgrims congregate in numbers only on one or more special occasions during the year when the attraction may be either religious or secular or both. At places of periodic fairs and festivals, it is only at the time of the actual fairs and festivals that the place springs into importance and calls for special public health measures. Tamil Nadu is one of the states in India with best public health outcome indicators and one of the very few states with a dedicated public health care [28]. Public health has its own dedicated directorate in the State Health Department, in place since 1922 [29].The division has three key directorates which are hierarchically on an equivalent balance under the Health Secretary: the Directorates of Public Health, of Medical Services, and of Medical Education. At a district level, The Deputy Director of Health Services (DDHS) is responsible for the health of the district as a whole. DDHS broadly focuses on preventive and primary health care and is accountable to the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) for delivering both these types of service. DDHS manages all the workers at the district and block levels downwards who work on rural health, including all the staff of the Primary Health Centers and sub centers. However, in large municipalities, public health services are managed by municipal health officers (MHOs) nominated from the Directorate of Public Health as well. Usually, MHOs are supported by a staff of Sanitary Inspectors. Public health service arrangement in Tamil Nadu is greatly enabled by the fact that it has a Public Health Act. It gives the legislative foundation to Directorate of Public Health for policy planning and execution of public health activities. In Tamil Nadu, preparedness and management of MG events is guided by the Public Health Code (Part III Fairs and Festivals and Epidemics) and Tamil Nadu Public Health Act (1939). This document [27] lists around 123 fairs and festivals as \u201cnotified events\u201d in the gazette for undertaking public health measures in the festival area.",

In a situation, where other kinds of validity are not feasible, content validity is an established and accepted method for validation in scientific community. Content validation methods focus on content relevance and content representation [30]. Multiple statistical measures of content validity like CVI and Kappa will be reported.

S-CVI (Scale Content Validity Index), index for inter-rater agreement (agreement proportion), and Kappa agreement coefficient will be calculated. Content validity index (CVI) is the most widely used index in quantitative evaluation [31] because it is simple for calculation, is easy to understand, and provide information about each item, which can be used for modification or deletion of instrument items. There are two kinds of CVI namely content validity of individual items (I-CVI), and the second is content validity of the overall scale (S-CVI). Researchers recommend [32] that a scale with excellent content validity should be composed of I-CVIs of 0.78 or higher and S-CVI/UA and S-CVI/Ave of 0.8 and 0.9 or higher, respectively. Kappa statistic is a consensus index of inter-rater agreement that adjusts for chance agreement [33] and is an important supplement to CVI because Kappa provides information about degree of agreement beyond chance [34].",

The little that has been done in the field of MG has generally focused on description of preparedness activities of single event, crowd control, and prevention of stampedes with little attention to public health preparedness. It is pertinent to ask how current information and comprehension about MG events can be connected crosswise over various events. This study will take into account experiences, opinions, suggestions, risks, needs, and challenges associated with MG events by conducting one to one semi-structured interviews among the identified key informants. In addition, perspectives of the community, i.e., residents and visitors, will be explored and taken into account for the development of tool. This will help to understand community perspectives which will be useful to identify and understand the characteristics of MG event and also help to plan measures to address the risks identified.",
