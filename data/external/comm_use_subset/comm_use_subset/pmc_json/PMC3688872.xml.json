Vaccines against specific pathogens are the most effective means of protecting humans from infection. However, it takes many years or even decades, to research, develop and manufacture a vaccine against an emerging pathogen. Preparedness for new pandemics or outbreaks of virulent infectious diseases has been a challenging demand on public health. It has been shown that individuals who recover from H5N1 or H1N1 viral infections can generate neutralizing antibodies against the pathogen, and their plasma confers therapeutic protection in infected individuals when administered passively [1,2]. However, plasma from convalescent individuals may not be available in sufficient quantities or may be nonexistent if there are no survivors in future pandemics or new and emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, a method to rapidly generate and select neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for the defense against new virulent pathogens.",

The screening of a naive or synthetic antibody phage display library of human origin can lead to the identification of human-like mAbs; however, there are concerns regarding the lack of in vivo maturation against the target antigen to obtain the optimal neutralizing antibodies exhibiting high affinity and potency. Several methods have been reported in which neutralizing mAbs have been cloned from infected or vaccinated individuals using single B cell cloning or phage display [3-13]. However, a human survivor may not be available during every outbreak, and there are ethical and legal issues associated with using human subjects for immunizing an individual with a pathogen or antigen, especially when an approved vaccine is not available. Because the genome and immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques share over 92% homology with humans [14,15], we generated human-like mAbs from rhesus macaques immunized with target antigens.",

            "text": "In this study, we used the influenza virus as a model pathogen to demonstrate an integrated solution to generate high affinity neutralizing mAbs that were around 97% identical to human immunoglobulin. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 exhibits a high mortality rate in humans [16]. Given the absence of anti-H5N1 immunity in the human population, there are concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic influenza pandemic should a H5N1 virus gain human-to-human transmission ability. The two classes of antiviral drugs that have been used for early intervention in treating influenza A viral infection are 1) the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which inhibit viral maturation and spreading and 2) the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine, which block the viral M2 proton channel and inhibit viral uncoating after entry. However, these drugs are only effective when used during the early stage of infection, and there are increasing reports of resistance to these drugs [17]. Studies using mouse models and clinical observations have indicated that neutralizing antibodies may provide better therapeutic efficacy than existing antiviral drugs, even at the later stages of infection [1,2,18]. In this study, we demonstrated an integrated process as follows: 1) the use of recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying synthetic genes encoding the target antigens allowed the rapid preparation of antigens without the need for having the pathogen in hand; 2) the immunization of rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulata) with the vectored antigen or the pathogen, if available; 3) the screening of an antibody phage display library derived from B cells harvested from immunized macaques; 4) cloning the macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions and combining them with human constant regions to generate human-macaque chimeric mAbs; and 5) further characterization of the mAbs using in vitro and in vivo studies. Our study demonstrated a practical option for the rapid generation of neutralizing mAbs for potential application in humans in preparedness for outbreaks of a new influenza or other virulent infectious diseases.

During a pandemic, the pathogen may not be available because of bio-safety, transportation, and technology, issues and even social or political barriers. Earlier studies by our lab and others [19-21] have shown that the adenovirus-mediated delivery of antigens, including influenza HA, induces a robust antibody response within a short period after immunization. In this study, we first synthesized three hemagglutinin (HA) genes based on human codon usage for optimal expression in mammalian cells. Next, we constructed three recombinant replication-incompetent adenoviruses (Ad5), Ad5-HA(97HK), Ad5-HA(04VN), and Ad5-HA(06ZJ), carrying the full-length HA genes representing three different clades of H5N1 viruses, including the HAs of A/Hong Kong/482/97 (clade 0), A/Vietnam/1194/04 (clade 1), and A/Zhe Jiang/16/06 (clade 2), respectively. The adenoviral vector-mediated expression of the HA proteins was confirmed using Western blot analysis of Ad5-HA-infected HEK293 cell lysates, which revealed the expression of HA0 and its cleavage into HA1 and HA2 (Figure 1a).",

At various intervals, the serum samples were collected for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against the different clades of H5N1 viruses. A micro-neutralization (MN) assay was used to monitor the kinetics of the neutralizing antibodies against recombinant influenza viruses carrying each of the three HA clades in the PR8 backbone, r97HKHA-PR8, r04VNHA-PR8, and r06ZJHA-PR8 influenza viruses, respectively. The neutralizing antibodies were detected at 2 weeks after the initial immunization, the levels were increased at 4 weeks and continued to increase at 6 weeks and 10 weeks following additional immunizations. The neutralizing antibodies were maintained at high levels for at least 22 weeks. The sera collected from the macaques from 2 to 22 weeks neutralized all three clades of the H5N1 recombinant viruses but not the H1N1 influenza virus PR8 (Figure 1b). The Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of serum antibodies that bound the HA0, HA1, and HA2 of all three clades of the H5N1 viruses tested but not the H1N1 virus PR8 (Figure 1c). These data demonstrated that the adenovirus-mediated expression of HA effectively elicited the production of neutralizing antibodies against HA proteins in rhesus macaques as early as two weeks after immunization.",

Based on published data regarding the rhesus immunoglobulin genes and the closest corresponding human immunoglobulin genes [22-31], we used PCR to amplify the VH and the VL cDNAs derived from B cells. PCR products were used to construct scFv-presenting phage libraries for each macaque. Each library contained approximately 2.4 x 107 clones. The phage library from one of the macaques was subjected to 2 rounds of panning using a recombinant VN04HA protein as the target antigen. The ELISA screening using inactivated recombinant influenza viruses resulted in the isolation of 87 clones. Based on the analysis of the VH sequences, 39 scFv clones containing unique complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences were selected for conversion into full-length IgG1 antibodies by cloning into the gene encoding the human constant region (IgG1) for expression in mammalian cells. The human-macaque chimeric mAbs (8 in total) demonstrated strong neutralizing activities against all three clades of H5N1 viruses using a plaque-reduction assay and the r04VNHA-PR8, r97HKHA-PR8, and r06ZJHA-PR8 viruses. For further analysis, we selected three mAbs that represented different families of VH and VL (Figure 2a). Notably, mAbs 4E6 and 4D5 contained a somewhat longer CDRH3 measuring 19 amino acid residues. The VHs in 4E6 and 4D5 demonstrated the most similarity to the human VH4 family, whereas the VH in 1H10 most closely resembled the human VH1-69 family. The immunofluorescent analysis confirmed the binding of these three mAbs to viruses in cells infected with the three clades of the recombinant H5N1 viruses but did not exhibit reactivity against the H1N1 virus PR8 (Figure 2b). The Western blot analysis demonstrated that mAb 4E6 reacted with the HA0 and HA1 fragments of all three HAs but did not demonstrate reactivity against the HA2 region (Figure 2c). In the Western blot, the mAbs 4D5 and 1H10 did not demonstrate reactivity against HA proteins, indicating that these mAbs likely bind to conformational epitopes on HA.",

            "text": "The influenza viral HA protein mediates viral entry in two steps. In the attachment step, HA binds to the sialic acid cell surface receptor, and the virus is endocytosed into the cell, and in the post-attachment step, the acidification of the endosome induces a conformational change in HA that leads to the release of viral RNA for subsequent replication. First, we used a micro-neutralization assay to determine the neutralizing activities of these mAbs against the r97HKHA-PR8, r04VNHA-PR8, and r06ZJHA-PR8 recombinant influenza viruses (Table 1). The mAbs demonstrated cross-clade neutralizing activities against these H5N1 viruses but not against the H1N1 virus PR8. The mAb 4E6 exhibited 100% inhibition at a potency of less than 0.39 \u00b5g/ml for the clade 0 and the clade 1 H5N1 viruses and at a moderate potency (6.25 \u00b5g/ml) against the clade 2 virus. The mAb 1H10 demonstrated 100% inhibition against the clade 0 virus at 1.39 \u00b5g/ml and against the clade 1 and clade 2 viruses at 6.25 \u00b5g/ml. We then performed a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay for the three mAbs (Table 2), and the results indicated that 4E6 and 4D5 blocked the binding of the virion to the cell surface receptor, whereas 1H10 likely affected the post-attachment process. Taken together with the Western blot and immunofluorescent analyses, the data suggest that that 4E6 likely bound to an epitope on the globular head of HA, whereas 1H10 bound to a conformational epitope that is not associated with cell receptor binding but is important for the post-attachment step.",

In particular, the mAb 4E6 exhibited an extremely high affinity of 22.3 pM and an extremely slow dissociation rate of 6.14x10-5/s-1 to the HA protein from H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04. The mAb 1H10 exhibited a high affinity (27.2 nM) to the HA protein of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04. Both 4E6 and 4D5 mAbs contained a somewhat longer CDR-H3 (19 amino acids), which might have contributed to the high affinity and slow dissociation rate for the HA protein. Because 4E6 exhibited an extremely high affinity to HA and potent neutralizing activities against H5N1, we performed studies to identify the 4E6 binding site on HA. An escape mutant was generated by incubating r04VNHA-PR8 in the presence of a low concentration of 4E6 (Figure S1). Our data demonstrated that the mutations of aspartate (D) to asparagines (N) at amino acid position 183 (D183N) and lysine (K) to glutamate (E) at amino acid position 189 (K189E) on the globular head resulted in the escape from the 4E6 neutralization. Furthermore, this escape mutant showed no response in the HAI to 4E6 at the concentration that could completely block hemagglutination by r04VNHA-PR8. The bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that these two amino acids are highly conserved among the majority of H5N1 viruses. All H5N1 viruses contain D183, most contain K189 or isoelectric R189. Therefore, 4E6 appears to be a broadly neutralizing antibody that may neutralize the majority of H5N1 viruses. Further study will be required to verify if 4E6 neutralizes all H5N1 that contain D183 and K(R) 189.",

These mAbs exhibit different binding kinetics to the HA protein and neutralize H5N1 via different mechanisms. The mice were first infected intranasally with 10 LD50 of the H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04. At 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours post-infection, the mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 4E6 or 1H10 at 10 mg/kg body weight. The mice that received the control IgG1 at 24 hours post-infection succumbed to infection (Figure 4A). In contrast, 100% of the mice that received 4E6 at 24 hours or 48 hours post-infection were protected, and there was 88% protection in the mice treated at 72 hours post-infection. Moreover, the mice treated with 4E6 did not exhibit a significant decrease in body weight because of the H5N1 infection (Figure 4B). The Q-PCR analysis of the lung tissues demonstrated that the mice treated with 4E6 exhibited up to 4 logs reduction in viral genome copy number compared with the control IgG-treated group (Figure 5A). Strikingly, none of the mice treated with mAb 4E6 had detectable live virus in their lungs at 6 days post-infection. In comparison, the mice that received the control IgG exhibited up to 1x106 pfu of live virus per lung, whereas the mAb 1H10-treated mice had detectable but reduced (4-5 logs reduction) live viruses in their lungs (Figure 5B). This result suggested that mAb 4E6 exhibited an extremely potent neutralizing activity that completely inhibited the H5N1 virus. The histopathological examination demonstrated that there were no visible pathological changes in the lungs from the mice treated with 4E6 at 24 hours post-infection, whereas the control group that received an irrelevant IgG exhibited severe alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration. The immunohistochemical staining of the lung cryostat sections with a mAb against the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) demonstrated the strong expression of NP in the cytoplasm of the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells in the mice that received the control IgG but not in the mice treated with 4E6 (Figure 5C). The mAb 1H10, although not as impressive as mAb 4E6, also demonstrated a high potency for protecting the mice and for viral load reduction in the lungs. 1H10 conferred 88% protection in the mice treated at 24, 48 or 72 hours after the lethal infection. Taken together, the data suggested that mAb 1H10 exhibits in vivo therapeutic efficacy against the H5N1 virus, similar to several reported mAbs, whereas mAb 4E6 represents a unique mAb with superior potency for inhibiting the H5N1 virus.

The human-like mAbs are a good alternative in the event of a virulent infectious outbreak, especially if there are no human survivors from the infection or ethical and regulatory issues arise that prevent the immunization of individuals with an antigen or a pathogen. The strategy and overall process we used in this study, i.e. immunizing rhesus macaques using adenoviral vectors carrying a synthetic gene encoding the antigen, followed by the rapid selection of mAbs using an immune-focused antibody phage display library or other mAb cloning technologies, will be of great practical use and significance. The overall process could be completed in approximately two months and entails the following five major steps (Figure 6): 1) Immunization of rhesus macaques at day 0; 2) Collection of PBMCs as early as day 14, or day 21 if a booster immunization is necessary; 3) Construction of an immunized antibody phage display library and selection of neutralizing clones, which could be completed in approximately one week; 4) Cloning the various regions of the macaque antibody into an expression plasmid containing the human immunoglobulin constant regions, which could be completed in a number of days; and 5) Production and characterization of chimeric mAbs, which could take weeks to months. However, it is important to understand that if a mAb is to be tested in humans, preclinical studies, such as safety and toxicity tests including screening against self-antigens, will be needed.",

Compared with mice and other animal species, the homology of the rhesus and human immunoglobulin genes is high. A recent analysis confirmed that the average homology between the corresponding rhesus VH and human VH genes is approximately 92% [14]. In our study, generating a chimeric antibody containing macaque VH and VL combined with human immunoglobulin constant regions, increased the degree of humanness in the full-length antibody to greater than 97%, which is much higher than human-mouse chimeric antibodies. The several human-mouse chimeric antibodies on the market contain murine-derived VH and VL and human-derived constant regions, such as infliximab/Remicade (anti-TNF\u03b1), rituximab/Rituxan (anti-CD20), cetuximab/Erbitux (anti-EGFR), and basiliximab/Simulect (anti-IL2R). However, approximately 40% of human-mouse chimeric antibodies encounter significant human anti-antibody responses in patients, compared to 9% for humanized antibodies [33]. The human-macaque chimeric antibodies are more suitable for application in humans because they are highly homologous to human antibodies and are less likely to induce human anti-chimeric antibodies than the human-mouse chimeric antibodies. This concept is supported by reports of at least two human-macaque chimeric mAbs, galiximab (IDEC-114, anti-CD80) and lumiliximab (IDEC-152, anti-CD23), in which the VH and VL from cynomolgous macaques were fused with human constant regions. In phase I and II clinical studies, no human anti-galiximab or anti-lumiliximab antibodies were detected in humans [34,35]. Finally, if needed, it would be easier to change a small number of amino acids in the framework region of the macaque VH and VL regions to produce complete germline humanization [36]. However, we believe that this change would likely be unnecessary because the framework region in our mAbs were within the range of humanness when compared with the human counterparts.",

Based on published information regarding human mAbs against the H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04, compared with mAb F10 (KD =130 pM), the mAb 4E6 exhibited the highest affinity (KD =22 pM) for H5N1 VN04HA [9]. The 4E6 mAb demonstrated a slow dissociation rate to the HA protein (6.14x10-5/s-1). Interestingly, 4E6 contains a somewhat longer CDR3 region, consisting of 19 amino acids, than the CDR3 reported for most human mAbs to influenza virus HA, which contain 12 to 17 amino acids [3,9]. We compared the 4E6 data with published data from several mAbs of human origin that have been tested in mouse models. Corti et al. described two heterosubtypic mAbs, FE43 and FE17; however, these antibodies were tested only in prophylactic mouse models in which a survival rate of 20% and 100%, respectively, was observed when used at 2.5 mg/kg body weight [10]. Simmons et al. identified three mAbs, FLA3.14, FLD21.14, and FLD20.19, which demonstrated 80%-100% therapeutic protection in mice infected with 5 LD50 H5N1 VN/04 when administered at the higher dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight [11]. Sui et al. identified several broad-spectrum mAbs, D8, F10 and A66, exhibiting affinities of 148 pM, 130 pM and 233 pM, respectively, to H5N1 VN04HA [9]. The F10 and A66 mAbs demonstrated 80-100% therapeutic protection when administered at 15 mg/kg body weight, whereas D8 was poorly effective in the therapeutic model. However, in these mAb-treated mice, between 1x103 and 1x106 pfu of live virus was detected per gram of lung tissue in the treated groups [9]. De Marco et al. identified a non-VH1-69-derived human mAb PN-SIA49 that recognizes a highly conserved epitope in the stem region of HA and exhibits a broad spectrum, neutralizing H1, H2 and H5 subtypes [37]. However, at a 10 mg/kg dose administered at 24 hours post-infection, SIA49 afforded only 67% protection in mice infected with 3 LD50 of H5N1 A/VN/1203/04. Comparing these reported mAbs with 4E6 demonstrated that mAb 4E6 is at least among the best of the mAbs reported in the literature that exhibit in vivo therapeutic efficacy against the H5N1 virus. In addition to the indistinguishable difference in the degree of humanness between 4E6 and mAbs of human origin, 4E6 conferred 100% protection in mice at 24 and 48 hours after infection and 88% protection in mice at 72 hours after infection with 10 LD50 of H5N1 A/VN/1194/04. Furthermore, a single treatment completely inactivated the H5N1 VN/04 virus in all the treated groups. We speculate that the extremely slow dissociation rate (6.14x10-5/s-1) and the HA binding epitope of 4E6 may play a role in the impressive potency of this mAb. Based on the data from the escape mutant, the 4E6 bound to a conserved site on the globular head of HA, and amino acids D183 and K/R198 are present in most H5N1 viruses. A single mutation at D183 or K/R189 in HA did not diminish the binding of 4E6. Therefore, a virus would need two mutations, at both D183 and K189, to escape neutralization by 4E6.",

Although it has been reported that mAbs can be cloned through the RT-PCR of immunoglobulin genes from single B cells or ASC cells isolated from individuals infected with influenza virus or who received influenza vaccines [4,8], the technical requirement for the B cell manipulation requires sophisticated expertise and laboratory equipment, which may not be readily available, especially in developing countries.",

The sequences were grouped into the 7VH, 6V\u03ba, 11V\u03bb, and 7JH families in accordance with the IMGT nomenclature. Based on the nucleotide sequence alignment of the individual families, we designed a set of primers targeting the conserved motifs in framework region 1 and the joining and constant regions of the H- and L-chain genes. To design the reverse primers for the heavy chain, we analyzed separately the 5\u2019 sequences of IGHV1, IGHV2, IGHV3, IGHV4, IGHV5, IGHV6 and IGHV7. For the 3\u2019 forward primers for the heavy chain, we focused on the 3\u2019 sequences of six IGHJ genes. Based on the reported macaque light-chain sequence, we designed primers for 3 IGKV subgroups and 4 IGLV subgroups. The primer sequences were degenerate at a number of positions to maximize the amplification efficiency while minimizing the creation of stop codons. Blood samples (10 ml) were collected from each rhesus macaque. The peripheral blood B lymphocytes were isolated using OptiPrep (Axis-shield, Norway). The mRNA was extracted from the lymphocytes using a Qiagen Blood RNA kit (Qiagen) and was reverse-transcribed using primers that were specific to the rhesus macaque IgG, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb constant regions [25-28]. The cloning of the VH and VL DNA fragments into the pCANTab 5E phage display vector was performed as described previously [39]. The library was panned against the recombinant HA protein of A/Vietnam/1194/04. After two rounds of phage panning, the individual clones from the enriched phage pools were analyzed using ELISA against influenza viruses. The positive clones were sequenced to determine the heavy- and light-chain sequences.
