            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are the most widespread type of infection in adults and children and are responsible for a considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. A high rate of respiratory tract infections is caused by viruses (approximately 80%) [1,2]. Within the last ten years, diagnosis of respiratory viruses has become more important, because of the unexpected emergence of several new respiratory viruses: (a) influenza A virus H5N1 (1997), (b) human metapneumovirus (hMPV; 2001; [1]), (c) coronavirus SARS (CoV-SARS; 2002); (d) mimivirus (2003; [2]); (e) coronavirus NL63 (CoV-NL63; 2004; [3]); (f) coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1; 2005; [4]), (g) human bocavirus (2005; [5]), (h) parvovirus 4 (2005; [6]), (i) influenza A virus H1N1 (INF-A; 2009). Due to the similarity in clinical presentation of respiratory tract infections, causative pathogens could not be identified on the basis of symptoms alone. However, an efficient pathogen-based prophylaxis or therapy has a significant effect on the disease progress in patients [7,8]. To overcome limitations concerning the use of several monoplex tests in parallel and the resulting shortage of sample volume, the development of multiplex tests for a fast and exact identification is necessary. Today, several multiplex tests are commercially available [9-16]. A number of studies have already compared the detection frequencies of multiplex assays with conventional monoplexPCR assays in clinical samples [12,17-19], but a comparison of the analytical sensitivity of these multiplex assays with quantified standardized control material does not exist.",

The RespiFinder-19 assay, which is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, detects 15 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria in one reaction [20]. A further development of the RespiFinder-19 assay is the RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay, which is also based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. This assay differentiates 18 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast Assay (RVP) is a bead array-based system for the detection of 19 different respiratory viruses [9,10]. Previous studies with clinical samples showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the RVP assay was 78.8% and 99.6%, respectively, compared to real-time PCR-methods, that are currently declared as the gold standard [21]. Another study performed a comparison with clinical samples of the RespiFinder-19 with the precursor assay of the RVP [7]. Both assays in this study have an excellent specificity and the sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the RespiFinder-19 assay, respectively.",

We tested different viruses in three combinations (Panel 1: INF-A H1N1, RSV-A, HRV and AdV; Panel 2: INF-A H1N1, INF-A H3N2, RSV-A, PIV-2; Panel 3: CoV OC43, CoV 229E, AdV and HRV).

The RVP assay now detect AdV (104 copies/ml panel 1, 103 copies/ml panel 3) and PIV-2 (104 copies/ml, panel 2). The RVP was still incapable of detecting CoV 229E. However, more differences were found in the detection of the pathogens using different elution volumes for both RespiFinder assays. The company PathoFinder suggests an elution volume of 100 \u03bcl for the RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay, whereas Abbott Molecular advises for the RVP assay an elution volume of 55 \u03bcl. The two assays of the company PathoFinder did not detect INF-A in samples which were extracted in 55 \u03bcl elution buffer, but detection was possible by using the advised extraction volume of 100 \u03bcl. The RespiFinder-19 detect INF-A at a concentration of 104 copies/ml (panel 1), whereas both assays detect INF-A at concentrations ranging from 102 -104 copies/ml (panel 2). The same observation was made for the detection of AdV at a concentration of 102 copies/ml (panel 1) with the RespiFinderSMART-22 by using the advised extraction volume of 100 \u03bcl. In contrast, the detection frequency of RSV-A virus was reduced for both RespiFinder assays analysing samples with 100 \u03bcl elution volume compared to 55 \u03bcl elution volume (panel 1: undiluted sample; panel 2: RespiFinder19 all samples, RespiFinderSMART-22 dilution 1:100).

            "text": "Our results indicated a possible competition for nucleotides, primer or enzymes between the different viruses in the detection of a high number of multiple infections (13 viruses in one assay). 13 viruses in one sample was the maximum demand on the multiplex PCR tests. This highly artificial experiment emphasizes the general methodological limitation of multiplex PCR assay, because nearly all multiplex assays performed terribly analyzing samples with a high number of parallel pathogens. Therefore, these results have to be interpreted with attention. In the routine clinical setting, a parallel infection with this high number of different viruses is uncommon up to impossible, and the clinical relevance of these results is initially arguable. The highest virus load in our patient cohort was a triple infection. This was also observed by other research groups [8]. Due to this fact we tested three different combinations of quadruple infections. Surprisingly, only a few differences were found compared to the highly artificial experiment with 13 viruses. Potential competitive reactions were found for the detection of RSV and AdV (RespiFinder) or INF-A, AdV and PIV-2 (RVP). However, some viruses were still not detected (e.g. RVP: CoV 229E, RespiFinder: INF-A). But we observed an influence of the elution volumes for the detection with the RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22. An elution volume of 100 \u03bcl showed the tendency of a higher analytical sensitivity. However, the elution volume seems to have differing influences depending on the contained viruses. For example, INF-A was detected more frequent in an elution volume of 100 \u03bcl, whereas RSV showed a higher detection frequency using an elution volume of 55 \u03bcl. No differences were found in the detection with the RVP assay, although we expected that the dilution of the DNA/RNA extract may result in a reduced analytical sensitivity. For routine testing using this different multiplex assays in parallel, we suggest an elution volume of 100 \u03bcl, because the remaining extract is available for retesting or analysis for non-included pathogens. If only one multiplex assay will be implemented, elution should be performed according to the specifications of the manufacturer.",

At that time, the RespiFinder-SMART-22 was not commercially available and later on, no residual extracted material was available for additional testing. For a comparison of the three multiplex assays with clinical samples further studies have to be done. This study indicated a higher clinical sensitivity of the RespiFinder-19 in the detection of virus infections in clinical samples with low concentrations in contrast to the RVP. Respiratory tract infections were found in 64% of the TS samples by RespiFinder-19. The RVP detected only 22% in the same samples, respectively. Gadsby et al.[21] also described problems in the detection of low virus concentrations with RVP; either the pathogens were not detected or they produced a false-positive for adenovirus. Raymaekers et al.[7] investigated clinical samples for a comparison of the RespiFinder-19 with the precursor assay of the RVP (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Assay, Abbott Molecular, Wiesbaden, Germany). The precursor assay of the RVP included a target specific primer extension (TSPE) in contrast to the new assay, therefore these results are not directly comparable to the present study. In Raymaekers\u2019 study, respiratory viruses were detected by RVP in 31 of 95 clinical samples and by RespiFinder-19 in 75 of 95. These results are comparable to our results and verified our results in present study. A comparison of the precursor assay of the RVP with the newer RVP assay was made by Pabbaraju et al.[9]. They showed that the older assay was more sensitive than the newer RVP Fast assay (88.6% and 77.5% sensitivities, respectively) for all the viral targets combined. This corresponds to our observations concerning the RespiFinder-19. However, the higher sensitivity of the RespiFinder-19 assay may also be due to the detection of incidental but non-causal viruses. In 32% of the February TS samples the RespiFinder-19 assay detected multiple infections, corresponding to results of Fox [10], whereas the RVP assay detected no multiple infections. Raymaekers et al. also described problems in the detection of co-infections with the RVP. Samples which include adenovirus and coronavirus were false-negative with the RVP. We observed these problems in samples, which were positive for CMV and adenovirus. The importance of viral co-infections remains uncertain [11-13]. In summary, we detected multiple infections in 36% of the TS samples analyzed and the detection of multiple infections was only possible using the RespiFinder-19 assay. However, other studies also demonstrated the detection of multiple infections using the RVP assay [9,21]. In this context, the question arises, whether all detected viruses in multiple infections are clinically relevant or not. In some cases the pathogens of the co-infections cause more serious illnesses, e.g. coronavirus, RSV or hMPV, than the pathogens of the primary infection, e.g. rhinovirus. With this study approach, none of the three assays can differentiate between pathogens of the primary infection and the co-infecting virus. Therefore, the clinical relevance of additionally detected viruses has to be correlated in further studies.",

The RespiFinder-19 also needs more hands-on-time steps than the RVP. The RespiFinder-SMART-22, as a further development of the RespiFinder-19, delivers a result after six hours. This amounts to a time saving of one and a half hour. For a significant effect on disease progress, patients with respiratory tract infections need an efficient pathogen based prophylaxis or therapy. Multiplex PCR methods allow a fast and exact identification of the causative pathogens. For routine application the analytical sensitivity must balance out the time-to-result. In our opinion, the turn-around-times of the RespiFinder-SMART-22 and RVP assay did not have a significant impact on patient treatment, because both assays provided results within one working day.
