Rather, MERS-CoV infection is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as disease is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, MERS-CoV infection can result in kidney failure, ultimately leading to death [1\u20133]. As of 29 October 2015, 628 deaths from 1635 cases of MERS-CoV had been identified worldwide, a case fatality rate of 39.02% [4]. Human infections with MERS-CoV typically occur in countries located in the Middle East, but in May 2015 an outbreak was reported in South Korea, in which three super-spreaders were found to be responsible for the majority of infections, as well as evidence of tertiary human-to-human transmission [5]. As such, there is an urgent need for the development of an efficacious vaccine against MERS-CoV.",

Inactivated vaccines are safe for use, but typically only induce humoural immunity and very low levels of cell-mediated responses. There are no reports of inactivated MERS-CoV being tested as a vaccine, but an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine appears to have little effect in mice and domestic ferrets [6\u20138]. Recently, candidate vaccines are genetically engineered to be replication-deficient or avirulent before use, therefore eliminating the concern that live-attenuated vaccines could revert to virulence. A recombinant MERS-CoV lacking the E structural protein was previously developed as a candidate vaccine; however, its protective efficacy has not yet been demonstrated [9].",

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are protein-only subunit vaccines that emulate the morphology of the native virus. Compared with inactivated or live-attenuated virus vaccines, VLPs are able to induce robust humoural and cellular immune responses without the risk of reversion to virulence [13, 14].

The results of immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the expression of three structural proteins (Figure 2). The morphology of MERS-CoV VLPs was investigated by electron microscopy. Under TEM, the diameters of MERS-CoV VLPs were approximately 100 nm, and spikes were readily observable around the spherical particles (Figure 3A). To ensure that S was incorporated into the VLPs, immunoelectron microscopy was performed with a gold-tagged antibody against the RBD of S. Results show that the gold particles appear on the MERS-CoV VLPs (Figure 3B), demonstrating that the particle contain S. Each composition of the MERS-CoV VLPs was confirmed by Western blot, and bands corresponding to S, M and E in MERS-CoV VLPs were observed (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs autonomously assemble in insect cells that have been infected by our recombinant baculovirus, and are structurally similar to the native virus [15].",

The co-expression of S, E and M by a single recombinant virus allowed for the efficient assembly and release of VLPs not only closely resembled SARS-CoV in size and particle morphology, but also virus morphogenesis [20]. However, in our study co-infection of the MERS-CoV S and M recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells did not result in VLPs formation, as assessed by TEM (data not shown). Rather, we demonstrated that VLPs consisting three structural envelope proteins (S, E, M) can be generated in insect cells with similar morphology to MERS-CoV virions. The expression of S protein from insect cells was slightly larger than that from mammalian cells, suggesting that the glycosylation of our VLPs is complete. To our knowledge, this is the first report which showed the successful generation of MERS-CoV VLPs consisting of immunogenic proteins.",

The NHPs develop transient infection but do not die from infection, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing DPP4 die from MERS-CoV infection [23, 24]. As such, the protective efficacy of candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV cannot be evaluated in animals under the most stringent conditions. Due to the immunological similarity of rhesus macaques to humans [21, 25], the next best choice is to determine whether our MERS-CoV VLPs are able to elicit robust levels of immunogenicity in NHPs, in hope that humans will react to the vaccine in a similar manner. This rationale is supported by a past study that also used rhesus macaques for the evaluation of a candidate countermeasure against MERS-CoV infection [26].",

Vaccination with MERS-CoV VLPs also resulted in T-cell responses to RBD, as assessed by ELIspot assay of peptide-stimulated PBMCs. IFN-\u03b3, but not IL-4 secretion was detected from PBMCs, suggesting that VLPs elicited a Th1-mediated response.

Blood samples were collected from the femoral vein of monkeys before immunization and two weeks after each immunization. B. ELISA results show that immunized monkeys were able to induce a robust humoral response specific to RBD, with serum IgG titers of up to 1:1,280 after the fourth immunization. C. Rhesus macaque blood samples were collected from the femoral vein of monkeys two weeks after last immunization. MERS-CoV live virus-based inhibition assay were taken in Vero E6 cells in triplicate. The titers were determined as the highest serum dilutions that completely prevent CPE in at least 50% of the wells (NT50) and are expressed as mean +/- SEM.
