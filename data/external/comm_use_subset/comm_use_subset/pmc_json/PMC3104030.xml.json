Such systems have proven\nreliable and timely and informal sources of information were even recognized in the\n2005 revision of the International Health Regulations as important sources of\nepidemic intelligence [18], [19]. The rapid and accelerating growth of the Internet has\nimproved the usefulness and sensitivity of these systems and they have likely\nimproved the timeliness of outbreak reporting [18], and the ever-expanding\navailability of electronic information has also led to the discovery of other types\nof analyses that detect disease outbreaks. \u201cWeb-crawlers\u201d (software\nprograms that search internet sites for specific terms, and then use these search\nterms to generate reports or maps of disease activity) can provide important\ninformation on disease outbreaks that may be published on nongovernmental websites,\nin online newspapers, and in blogs, and this approach powers the widely-used\nHealthMap system mentioned above [20]. In the context of the recent cholera outbreak in Haiti,\nthere were inconsistencies in initial accounts of regional disease activity, but\ninformation from HealthMap proved useful in the construction of a mathematical model\nthat predicted disease spread on the island [21].",

Reassuringly the authors divided their data into a derivation set and\na testing set (or \u201choldout set\u201d as they call it), with the former used\nfor model construction. As can be seen in the table and figure they present, their\nderived models perform extremely well in both sets in all countries, in the\nderivation set as expected, but also in the testing set. Perhaps less\nstraightforward is the authors' decision to \u201csmooth out\u201d unusual\nspikes in search volumes in candidate queries; as demonstrated by the influenza\nexample above, extreme surges in public interest in a disease can cause surges in\nquery volumes, as can surges in interest related particular subject that is\nunrelated to the disease under surveillance but shares attributes that would be the\nsubject of searches. By smoothing search volumes, the authors may have incorporated\ninto their models terms that have the potential to \u201cmisbehave\u201d in the\nfuture.

We think not: current high-quality public health\nsurveillance already utilizes multiple sources of information to gain a more\ncomplete picture of the incidence and distribution of disease. For example,\ninfluenza surveillance may include laboratory-based virological surveillance,\nsentinel syndromic surveillance (e.g., school-based absenteeism reports) and\nevaluation of mortality trends for pneumonia and influenza, which taken together may\nprovide a more complete picture of disease risk and impacts. Searchterm-based\nsurveillance and other modalities mentioned above thus provide an additional tool in\nthe surveillance toolbox, which has advantages over traditional surveillance as well\nas limitations. It should be noted, however, that limitations such as those\ndescribed above are not absent from traditional surveillance systems either:\nestimates of incidence can change markedly with changing case definitions, incidence\nof laboratory-confirmed disease can change markedly with augmentation or restriction\nof clinical testing or changes in diagnostic test methodologies, and syndromic\nsurveillance systems can be subject to poor specificity and frequent false alarms.\nThus supplementary information derived using methods such as the one developed by\nChan and colleagues should be welcomed by public health professionals. The\ntransparency of such systems may also help demonstrate the value of openness in\ndisease reporting, which may have \u201cspillover effects\u201d on traditional\nsurveilance systems.",
