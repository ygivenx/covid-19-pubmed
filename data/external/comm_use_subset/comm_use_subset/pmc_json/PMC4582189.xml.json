The catabolic phenotype observed in osteoarthritis is caused by an imbalance in synthesis and degradation of matrix components, mainly due to increased production of matrix-degradative enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases (Findlay and Atkin, 2014; Felson and Neogi, 2004). Among the MMPs, MMP-3 and MMP-13 are known to play crucial role in osteoarthritis cartilage destruction (Kim et al., 2014).",

Several studies have suggested that subchondral bone and articular cartilage form a functional unit, which might play a role in joint maintenance and degeneration. There is a possibility of direct signaling between the two compartments (Imhof et al., 2000; Pan et al., 2009; Clark and Huber, 1990) and that they interact through increased vascularization and development of micro cracks in the bone matrix (Sharma et al., 2013). With respect to cartilage, the diffusion of mediators has been well demonstrated. For example, insulin-like growth factor is largely transported into cartilage from the circulation (Zhang et al., 2010). Hepatocyte growth factor is found in the deep layers of cartilage; it is produced by osteoarthritis osteoblasts and found in cartilage, even though it is not expressed by chondrocytes. These results suggest the passage of this molecule from bone to cartilage (Guevremont et al., 2003).",

The proteins were first identified by Moor and Perez in 1968 (Moore et al., 1968) in the brain tissue of mammals. Members of the 14-3-3 family are highly related, and at least seven isoforms have been identified in mammal cells (\u03b2, \u03b5, \u03b7, \u03b3, \u03c4, \u03c3 and \u03b6) (Muslin et al., 1996). 14-3-3 proteins have a large number of partners and thus participate in many intracellular processes including cell cycle control, mitogenesis, cytoskeletal changes and apoptosis (Pallucca et al., 2014; Aitken, 2011). However, they can also be detected in the extracellular environment. The first secreted forms of 14-3-3 were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Creutzfeld\u2013Jacob disease (Boston et al., 1982). 14-3-3\u03b7 and 14-3-3\u03b3 proteins were detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The levels of these proteins were strongly correlated with levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3, two biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis (Kilani et al., 2007). It has been determined that 14-3-3\u03c3 is involved in the dialog between keratinocytes and fibroblasts during tissue repair. Indeed, 14-3-3\u03c3 is abundantly secreted by differentiated keratinocytes, and can induce the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-8 in dermal fibroblasts (Ghahary et al., 2004). Lung-epithelial-cell-derived 14-3-3\u03b1 and 14-3-3\u03b2 also has a potent MMP-1-inducing effect on airway fibroblasts (Asdaghi et al., 2012).",

            "text": "No receptor for 14-3-3\u03b5 has been identified in articular cartilage. However, CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N, APN) has recently been identified as a 14-3-3\u03c3 receptor on fibroblasts (Ghaffari et al., 2010). Thus, CD13 could be a potential receptor for 14-3-3\u03b5 on the chondrocyte surface. CD13 is a 150-kDa surface glycoprotein, and an ectoenzyme of the superfamily of zinc metalloproteases (EC 3.4.11.2) present in many human tissues. CD13 is widely expressed as a homodimer of high molecular mass (\u223c280 kDa) on the cell surface of tissues such as intestinal epithelia and the nervous system (Zhang et al., 2013). It preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids, most notably alanine residues, from the N-terminus of peptides (Chen et al., 2012). Polypeptide chains of this ectoenzyme are organized in different domains: a small cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain and a large extracellular domain containing the active site (Luan and Xu, 2007). CD13 plays pivotal roles in many physiological processes such as antigen-presenting regulation, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, crystallization cholesterol, phagocytosis, pain sensation, cell\u2013cell adhesion and coronavirus entry. CD13 performs these functions through its role as a receptor involved in cellular signal transduction and/or peptide cleavage through its aminopeptidase N enzymatic activity (Mina-Osorio, 2008; Gabrilovac et al., 2005). However, an involvement of CD13 in osteoarthritis has never been shown, although this molecule has been thoroughly investigated in another articular pathology, rheumatoid arthritis (Shimizu et al., 2002). Recently, Morgan and colleagues have suggested that the soluble form of CD13, released into synovial fluid, acts as a T-cell chemoattractant that induces rheumatoid arthritis synovitis (Morgan et al., 2015).",

Mouse chondrocytes transfected with siRNA1 or siRNA2 against CD13 showed significantly decreased expression of CD13 expression at the mRNA level (by 42% and 59%, respectively, as compared with the negative control, P<0.05) and the protein level (by 79% and 88%, respectively, as compared with the negative control, P<0.05) (supplementary material Fig. S1), which demonstrates efficient gene silencing. We selected siRNA2 for the following experiments. Mouse chondrocytes were transfected with the negative control siRNA or CD13 siRNA2, then treated with 14-3-3\u03b5 for 24 h to examine MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression. Treatment with 1 \u00b5g/ml 14-3-3\u03b5 increased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-3 by tenfold as compared with the control. The 14-3-3\u03b5-mediated induction of MMP-3 expression and release was significantly inhibited by CD13 siRNA (\u223c66% and \u223c45%, respectively, relative to stimulated controls) (P<0.05; Fig. 2A,B). Similarly, treatment with 14-3-3\u03b5 increased chondrocyte MMP-13 expression and secretion (tenfold and fivefold, respectively, relative to unstimulated controls). The 14-3-3\u03b5-mediated induction of MMP-13 expression and release was significantly decreased by CD13 siRNA (\u223c75% and \u223c23%, respectively, relative to stimulated controls) (P<0.01; Fig. 2C,D). Thus, CD13 knockdown strongly reduced the 14-3-3\u03b5-induced mRNA and protein expression of both MMP-3 and MMP-13, so CD13 might be involved in establishing a catabolic phenotype in murine articular chondrocytes induced by 14-3-3\u03b5.\n",

In mouse chondrocytes, aminopeptidase N activity increased over time, to peak at 60\u201390 min (\u223ctwofold increase versus control); this activity was strongly inhibited by APNi (Fig. 3A).

            "text": "To identify the putative motif(s) on CD13 that could bind to 14-3-3\u03b5, we examined the sequence and structure of CD13 (PDB ID 4FYQ) (Wong et al., 2012). We defined three criteria to identify potential binding site(s). First, we looked for phosphorylated residues, with a preference for a phosphorylated Tyr because previous work has shown that 14-3-3\u03b5 recognizes phosphorylated Ser, Thr or Tyr residues with a marked preference for Tyr (Uhart and Bustos, 2013, 2014). Second, the phosphorylated motif(s) had to be located at a position on the structure of the CD13 protein where they would be accessible to phosphorylation by a Ser, Thr or Tyr kinase, and third, they should belong to a segment able to adopt an extended conformation, because all ligands bound to 14-3-3\u03b5 display an elongated binding mode (Yang et al., 2006; Bustos and Iglesias, 2006). Tyr582 was identified to have these criteria among several other Ser and Thr residues. This unique Tyr residue of the mature protein has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (Hornbeck et al., 2012) and it is the only accessible phosphorylatable residue, as evidenced by the structure of CD13. TyrY582 is part of a long, accessible and elongated loop. In agreement, Y582 inserted in the sequence E579FNYVW584 is flanked by charged or polarized residues that are compatible with the preferred recognition sequence of 14-3-3\u03b5, RSXpSXP (mode 1), where pS is a phosphorylated Ser residue (Obenauer et al., 2003; Yaffe et al., 1997). Y582 was selected for further docking calculations. The EFNYVW was docked in the binding groove of 14-3-3\u03b5 and positioned by analogy with the hexapeptide RQRpSAP complexed to 14-3-3\u03b5. Two orientations (denoted N-ter and C-ter) and two phosphorylation states (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) were tested and compared to the crystal complex. The docking of EFNpYVW with the best scoring energies was found to be oriented in a similar position to that of the solved RQRpSAP ligand, which served as a reference. This complex showed both the lowest total potential energy and the best interaction energy with the protein 14-3-3\u03b5 (\u2212897 and \u22126180 kcal/mol, respectively) (Fig. 7C). In addition, residues of 14-3-3\u03b5, involved in the binding of the crystal peptide, were identified to be involved in the binding of the CD13 hexapeptide fragment. Of note, the groove shows a hydrophobic patch whereby L219, L223 and L230 interact with the hydrophobic facet of the ligand peptide. On the other side of its groove, 14-3-3\u03b5 shows a heavily charged region, composed of K50, K57, R61, R130 and Y131, that is particularly able to accommodate the negatively charged phosphorylated Tyr (Fig. 7A,B). Taken together, these results suggest that the 14-3-3\u03b5 can accommodate the segment E579FNYVW584 of CD13. Nonetheless, larger conformational changes for CD13 and probably for 14-3-3\u03b5 should be investigated to reveal better recognition between the two proteins. Such molecular deciphering at this stage is too unreliable to be computed in silico. Nevertheless, Y582 inserted in the segment, E579FNpYVW584, is a good phosphorylation candidate for 14-3-3\u03b5 recognition and binding.\n",

Several inhibitors of the aminopeptidase N activity were synthesized (Piedfer et al., 2011). We chose an APNi, 2\u2032-3-dinitriflavone-8-acetic-acid, to verify the specificity of this activity in articular chondrocytes. In our experiments, the doses of APNi were adjusted according to the literature and cytotoxicity values obtained after lactate dehydrogenase assay in supernatants of treated chondrocytes. First, we demonstrated the presence of aminopeptidase N activity in articular chondrocytes by using the fluorescent substrate L-alanine \u03b2-naphthylamide. This aminopeptidase N activity was strongly inhibited in chondrocytes in the presence of APNi but not altered after stimulation with 14-3-3\u03b5. These results suggest that the active site of the enzyme might be distinct from the binding site of 14-3-3\u03b5 on CD13. To confirm that, we tested the effect of APNi on 14-3-3\u03b5-mediated MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression. A previous study (Ghaffari et al., 2010) has shown that bestatin (a potent inhibitor of the aminopeptidase N activity) had no effect on the 14-3-3\u03c3-mediated MMP-1 expression. However, our results showed that APNi, used to inhibit the enzyme activity, inhibited also MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression induced by 14-3-3\u03b5 (data not shown). This effect could result from a change in CD13 conformation induced by the binding of the inhibitor to the active site. As a result, 14-3-3\u03b5 could be unable to bind to its binding domain (which would become concealed) to induce the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13. This hypothesis is based on a study (Chen et al., 2012) showing that the binding of a peptide to the active site leads CD13 to convert from an open inactive state to a closed active state.",

These antibodies were tested for specifically recognizing CD13 by western blot analysis. Preliminary experiments showed that AB108310 did not alter the aminopeptidase N enzymatic activity. Similarly, SJ1D1 was shown to be specific to human CD13 without affecting the aminopeptidase enzymatic activity (Piedfer et al., 2011). Thus, the catalytic site is not involved in the inhibitory effect of the anti-CD13 blocking antibody. The decrease in expression and release of MMP-3 and MMP-13, despite stimulation with 14-3-3\u03b5, was indeed due to deletion of the receptor role of CD13 but not its enzymatic activity. Growing evidence suggests that CD13 might have an array of functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity, including its role as a viral receptor (Wong et al., 2012). Similarly, human monocytic aggregation depends on CD13 signal transduction but is independent of its enzymatic activity (Delmas et al., 1994).",

Injection of specific blocking antibody against CD13, and IgG isotype negative and positive controls, demonstrated that the interaction between 14-3-3\u03b5 and CD13 was specific. This direct interaction was confirmed by kinetic tests, although with weaker binding affinity (KD=2.45\u00d710\u22126 M), which might be explained by the absence of some amino acid sequences from recombinant 14-3-3\u03b5 and CD13 used in SPR analysis. Using labeled biotin\u201314-3-3\u03b5, we showed that 14-3-3\u03b5 binds to the surface of chondrocytes in a manner that is dependent on CD13.

The hexapeptide E579FNpYVW584 shows an energy of interaction with 14-3-3\u03b5 in the same range as that displayed by RQRpSAP ligand to 14-3-3\u03b5 in the crystal complex. Indeed, among the variants tested, this ligand shows the highest affinity to 14-3-3\u03b5 in terms of interaction energy computed, that is, when the Tyr582 was phosphorylated. In addition, this segment belongs to an unfolded and accessible loop in CD13. Of note, this region of CD13 is likely more accessible in its open state, as described previously (Mina-Osorio et al., 2006) and modeled by us (data not shown). 14-3-3 proteins can distinguish between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated partners (Bustos, 2012), and many cellular processes are regulated by the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated sites in target proteins (Yasmin et al., 2010). Accordingly, our experimental data reveal an interaction between CD13 and 14-3-3\u03b5 domains, previously predicted by our in silico studies that identify Y582 as a good candidate for phospho-modification. Such binding of 14-3-3\u03b5 to phosphorylated CD13 strongly supports the idea that phosphorylation might regulate CD13 signaling. Moreover, pre-incubation of cells with the mimic peptide EFNpYVW, identified in CD13, which contains a phosphorylation site at Y582, prevents 14-3-3\u03b5 binding to CD13 to induce its catabolic effect. This experiment validates candidate EFNpYVW as the CD13 peptide motif involved in 14-3-3\u03b5 recognition and binding.",

However, no effect of ERK inhibitor on chondrocyte response to 14-3-3\u03b5 was found (supplementary material Fig. S3). Some published reports have demonstrated a link between 14-3-3 proteins and MAPK signaling cascades. It has recently been suggested that the stimulation of cells with 14-3-3\u03b7 leads to the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, but not p38 MAPKs, inducing mediators of inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (Maksymowych et al., 2014). Lam and colleagues have also reported that 14-3-3\u03c3-induced fibroblast MMP-1 expression was mediated through p38 MAPKs and upregulated c-Jun and c-Fos expression (Lam et al., 2005). In addition, CD13 knockdown could block activation of p38 MAPKs in response to 14-3-3\u03c3 stimulation in fibroblasts (Ghaffari et al., 2010). However, anti-CD13 blocking antibodies can inhibit ERK1/2, JNK and p38 phosphorylation (Santos et al., 2000), which suggests a link between CD13 and MAPK pathways. A role for CD13 in signal transduction, independent of its enzymatic activity, has been reported in monocytic cell adhesion (Delmas et al., 1994). However, CD13 possesses a short intracellular domain (seven amino acids) without a signaling motif. Thus, CD13 needs to associate with other proteins to initiate a signaling cascade. Many proteins are found in complex with CD13 including galectin-3, Grb2, Sos, galectin-4 and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (Luan and Xu, 2007). Moreover, Mina-Osorio and colleagues have shown that CD13 interacts with IgG receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) on the surface of monocytic cells (Mina-Osorio and Ortega, 2005), so CD13 transduction might be activated by other receptors.",

Chain A of the solved structure of 14-3-3\u03b5 in complex with the phosphorylated RQRpSAP ligand (PDB ID 2BR9) served as the starting coordinate. The missing atoms of K50 side-chain (lacking electronic density) were completed and the ligand was mutated into EFNYVW by use of the Build module in DiscoveryStudio, Accelrys. Two orientation modes were tested: the N-ter similar to the crystallized ligand N-ter, and the reverse C-ter. In addition, the ligands phosphorylated and not phosphorylated at Y582 were built. All these variants plus the crystal structure of chain A with RQRpSAP, as a reference, were minimized for 5000 iterations by use of the CHARMM force field (Brooks et al., 2009) and the \u2018smart algorithm\u2019 of the energy minimization module in DiscoveryStudio, Accelrys. Then, the energy interaction between the ligand and protein were evaluated in the optimized complexes by use of the interaction energy module in DiscoveryStudio. The analysis of the complexes and images involved use of PyMOL Molecular Graphics System v1.5.",
