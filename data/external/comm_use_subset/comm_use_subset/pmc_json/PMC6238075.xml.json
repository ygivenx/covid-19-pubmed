A Joint External Evaluation tool is available to support planning [13]. A. Oswald, from BMGF,4 recommended balance between affordable vaccines and viable manufacturers investing in large-scale and innovative products, by following each objective separately. There is a need for public organizations to accept higher prices to ensure sustainability. O. Vargas outlined four key principles of the PAHO Revolving Fund for pooled procurement which made immunization in Latin America successful and sustainable: local vaccine legislation, shared goals, solidarity and financial co-responsibility.

Human challenge studies may be needed to advance clinical development. M. Zuma, BioManguinhos, noted that high coverage with a full dose in routine immunization against yellow fever provides the best protection for children, while vaccine used at fractional doses can control outbreaks. S. Desai, Zydus-Cadila, discussed the need to build a comprehensive response to Congo-Crimea hemorrhagic fever, including veterinary and human vaccines and post-exposure treatment. R. Hatchett noted that CEPI is developing agreements with companies to support vaccines\u2019 manufacturing against diseases with epidemic potential, particularly if there is no routine market for such vaccines.

Vaccination of older adults can prevent illnesses resulting from the age-related decline of immune system function [41], [42], [43] as well as consequences of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, innovative solutions are needed to address the challenge of declining vaccination coverage, affecting 25 countries from 2010 to 2015 [44].",
