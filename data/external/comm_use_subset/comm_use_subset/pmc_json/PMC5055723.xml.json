            "text": "Fibrinogen alpha C chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC5.9) is a new serum marker for chronic hepatitis that was discovered in samples from alcoholic liver disease using SELDI-TOF MS [4]. FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and its molecular weight is 5890 Da (Fig. 1a). It has been established that the level of FIC5.9 is high in healthy people and low with onset of hepatitis [5\u20137]. We developed an ELISA system for FIC5.9 and evaluated the clinical utility of FIC5.9 in various kinds of chronic hepatitis [8]. The results showed that the serum level of FIC5.9 is significantly decreased in the early stage of liver fibrosis and showed a strong indicator for liver fibrosis. We also found that natural FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is negligible in the blood circulation of healthy subjects, but clearly detected in the serum collection tubes, thus we concluded that FIC5.9 is released from fibrinogen during the process of blood coagulation [8]. That is, FIC5.9 is an in vitro product that is released during blood clotting from fibrinogen (Fig. 1b). Since our initial identification of FIC5.9, the same peptide (if not identified completely, but with the completely same mass) has been reported as a biomarker in several pathological conditions, including cancers and inflammatory disorders [9\u201314]. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unknown.\n",

Especially we focused on the coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. FIC5.9 sequence includes amino acids 576\u2013629 of the fibrinogen alpha chain (Fig. 2) and FIC5.9 appears to be synthesized by cleavage at RGK/SSS (N-terminal region) and RPV/RGI (C-terminal region) [4]. Coagulation and fibrinolysis factor, thrombin and plasmin are major enzymes that cleave to the carboxyl side of lysine work with fibrinogen or fibrin [15]. There are fewer reports of enzymes in blood that cleave to the carboxyl side of valine, but neutrophil elastase is one of such example [16]. In this study, as a first step toward understanding the mechanisms of FIC5.9 changes in various pathologies, we tested the hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by these enzymes in apparently healthy subjects.\n",

Deficiency of factor II, V, VIII and X decreased the FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen (Additional file 1), and that factor II (thrombin) had a particularly marked effect on the releasing of FIC5.9 from fibrinogen. We reconfirmed that FIC5.9 is released in the serum collection tube during blood clotting. To determine the coagulation and fibrinolysis factors responsible to release FIC5.9, we narrowed down the candidate enzymes based on these results. Information of enzyme cleavage sites was obtained from the Peptidase Database (MEROPS: http://merops.sanger.ac.uk. Accessed 21 September 2013). and we finally choose thrombin, plasmin, and neutrophil elastase [17\u201319]. We degraded purified fibrinogen with these enzymes and the sequences of degradation products were analyzed by LC\u2013MS/MS (Fig. 3; Additional file 2). Our degradation conditions showed that several cleavage sites are found in fibrinogen alpha C terminal domain, but especially the N-terminal region of FIC5.9 (RGK/SSS) was cleaved by thrombin or plasmin, and the C-terminal region of FIC5.9 (RPV/RGI) was cleaved by neutrophil elastase. While we tried fibrinogen digestion experiment, using thrombin, plasmin, neutrophil elastase, and their mixture, we could not form FIC5.9 itself from fibrinogen, but observed its fragments in vitro (data not shown).\n",

It is clear that blood clotting initiates FIC5.9 releasing, and FIC5.9 is negligible in the blood circulation, but found in serum collection tubes.

While thinking thrombin is an initiation element of FIC5.9 releasing, these results indicate that plasmin is the major enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal region of FIC5.9 and affects the amount of FIC5.9. In nature, activation of plasminogen to plasmin occurs after activation of coagulation factors including thrombin [22, 23]. These reports also support the role of thrombin as the initiator of FIC5.9 synthesis. Inhibition of plasmin activity significantly suppressed FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen (Fig. 4). The suppression of plasmin by tranexamic acid was significant, but not completely. It may be due to other enzymes which can cleave the N-terminal end of FIC5.9; in fact, our in vitro digestion experiments (Fig. 3) show thrombin can cleave N-terminal end of FIC5.9. Taken together, plasmin seems to play a main role in cleaving N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and releasing FIC5.9.",

Therefore, the C-terminal site of FIC5.9 is likely to be cleaved at a similar level in healthy people and patients with chronic hepatitis. However, an extreme increase or decrease in neutrophils might affect FIC5.9 releasing. A spike test of neutrophil elastase into the collection tube could not be performed because we could not obtain enough amount of elastase. Indeed, significant volume of enzyme was needed for experiment with blood collection tubes.

            "text": "The presence of other factors related to FIC5.9 releasing should also be considered. Recently, Marfa et al. reported that TGF-\u03b2 reduces the expression level of fibrinogen alpha chain mRNA [7], which is of note because the level of TGF-\u03b2 is related to liver fibrosis and hepatitis [31, 32]. In addition, plasma fibrinogen has been proposed as a marker for chronic liver disease [33]. As these reports show, the low level of FIC5.9 releasing in chronic hepatitis is not simply due to enzymatic reactions, but also to a decrease in fibrinogen synthesis (a decrease in the precursor to FIC5.9). Thus, it seems that several factors are involved in determining the level of FIC5.9.",

Most coagulation and fibrinolysis factors are unstable for measurement of activity [36\u201338], as exemplified by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the prothrombin time (PT). FIC5.9 is also a degradation product from fibrinogen alpha chain that is released by coagulation and fibrinolysis factors, and reflects a minute change in these factors. Thrombin, plasmin and neutrophil elastase are involved in the key mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing in clotting of normal blood. This provides the basis for understanding the decrease in FIC5.9 in clotting of blood from patients with chronic hepatitis. Further analysis may show similar effects in blood from patients with several diseases.",
