            "text": "Infectious diseases of livestock have consequences for animal production as well as animal health and welfare. The transboundary animal diseases (TAD:s) are also a concern for international trade [1,2] and outbreaks of such diseases may cause enormous losses for society as a whole [3]. For the individual farmer, endemic diseases are usually of more interest, as these diseases have a higher impact on everyday production. Transmission between herds occurs via direct (live animal movements) as well as indirect (via physical vectors such as, people, transport vehicles and fomites) contacts [4]. Transmission via live animals represents the highest risk as moving an infected animal also moves the infection, but other routes of transmission are also important, as has been seen in various disease outbreaks [5,6]. The risk posed by each contact between farms depends on disease prevalence and the biosecurity measures taken to reduce the risk. There is spatial variation in many risk factors for endemic diseases. The density of the susceptible species can also be reflected in the geographical distribution of a specific disease [7,8] and a high animal density is often regarded as a risk factor for contagious diseases. There are also other geographical influences, as is seen in for example the prevalence of Coxiella burnettii [9] and verotoxin producing Escherichia coli in Swedish cattle herds [9] and Salmonella Dublin in Denmark, United Kingdom and Sweden [9-11]. The geographical risk reflects various transmission routes that occur more frequently in the local environment [12]. This is taken into account in the restriction zones laid down around infected premises in most disease control plans for TAD:s, such as e.g. African swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease [13,14]. Insight into the geographical patterns of between-farm contacts is therefore important for exotic disease control. Some contact patterns can be associated with the prevalence of endemic diseases and may be used for assessing the risk for individual farms as regards endemic diseases [15,16]. Biosecurity measures are essential for risk reduction and the application of such measures has been studied in various European countries [17-19], including Sweden [20,21]. The registration of livestock movements is mandatory in the European Union [22-24] and patterns of such movements have been studied in different EU member states e.g. UK and Sweden [25,26]. Other contact patterns between farms are however less studied as such movements are rarely registered centrally, but the frequency of various contacts on farm level has been studied [27,28]. To our knowledge, a geographical representation of actual indirect contacts between Swedish animal holdings has not been demonstrated. For the Swedish situation, assessing the geographical patterns of indirect contacts between farms has been one of the missing pieces of information in order to gain insight into the overall contact pattern between livestock holdings and the risk presented by these contacts. The aim of this study was to fill that knowledge gap.",

The average herd sizes were: 70 dairy cows, 17 beef cows, 186 sows, 765 fattening pigs and 32 adult sheep. The highest density of cattle is in the southwest of the country, where the counties V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland and Sk\u00e5ne have approximately 0.15 holdings/km2 and 0.22 holdings/km2, respectively. The lowest density of cattle is found in the northern third of the country, where Norrbotten in the far north has the lowest density (0.002 holdings/km2) and V\u00e4sterbotten has the highest density (0.01 holdings/km2) of the northern counties. The county of S\u00f6dermanland lies somewhere in between with a cattle density of 0.09 holdings/km2 and a pig density of 0.01 holdings/km2). The highest density of pig holdings can be found in Sk\u00e5ne (0.06/km2), while V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland has 0.016/km2 and V\u00e4sterbotten only 0.001/km2. Sheep are more evenly distributed but most holdings are found in the southern half of the country. The density of sheep holdings is around 0.06/km2 in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, Sk\u00e5ne and S\u00f6dermanland, but only 0.004/km2 in V\u00e4sterbotten.",

However, the drivers varied (both over the year and over the day, as milk tanker drivers tend to work in shifts) and the same vehicle could be running different routes. Some dairy companies also provided data on individual milk tanker drivers. From this data it was clear that drivers may be on different routes and therefore visiting farms in a much larger area. Data provided from V\u00e4sterbotten exemplified this, where one driver travelled in one week in January 2013 over an area of 25,112 km2. This is 1,600 km2 larger than the greatest area travelled by any single vehicle in the study.",

In contrast to the other groups in this study, drivers do not always return to a point of origin each day but may be required to sleep in or near their vehicle. Thus, they may travel long distances and over large areas in a week, as seen in Figures 6 and 2. While some vehicles in this study visited a very small number of farms in a week and travelled over weekly distances as short as 2 km, others could cover weekly areas as large as 48,134 km2. Even in a 24 h time span, a single vehicle in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland travelled over an area of 33,452 km2.

While milk tankers can mostly be relied upon to visit a set number of farms, livestock hauliers cannot. The trend seems to be that larger areas and a smaller number of farms are visited per week and per day in the north. However, exceptions occur, which is important to keep in mind. There were also clear variations within the regions, especially as regards veterinarians. Generally, the professions travelling across the greatest areas were milk tanker drivers and livestock hauliers, and the profession travelling over the smallest areas was, as a rule, the veterinarians. Although general conclusions about movement patterns of different professional categories are hampered by the limited data, the study clearly demonstrates that individual movements outside the general patterns may occur. Some of the heterogeneities might have been reduced in a larger and more comprehensive dataset, allowing for a better overall picture. However, the observed variations are of interest and indicate the need for detailed contact tracing in all disease outbreaks.",

A disease might therefore not spread as rapidly as in some of the more densely populated areas of the country, although there are other factors affecting this risk.

The biosecurity of both farms and professional visitors play an important part in the protection against infectious animal diseases [4-6].
