On presentation, she was febrile to 40\u00b0C, and the chest radiograph showed right lower lobe pneumonia (Figure \n1, CXR from 27-Nov-2013)). She was initially admitted to the medical ward (day 1), but condition rapidly deteriorated requiring ICU admission and intubation on day 3. Right-sided pigtail catheter was inserted for right exudative pleural effusion. She was treated as community-acquired pneumonia. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ventilation became difficult despite high level of ventilatory support and prone position. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started, and she was retrieved to a local center with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO) for further care on day 4.",

In severe cases, point-of-care lung ultrasound may lead to efficient allocation of resources such as respiratory isolation rooms, ventilatory support, and ECMO. It is unclear if different virus types (e.g., H7N9 vs. H5N1 vs. H1N1 vs. RSV) manifest different patterns in viral lung ultrasonographic findings (relative numbers of B lines, confluent B lines, and small subpleural consolidations). Further investigation into these ultrasound patterns may allow distinguishing between different virus types on the basis of ultrasonographic findings\n[18]. Autopsies of patients with influenza A (H5N1) virus infection have \u2018shown diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and pulmonary congestion with varying degrees of hemorrhage\u2019\n[19]. Our second patient had similar findings on postmortem examination (Figure \n3). We speculate that these interstitial infiltrates and pulmonary congestion would appear on ultrasound as B lines or confluent B lines (or white lung), with hemorrhage appearing as small subpleural consolidations similar to that observed in our cases and in other viruses.",

With reported median lung ultrasound exam times of 6 min\n[4], point-of-care ultrasound can be used to reduce ED congestion and is scalable by increasing numbers of portable ultrasound units with clinicians capable of performing lung ultrasound. For patients too critically ill to be transported for CT scan, point-of-care ultrasound is a feasible imaging alternative\n[8]. A greater concern when evaluating children who are at risk for higher mortality from avian influenza A (H5N1) infection\n[19] is that ultrasonography avoids radiation exposure that elevates future cancer risk when using chest X-ray or CT scan\n[20,21].",
