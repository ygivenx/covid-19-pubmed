However, there is also a potential that over-use or abuse of a new antibiotic will give rise to more antibiotic-resistance bacteria. Growing difficulties from the discovery of new antibiotics to their clinical use have diverted attentions to a new therapeutic agent, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [2].",

The expression cassettes of the vector were designed to be surrounded by flanking sequences, allowing the cassettes to be integrated into the chloroplast genome via double homologous recombination. Moreover, the copy number of the transgene in chloroplasts can be multiplied up to 10,000 per single plant cell [22, 23], leading to high expression of the transgene.",

However, the tags need to be removed prior to clinical use. The final product needs to be an authentic or native amino acid sequence, so a cleavage recognition site should be placed between the therapeutic peptide and the tag. However, the removal of tag proteins at the cleavage site is often sterically hindered, and the cleavage action by proteases such as factor Xa, enterokinase, thrombin and tobacco etch virus protease, is often non-specific [24]. Unlike proteases that recognize linear amino acid sequences, the SUMO protease (sumoase) recognizes the tertiary structure of SUMO and prevents erroneous cleavage events in the target protein [24\u201326].",

The integration region is transcriptionally active and has been widely used for high expression of transgenes [36, 37].

Also, a 6xHis purification tag was added to the N-terminus of SUMO to facilitate the purification of the SUMO-fused abaecin, and to isolate abaecin from SUMO after cleavage by sumoase. Three different combinations of codon-optimized synthetic sequences of the 6xHisSUMO-abaecin were cloned into the new vector, and their expression in an E. coli system was investigated after the confirmation of their sequences (Fig. 1a, b and Additional file 1: Figure S1). For the codon optimization, codon adjustment was performed according to a previous study [33], in which a new algorithm for codon optimization was developed based on the codon usage hierarchy of chloroplast psbA genes, and the codon-optimized sequences under the control of psbA/5\u2019 UTR showed increased expression levels over their respective native sequences in both E. coli and plant chloroplasts. The expressions of all the three fusion constructs didn\u2019t show any toxicity to host cells. As shown in Fig. 1c, there was no significant difference of optical density (OD) values between untransformed and transformed cells with the three fusion constructs, which were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C.",

Transformed E. coli cells with the three constructs were grown in liquid culture and the relative expression levels between the three fusion proteins were examined using an immunoblot assay with anti-His antibody. The expressed fusion proteins were detected around 20 kDa, not at 15.7 kDa which is a deduced molecular weight (Fig. 2a). This kind of discrepancy is very often observed in proline-rich proteins expressed in E. coli, due to presumably increased rigidity caused by high proline content, leading to slower migration than the same molecular weight protein [38\u201341]. Abaecin (3.9 kDa, 34 amino acids) contains 10 prolines in total of 34 amino acids, accounting for 34.9%, so it is assumed that the high content of proline residues affected the migration of all three fusion proteins (136 amino acids in length for each construct). Among three fusion proteins, 6xHisSUMO (N)-abaecin (C) (N and C, stand for \u201cnative sequence\u201d and \u201ccodon-optimized sequence\u201d, respectively) showed the highest expression, with 2.8 or 3.5 fold higher expression than 6xHisSUMO(C)-abaecin (N) or 6xHisSUMO(C)-abaecin(C), respectively (Fig. 2b).

The abaecin cleaved by sumoase was examined by MALDI-TOF analysis to verify the precise cleavage between SUMO and abaecin. Singly protonated molecular ion (M + H) + of the cleaved-off abaecin was observed at m/z 3245.034 Da using reflector mode (Fig. 3a), while the theoretical molecular mass is 3877.049 Da (Fig. 3b). This discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values suggests the possibility of deletion of abaecin peptide at either N- or C- termini. To identify the peptide peak, we calculated the masses for a series of deleted abaecin peptides from either N- or C-termini and compared the theoretical masses to the observed mass (Fig. 3b) The best amino acid sequence corresponding to the observed mass at 3245.034 Da was deduced as YVPLPNVPQPGRRPFPTFPGQGPFNPKIK, which indicates the deletion of 5 amino acids from C-terminus of abaecin (Fig. 3b).

The antimicrobial activity of 29-aa abaecin was enhanced in a combination treatment with cecropin B. No antimicrobial activity was observed by cecropin B when 0.125 \u03bcg of the peptide was treated (Fig. 4a, b), however, the antimicrobial activity of abaecin, at the dose of 1.7 \u03bcg, was increased by 40% when combined with the cecropin B (0.125 \u03bcg) (Fig. 4a, b). The antibacterial activity of abaecin was further enhanced by the increase of cecropin B quantity up to 0.25 \u03bcg (Fig. 4a, b). These results are consistent with the previous reports that the functional interaction of abaecin with other pore-forming peptides, such as cecropin A, stomoxyn and hymenoptaecin, at their sublethal concentrations, reciprocally potentiates bacteriolytic activity by increasing membrane permeabilization [13, 31, 43].",

The commonly used fusion carriers such as thioredoxin (12 kDa) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST, 26 kDa) have several advantages associated with increased solubility, promotion of proper folding and prevention of toxicity of AMPs [9, 46, 47]. However, GST increases the relative molecular weight ratio of carrier proteins to the peptides, which leads to low AMP yields. Also, several GST fused-AMPs expressed in E.coli showed proteolytic activity, resulting in inefficient or failed AMP productions. Thioredoxin is more favorably used for peptide production than the GST due to its small size, allowing high peptide yield attributed to the high peptide-to-carrier ratio [47]. However, the proteases used for the release of attached peptides from the carriers are more expensive and more sensitive to pH and chaotropes when compared to SUMO protease [47]. Moreover, AMPs tagged to aggregation-promoting carriers such as PurF fragment, PaP3:30 and ketosteroid isomerase have shown toxicity to host bacterial cells [9, 48].",

In contrast to our expectation, the attached SUMO tag (overall charge \u2212 5) didn\u2019t protect the abaecin (overall charge + 4, Fig. 3b) via electrostatic interaction from endogenous proteases in an E.coli system. Small size peptides with high cationic content are highly susceptible to proteolytic attack in E.coli as shown in Piers et al.\u2019s study [10]. In the study, direct expression of small size cationic peptide such as human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP-1, a kind of defensin) wasn\u2019t successful, while its transcript was detected. Even when the HNP-1 and other cationic peptide, synthetic cecropin/melittin hybrid (CEME), were fused to GST, the fusion proteins were proteolyzed. However, the proteolysis wasn\u2019t observed when anionic pre-pro defensin sequence was inserted between the GST and the cationic peptides. Based on our analysis, a positively charged patch created by two Arg (R) at 12th and 13th positions (Fig. 3b) seemed to not be recognized by endogenous proteases possibly due to charge neutralization effect by the electrostatic interaction with SUMO, while the second patch created by two Lys (K) at 28th and 30th positions (Fig. 3b) seemed subjected to proteolytic attack. Another possibility of the C-terminal deletion could be a consequence of excessive sonication, resulting in denaturation of the fusion protein and breakdown at the C-terminus. Also, it can\u2019t be ruled out that the sumoase could aberrantly cleave the abaecin. It is thought that sumoase is highly specific and active in a broad range of conditions; it cleaves effectively in a wide range of pH (5.5\u201310.5) and temperatures (4\u201337 \u00b0C), and even in detergents such as 2 M urea or 20 mM DTT or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol [25]. However, the cleavage study at the junction between SUMO and a partner protein showed that the cleavage didn\u2019t work when the first amino acid of the partner protein was Pro (P) [25]. Also, the introduction of a stretch of several Try (W) residues close to the cleavage site caused random cleavage within the fusion protein due to an inaccessibility of sumoase by steric hindrance, which, however, was relieved by addition of 1 M urea and led to the release of correct size peptide [26]. Considering the high content of proline in abaecin, the repeated kinks generated by 10 prolines in the abaecin could create a steric hindrance when attached to SUMO, which would lead an unexpected random cleavage. To investigate these issues mentioned above, SUMO could be further modified in a way which introduces additional glycine resides at the cleavage junction to release steric hindrance. In our unpublished study, cleavage of SUMO-cecropin B at the junction by sumoase happened only after introduction of additional glycine residues. Also, genetically modified SUMO which has more negative charge could provide a better protection to cationic peptides.",

Furthermore, the bacteriolytic activities were consistent with previous reports in which the antimicrobial activity of abaecin alone was further enhanced with combinatory treatment with other pore-forming AMPs [31, 43]. Although abaecin has high binding efficacy to DnaK like other proline-rich DnaK-binding AMPs including metalnikowins, metchnikowins, onocin Onc72, apidaecin Api88, drosocin and pyrrhocoricin, the abaecin hasn\u2019t a conserved motif, YL/IPRP [43]. So we analyzed both abaecin amino acid sequences such as 34-aa and 29-aa-long abaecins for the functional binding sequence to DnaK using limbo server and found that the full length abaecin has two binding sequence sites: one is at N-terminus (1YVPLPNV7, score 1.7) and the other one is at C-terminus (25NPKIKWP31, score 2.8). So we assume that the reason why the 29-aa long abaecin still has antimicrobial activity (Fig. 4) is due to the presence of N-terminal binding sequence to DnaK (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "The main purpose of this study was to introduce a new expression platform for the production of antimicrobial peptides in E.coli system in a way that does not harm the host cell. Abaecin was chosen as a reference AMP because it targets the intracellular molecule DnaK, prokaryotic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and the binding of abaecin to DnaK can cause protein metabolism to be compromised in E. coli, resulting in host cell death [43]. The 6xHisSUMO-abaecin fusion protein, however, did not exhibit toxicity to E. coli host cells. The transformed E. coli cells grew in liquid culture at the similar growth rate to untransformed ones (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the purified fusion protein showed no anti-bactericidal activity against B. subtilis (Fig. 4a, b). The normal growth of the transformed E. coli and the lack of antimicrobial activity of the fusion protein to B. subtilis proved that the lethal activity of the AMP to the host cells can be properly shielded by SUMO but its activity can be restored by the release from the tag. The antimicrobial activity of AMPs is generally determined by the hydrophobicity and the net positive charge. As reported in the previous study, the electrostatic interactions between the positive charges (between + 4 and + 6) of AMPs and negatively charge residues within SUMO (overall charge \u2212 5) seem to play a key role in neutralizing the bacteriolytic activity and protecting AMPs from degradation by endogenous proteases [26]. In this regard, although the protection of abaecin from proteolytic degradation by SUMO failed, the C-terminal deleted abaecin still had antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, the toxicity of abaecin was, in some way, successfully prevented by the SUMO tag via the presumed electrostatic interaction.",

To achieve and maintain their active forms, such proteins need to be redirected to periplasmic space or secreted, which are energy-consuming and could potentially lower target protein yield.

There have been many reports that SUMO fusions increased the solubility of difficult-to-express proteins in E.coli, such as GFP, metalloprotease (MMP13) [25] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) proteins including 3CL protease, nucleocapsid protein and spike C protein [49, 50]. However, in contrast to antimicrobial peptides, those proteins are not toxic to the host cells. To conclusively distinguish the effect of SUMO on the solubility of the fusion protein, the expression of abaecin alone would need to be compared with SUMO-abaecin fusion protein, which, however, was not examined in this study due to technical issues such as possible low stability and potential toxicity to host cells. As mentioned above, the direct expression of the small size and high cationic content of AMPs are highly susceptible to endogenous proteolysis [10]. Furthermore, the expression of abaecin alone could be lethal to host cells because the peptide inhibits intracellular DnaK [43], which is a central organizer of the chaperone network in E.coli. The chaperone protein interacts with ~ 700 cytosolic proteins. Among them, ~ 180 proteins are relatively prone to be aggregation and rely extensively on DnaK during and after their initial folding [51].",

Codon usage was adjusted according to the codon usage preference of a gene, psbA, which is highly expressed in prokaryotic systems, and then three different combinations of codon-optimzed sequences were created. The codon adjustment was performed in a way to increase the compatibility between 5\u2019 UTR of the psbA promoter and the 5\u2032 coding region of the fusion gene, with an increase of AT content of the SUMO sequence to 63.5% from 59.5%. In contrast to our expectation, the codon optimization of N-terminal SUMO of the fusion protein failed to improve the expression level over the non-optimized counterpart. As seen in the Fig. 2a, b, the native sequence of SUMO performed better than its corresponding codon-optimized sequence for the expression of the fusion proteins. The expression level of 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (native \u2013 codon-optimized) was 2.8 or 3.5 times higher than that of 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (codon-optimized - native) or 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (codon-optimized \u2013 codon-optimized), respectively (Fig. 2b). This is likely due to the stability of the transcribed mRNA of the native SUMO sequence, which may be relatively higher than the stability of other codon-optimized sequences [52]. Another possible explanation is that the compatibility of the 5\u2019 UTR of the promoter with the 5\u2032 coding sequence of the codon-optimized SUMO could be compromised, resulting in an unstable or inefficient translational initiation complex [53, 54]. It is generally thought that translational efficiency is influenced by the efficiency of the formation of translational initiation complex and thus the first ~ 30\u201350 codons are considered more important than the rest of the sequence [55, 56]. Therefore, the marginal difference of expression level between codon-optimized SUMO fused native and codon-optimized abaecins could be a conseqeunce of the inefficient formation of the translational initiation complex.",

Pores created in the membrane by the pore-forming peptide allow abaecin to access its intracellular target, DnaK. The inhibited heat shock proteins compromise protein metabolism, and the damaged pores remain unrepaired, thus allowing abaecin even greater access to its target. Abaecin\u2019s ability to increase membrane permeabilization consequently reduces the minimal inhibitory concentrations of both abaecin and other pore-forming peptides in a reciprocal manner [31, 43]. Likewise, the activity of the pore-forming peptide cecropin B from Hyalophora cecropia was potentiated in a combinatorial treatment with abaecin (Fig. 4), showing that abaecin can be used with diverse pore-forming peptides to inhibit bacteria which are renitent to conventional antibiotics.",

Currently, most AMPs under clinical development are designed to target local infections using a topical formulation. Only a few AMPs are being developed for systemic delivery [45]. Although an oral delivery system is most likely preferred due to straightforward administration, AMPs require special consideration because peptides are rapidly broken down in the gastrointestinal tracts due to the high concentration of proteases and high acidity. In this respect, edible plants can be used as a delivery platform, by which peptide based drugs bioencapsulated within the plant cells can be protected from the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. But the drugs can be released into the intestine by the break-down of the cell walls by cellulolytic bacteria. The plant expression and delivery system can also eliminate the concern of endotoxin contamination, which causes fatal septic shock to recipients. Furthermore, the oral delivery of peptides by edible plant cells eliminates the need for expensive downstream purifications, reducing product cost and benefiting patients [18, 20, 21]. In our future study, we will evaluate the efficacy of the plant expression system as well.",
