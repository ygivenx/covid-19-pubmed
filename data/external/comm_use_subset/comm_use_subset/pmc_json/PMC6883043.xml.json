            "text": "The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France1. The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms2. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims3. Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens3\u20137. The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae)3. However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus8,9, of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice10\u201312 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory.",

We have no explanation for this unexpected observation. Older age (\u226560 years) was associated with the acquisition of influenza viruses, HCoV and S. pneumoniae. Although older age was not correlated with the increase in the proportion of respiratory symptoms in our study, our results support the current French recommendations that indicate influenza vaccination for all pilgrims and IPD vaccination for pilgrims aged \u226560 years old (or with chronic conditions)24,25. Furthermore, we showed that influenza vaccination was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of ILI in our survey. Similarly, in a meta-analysis, Alfelali et al. have shown that, influenza vaccine decreases the prevalence of ILI26. We also demonstrate here that vaccination against IPD with a decrease in the acquisition of S. pneumoniae, but had no effect on respiratory symptoms. A protective effect of pneumococcal vaccination against S. pneumoniae post-Hajj carriage was observed in only one out of 5 studies so far9. However, all studies showing no effect of pneumococcal vaccination were conducted on small groups of pilgrims (ranging 55 to 107 individuals), while in the two studies showing a protective effect, the number of pilgrims was much higher (1178 and 468) which may indicate that small surveys lacked statistical power. Finally, as expected, patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases were more likely to suffer from cough and ILI but also to acquire H. influenzae. Our results confirm the need for influenza and IPD vaccination among the identified pilgrim populations at risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Vaccination rates in our cohort were clearly sub-optimal: 26.7% of pilgrims were vaccinated against influenza and 30.5% against IPD among those with an indication.",

In a meta-analysis including 13 surveys of Hajj pilgrims, significant protection of face masks was found against RITs, but the end points varied considerably12. We found that there was a higher prevalence of ILI and rhinovirus acquisition among pilgrims who reported wearing face masks. Similarly, a higher prevalence of cough was observed among pilgrims who reported using disposable handkerchiefs. It is likely that such results indicate the higher willingness of symptomatic pilgrims to wear a face mask and use disposable handkerchiefs, with the aim of avoiding spreading diseases. In addition, the use of disposable handkerchiefs appears to be correlated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus carriage, which may reflect a better elimination of organisms by cleaning the nasopharynx. We found that increased hand hygiene was not associated with reduced respiratory pathogens acquisition or a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms. In a recent review paper, it was shown that while hand hygiene using non-alcoholic products was generally well accepted by Hajj pilgrims, there was no conclusive evidence of its effectiveness, which is consistent with our results11.",

Many studies showed that S. aureus and rhinovirus were among the predominant pathogens isolated from the Hajj pilgrims suffering RTIs9,11,12,21,23\u201332. Most cases of infections due to HRV are benign, self-limited cold-like illnesses.

HRV spreads mostly via direct contact or contact with a fomite, with inoculation to the eye or nose from fingertips34.
