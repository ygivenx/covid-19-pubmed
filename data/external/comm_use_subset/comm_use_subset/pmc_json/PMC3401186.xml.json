The ability of H1N1pdm viruses to infect the lower respiratory track has been attributed to a broader specificity in the binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to \u03b12-3- in addition to \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors [7], [8]. It is reasonable that the lung tropism of the H1N1pdm contributed to the severity of disease in those individuals with preexisting complications such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6], [9]\u2013[12]. Data from limited human autopsies and animal studies of various pandemic strains also suggest contribution of the host innate immune response and the virus in the progression of disease [13]\u2013[16].",

To explore the potential utility of molecular imaging in influenza infection, we chose the ferret (Mustela putorius furo) model. Ferrets have been used as an animal model of influenza infection and pathogenesis since 1934, when they were reported to develop an acute respiratory tract illness when exposed to influenza viruses from humans and swine [19]. In contrast to mice, the ferret can be infected by human isolates without adaptation and display signs and symptoms of infection such as sneezing and nasal secretions that are similar to what is seen in humans [20]\u2013[23]. The ferret is an attractive model for imaging influenza pulmonary infections given the ferret\u2019s long trachea, large lung capacity, and bronchiolar branching. These anatomical features can potentially bridge imaging with histopathologic evaluation. Finally, the ferret more closely mimics humans in distribution of sialic acid (SA) receptors in the respiratory tract with higher \u03b1-2-6 SA in the upper respiratory tract and SA with \u03b1-2-3- in the lower [24].",

            "text": "Historically, plain film (x-ray) radiography and computed tomography (CT) have been useful for clinical assessments of influenza disease severity in clinical cases [25], [26]. These imaging modalities are limited by characterizing only anatomic changes in the lung parenchyma, such as ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidations, which represent different degrees of interstitial and alveolar filling by cells, edema, and inflammatory exudate [27]. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radiotracer, [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG), can provide data on metabolic activity of cells by measuring sites of increased glycolysis from leukocyte chemotaxis and accumulation, and provide increased sensitivity in detection of cells during inflammation. [18F]-FDG, an analog of glucose that is moved into cells via facilitated transport, is commonly used in PET imaging as a radiotracer in clinical and basic science research. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of the [18F]-FDG in assessment of infectious disease burden in animal models of schistosomiasis and tuberculosis [28]\u2013[30]. PET/CT has been used in the assessment of one hospitalized H1N1pdm patient and revealed an intense inflammatory response [31]. The uptake of [18F]-FDG in humans and animals suggests the predominant presence of activated neutrophils [32]\u2013[35]. In studies of mice infected with influenza A virus, neutrophils play a critical role in protection and recovery from infection, and participate in the process of adaptive immunity to the virus [36]. Coupled with molecular virology and pathology, molecular imaging with important probes of disease has enormous potential to reveal early critical factors that contribute to the clinical progression of illness as well as accelerate screening, the efficacy and mechanistic studies of vaccines and antiviral therapies [17], [18].",

Further, for these studies we chose a low passage clinical isolate, A/Kentucky/180/2010 or KY/180, herein, which has a change in the HA1 gene, D222G, which correlates with increased severity of disease in patient cases from several countries [37]\u2013[40]. In mice, infection with H1N1pdm engineered to include this change show increased viral titers and pathology, however, in ferrets there do not seem to be any major differences in clinical signs, transmissibility or pathogenicity [41], [42]. Our results show for the first time, the spatiotemporal progression of inflammation with CT and PET using [18F]-FDG in ferrets infected with H1N1pdm in conjunction with histopathology and viral titers over a seven day period. Importantly, the extensive areas of patchy GGO and consolidation seen in the ferret model at 6 days post-infection (DPI) are similar to that reported for human H1N1pdm infections [31]. In vivo imaging with these modalities for anatomic (CT) and molecular (PET) data suggests increased pulmonary inflammation as the amount of circulating virus becomes undetectable. These results suggest that molecular imaging will be a great asset in gaining insight into the temporal and spatial progression of the inflammatory process caused by influenza virus infection.",

The pandemic H1N1 isolate KY/180 employed in these studies was isolated from nasal swab sample provided by the Severe Influenza Pneumonia Surveillance project, a clinical study of hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia in Kentucky. The patient had a severe course of influenza disease and died after 19 days. Sequencing of the HA1 gene from this isolate revealed the D222G mutation, which has been associated with severe disease in human cases [37]\u2013[40]. The second passage of the KY/180 seed was employed in the characterization of infection in the female ferrets. The 50% infectious dose in female ferrets was determined to be 100.07 TCID50 (data not shown). In group 1, six ferrets were mock infected with PBS. In group 2, six ferrets were infected intranasally (i.n.) with KY/180 with a 0.5 ml dose of 0.5\u00d7105.7 TCID50 per naris. Ferrets were monitored for temperature for 10 DPI, and for body weight and clinical symptoms for 28 DPI.

Specifically, more extensive infiltration of neutrophils can be seen within the bronchiolar lumen, along with necrosupprative bronchiolitis and mixed cell alveolitis. At Day 7, lesions observed in the lung lobes continued to exhibit an increased severity compared to the majority of lung lesions seen at 1 and 2 DPI. Bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia and cytokaryomegaly were noted in addition to bronchiolitis.",

We chose a low passage clinical isolate, KY/180, which has a change in the HA1 gene, D222G. The D222G change in H1N1pdm correlates with increased severity of disease in patient cases from several countries [37]\u2013[40]. The patient from which we obtained the KY/180 isolate also had a severe course of influenza illness over a period of 19 days that resulted in death. Recently, studies in mice and ferrets infected with pandemic influenza viruses A/California/04/2009 and A/Netherlands/602/2009 engineered with the D222G mutation have shown that the D222G mutation are lethal in mice, but not ferret [41], [42]. The lethality in mice, but not ferrets, has been attributed to the greater abundance of \u03b12-3-SA in the mouse model [42], [43]. All of these viruses have an affinity for \u03b12,6-SAs associated with attachment to and replication in cells of the upper respiratory tract as shown by the high levels of viral replication in the nasal turbinates. Thus, infection of ferrets with these H1N1pdm isolates engineered with D222G and our clinical isolate have not correlated with clinical findings in patients. These results in ferrets are not surprising given that 80% of the fatal cases of H1N1pdm had underlying medical conditions and bacterial infections [6]. Discovery of the molecular components of the host response that may promote pathogenesis will be critical for defining new treatments.",

Recently, Veldhuis Kroeze et al, presented data on the monitoring of pulmonary lesions of H1N1pdm influenza virus-infected ferrets with CT scanning which correlated with disease progression and severity [44]. As those studies demonstrate, CT is a powerful tool, but it will not give the molecular details that can be provided by PET or SPECT imaging of probes that target critical host responses such as neutrophil invasion. In our study we coupled CT scanning with the [18F]-FDG radiotracer and show infection and inflammation of influenza infection in the lower respiratory system with foci of increased [18F]-FDG uptake corresponding to areas of lung opacity on CT, with underlying inflammation on necropsy. In comparison to human CT imaging studies of influenza, the molecular images in the ferret show strong similarity. CT findings in patients with confirmed influenza infection show patchy ground-glass opacities in segmental multifocal distributions, mixed with areas of consolidation in the lung [12], [25], [45]. Moreover, the few case reports of human influenza in which lungs were imaged by [18F]-FDG PET demonstrate areas of high uptake in these ground-glass opacities and consolidation [31]. Our study similarly demonstrates this pattern in the ferret model, also showing patchy opacities on CT with high uptake of radiotracer on PET, with necroscopy-based confirmation of inflammation in the left caudal lobe. Specifically, we show the ferret lung demonstrated progressive consolidation on CT and FDG uptake on PET predominantly in the right caudal lobe, which progressed to the left caudal lobe by day 3 p.i. By day 6, the diffuse metabolically active lesions seen on PET/CT were similar to what has been reported in the human literature during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [31].",

Image acquisition was conducted with a Siemens Inveon Trimodal Scanner (Siemens Preclinical, Knoxville, TN), which is a small animal imaging platform that combines microPET, microCT, and microSPECT modalities within one unit. This combination facilitated co-registration of PET and CT images as the study subject was kept in a uniform position on the scanner bed, minimizing potentially large motion artifacts as a result of repositioning the animal between each scan. The Inveon microCT scanner features a variable-focus tungsten X-ray source with an achievable resolution of 20 \u00b5m and a detector with a maximum field of view (FOV) of 8.4 cm\u00d75.5 cm. The source-to-object distance was 263.24 mm and the source-to-detector distance was 335.67 mm. The Inveon PET detector provided an axial field of view (FOV) of 12.7 cm with a spatial resolution of 1.44 mm. PET images were reconstructed using a 2D-filtered backprojection algorithm with attenuation correction provided by microCT imaging.

After each ferret underwent microCT imaging, the bed position was reset and microPET imaging with 18F-FDG (PETNET, Louisville, KY) began immediately. For each ferret, 2 mCi of 18F-FDG was administered (i.p.) with a 60\u201390 min uptake period. Radioactive dose was confirmed with an Atomlab 500 Dose Calibrator (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., NY).",
