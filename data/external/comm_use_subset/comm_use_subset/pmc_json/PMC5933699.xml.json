            "text": "Ebolaviruses are negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses capable of causing acute haemorrhagic fever. The prototypical Ebola virus (EBOV; Zaire ebolavirus) was responsible for the recent West Africa outbreak that resulted in 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths between 2014 and 2016 [1]. The reservoir of this lethal pathogen has not been conclusively proven, though there is good evidence suggesting fruit bats as a primary source of exposure [2]. Furthermore, survivors of ebolavirus disease (EVD) can carry the virus in immunologically privileged sites for over one year, post-recovery from the acute infection [3,4]. Resultantly, there is an increased awareness of the risk of alternate forms of transmission in EVD as survivors may carry EBOV in semen for over 12 months, causing sexual transmission, or in breast milk, which can lead to infection of newborns [4,5]. In 2004, funding from Project BioShield (United States Department of Health and Human Services) spurred research that has led to the development of novel therapeutics to prevent and treat EVD, resulting in a very promising vaccine that was evaluated during the 2014 outbreak and showed 100% efficacy in disease prevention [6,7]. Following Project BioShield and the 2014 West Africa outbreak, there has been extensive research into the ebolaviruses that has greatly expanded our understanding of viral replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Ebolavirus is a genus within the family Filoviridae, which also includes the genus Marburgvirus (e.g., Marburg virus: MARV) and Cuevavirus (e.g., Lloviu virus) [8]. The Ebolavirus genus contains five species: Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, and lastly, Reston ebolavirus, the only member that is nonpathogenic in humans for reasons that are still unclear [9]. The majority of research has focused on Zaire ebolavirus, as this species has been associated with the greatest number of outbreaks and has the highest case\u2013fatality rates of all the ebolaviruses (30%\u201390%, depending on the specific outbreak), though as a consequence, many novel or species-specific functions of ebolavirus proteins may be undiscovered. The 19 kb viral genome encodes for seven main proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP), L-polymerase (L) protein, viral protein (VP) 24, VP30, VP35, and VP40 (Fig 1) [10]. L is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and forms the RdRp complex with VP30 that is responsible for viral genome transcription and replication. VP24 and VP35 inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and facilitate evasion of the host immune response. NP encapsidates the viral genome into the nucleocapsid, whilst VP40 drives viral assembly and budding. GP is the only protein on the surface of the virion and is essential for binding to target cells and subsequently mediating membrane fusion and the release of the viral genome. However, recent research has uncovered a multitude of new, often overlapping roles for ebolavirus proteins, and it is not possible to view viral replication as a one-protein\u2013one-function process (Table 1). In this review, we examine the collection of recently identified secondary functions of ebolavirus proteins in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of roles of each protein in viral replication and pathogenicity.",

            "text": "VP24 is one of the most studied filovirus proteins, with the majority of studies focusing on its primary role in inhibiting the host IFN response. VP24 is known to inhibit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 activation by binding to key host proteins from the karyopherin \u03b1 family (karyopherin \u03b11, \u03b15, and \u03b16) preventing their binding to and the subsequent nuclear import of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) [11]. In addition, VP24 blocks IFN signalling by directly binding to STAT1, preventing its phosphorylation, nuclear import, and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) [11\u201313]. Recent data suggest VP24 is also able to block IFN induction by supressing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation following tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) stimulation [14] and by supressing retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)\u2013dependent activation of IFN-\u03b31 gene expression [15]. Furthermore, the innate response antagonist domains (IRAD) in EBOV VP24 and VP35 have been implicated in preventing the maturation of EBOV-infected dendritic cells by modulating global gene expression [16,17]. This effect required both VP24 and VP35 IRAD domains, though the VP24 IRAD domain alone was sufficient to down-regulate cytokine signalling pathways [17]. These results highlight the importance of cooperative action of multiple viral proteins for evasion of the host immune response.",

            "text": "VP24 has also recently been seen to function in capsid assembly [18]. NP and VP35 are known to be the major components of the viral nucleocapsid, though VP24 is weakly associated and may act as a catalyst for particle formation [18]. Further evidence for a structural role of VP24 comes from the observation that N- or C-terminal deletions in VP24 inhibited the formation of nucleocapsid-like structures mediated by VP24, VP35, and NP coexpression [19]. It was suggested that the N-terminal domain of VP24 facilitates capsid formation by mediating protein\u2013protein interactions. This is supported by the observation that mutation of the VP24 N-terminal domain results in protein aggregation [19]. A recent study confirmed the interaction between VP24 and NP, showing that VP24 residues V170 and N171 are located on a highly conserved exposed loop that interacts with NP during nucleocapsid assembly [20]. Coexpression of VP24 and VP40 results in a greater production of virus-like particles (VLPs) than when VP40 is expressed alone [21]. Similarly, in live EBOV infection, VP24 small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown decreases viral budding and increases the retention of viral proteins within the cell [22]. Further evidence suggests that VP24 binds to VP35 on the outer surface of the nucleocapsid where it organises the adjacent NP layer, promoting nucleocapsid stability and explaining the observed interactions between NP, VP24, and VP35 during nucleocapsid formation [23].",

            "text": "In addition to its role in nucleocapsid stability, VP24 may be necessary for incorporation of the viral RNA (vRNA) genome into the nucleocapsid. Several studies have shown that VP24, together with VP35, induce conformational changes in NP that are necessary for RNA encapsidation [18,24,25]. It was shown that VP24 may be directly involved in length-dependent vRNA interactions and packaging [26]. In the study, transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) were analysed for RNA content, and a significant reduction of packaged RNA was observed when VP24 was knocked down with an interfering micro-RNA (miRNA). The trVLPs that were produced showed a 2-fold reduction in RNA content and a 10-fold reduction of infectivity, suggesting that VP24 may play an essential role in RNA packaging. Furthermore, disruption of the VP24\u2013NP interaction reduced RNA packaging and resulted in a significant reduction in reporter activity, highlighting the importance of VP24 in RNA packaging [20]. In addition, trVLP reporter gene activity was significantly affected by the presence of VP24 in a genome-length-dependent manner. Using the trVLP tetracistronic genome system, the presence of VP24 during VLP production resulted in a 25-fold increase in reporter gene activity upon subsequent infection, whereas the presence of VP24 had no effect when monocistronic minigenome systems were used in the trVLP, suggesting a genome-length-dependent role for VP24 in RNA packaging and VLP infectivity. Surprisingly, VP24 may also have a length-dependent role in transcriptional regulation. It was observed that VP24 moderately inhibited the expression of reported genes from monocistronic minigenome plasmids [27]. However, VP24 expression had no effect on protein expression from the trVLP tetracistronic genomes [26]. Whilst the impact of VP24 on protein expression is not clear, VP24 itself may be subject to length-dependent transcriptional regulation. Recent work has implicated the length of the intergenic region (IR) between VP30 and VP24 as having a significant impact on VP24 expression by regulating transcription initiation frequency (Fig 1) [28,29]. The importance of the broad range of VP24 functions during virus replication is highlighted by the fact that it has not been possible to create a VP24-deficient recombinant EBOV, even when VP24 is supplied in trans [22].",

VP35 is a type-I IFN antagonist, inhibiting the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 via double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding and reducing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by inhibiting RIG-I signalling [30\u201332]. VP35 also blocks IFN production by increasing protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1)-mediated SUMOylation of IRF-7, thus inhibiting IFN production following toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I activation [33]. Lastly, VP35 is a suppressor of RNA silencing, functionally equivalent to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein and important for viral evasion of the innate immune response [34]. Together, there is significant evidence demonstrating VP35\u2019s intricate ability to inhibit innate immune signalling and the host antiviral response (Fig 2).",

            "text": "Recent work suggests that VP35 may have more diverse functions during virus replication, as VP35 was shown to interact with L and facilitate genome transcription through the formation of the RdRp complex and genome packaging through association with NP [35\u201337]. The first 450 residues of VP35 appear to be essential for binding to L and thus RdRp function, whereas the C-terminus associates with NP, thus linking NP and L during nucleocapsid assembly [36,38]. N-terminal deletions in VP35 block these interactions and were sufficient to inhibit the replication and transcription of an EBOV minigenome system [38]. The role of the VP35 C-terminus in capsid assembly is perhaps surprising, as this region contains the IFN inhibitory domain responsible for its main role in immune evasion. However, this domain contains several conserved stretches of basic residues involved in dsRNA binding and IFN inhibition, whereas a preceding stretch mediates interaction with NP [36]. Further research found the VP35\u2013NP interaction controls the switch between RNA-bound NP and free NP, thus switching between genome replication and genome packaging in the nucleocapsid [39]. An N-terminal peptide derived from the VP35 NP-binding protein region (NPBP) binds NP with high affinity, causing the release of RNA from NP and resulting in the activation of genome transcription and the inhibition of NP oligomerisation (Fig 2) [39]. Additional investigation of VP35\u2013NP binding showed two further interaction sites. Hydrophobic VP35\u2013NP binding at these sites inhibited NP oligomerisation and prevented NP\u2013RNA binding by blocking access to the RNA binding domain [40]. Work by Leung and colleagues suggests that during nucleocapsid formation, the NPBP peptide first disassociates from NP, then RNA binds to NP, followed by NP oligomerisation. In contrast, Kirchdoerfer and colleagues show that monomeric NP has no significant affinity for RNA, suggesting that the NPBP peptide would be displaced by an additional NP molecule, causing NP oligomerisation that would then allow for RNA binding. However, in either process, VP35\u2013NP interactions are crucial for virus replication and are being explored as targets for future therapeutics [41,42].",

LC8 was seen to stabilise VP35 N-terminal oligomerisation in a dose-dependent manner and enhance viral genome synthesis [46]. It was noted that LC8 functions mostly in the early stages of infection, enhancing early viral gene expression before the host cells are able to establish the antiviral state.

However, Pleet and colleagues noted that the presence of VP40 in the exosomes caused a down-regulation of miRNA machinery in both the donor and recipient cells, including a reduction in the expression of Dicer, argonaute-1, and Drosha (Fig 3). It was previously noted that VP35, VP30, and VP40 are capable of interacting with the miRNA/RNAi pathway [54]; however, this was the first demonstration that the suppression of RNA silencing can be transferred to na\u00efve cells in the absence of virus. Currently, the precise mechanism in which VP40 interacts with miRNA machinery has yet to be characterised, and it is not yet known if the action of VP40 on the miRNA machinery directly causes apoptosis or if the exosomes contain other proteins or RNAs that may be responsible for causing the induction of apoptosis. However, the repression of key proteins in the miRNA pathway has been previously linked to the induction of apoptosis; thus, the suppression of RNA silencing may serve both to directly counteract the innate cellular immune response and to induce apoptosis of bystander immune cells, blocking the activation of adaptive immunity [57,61,66].",

As VP40 also plays a role in immune evasion (via RNAi suppression and exosome-bystander cell death), there is increased motivation for developing therapeutics that target one or multiple functions of VP40. It is known that viral replication requires VP40 phosphorylation at tyrosine 13 by the cellular tyrosine kinase Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 1 (c-Abl1) [69]. In addition, recent results showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in complex with Cyclin A or Cyclin E phosphorylated exosomal VP40 at serine-233 [61]. Thus, the inhibition or modulation of VP40 phosphorylation may be a target for new therapeutics. Lastly, Pleet and colleagues showed that treatment with the FDA-approved drug Oxytetracycline reduced VP40 exosome release and significantly increased donor cell viability upon treatment with VP40 exosomes, further suggesting that targeting the secondary functions of VP40 may be a new approach for developing antivirals for EVD.",

            "text": "The GP gene has been shown to encode for three different products due to transcriptional editing by L: full length GP, which consist of GP1 (receptor binding) and GP2 (viral fusion) subunits; soluble GP (sGP), which lacks the transmembrane domain; and small soluble GP (ssGP) [70,71]. Due to furin cleavage of sGP, a smaller cleaved fragment is also produced, called \u0394-peptide [72]. GP is the only viral protein located on the surface of the virion and has a critical role in attachment and fusion [73\u201375]. Ebolaviruses are thought to predominantly enter cells via GP-dependent macropinocytosis, though other mechanisms have been reported, depending on factors such as host cell type [76,77]. After entry, GP directs fusion between the viral membrane and endolysosomes that contain the viral receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2), enabling release of the viral genome [78,79]. During the 2014\u20132016 outbreak, a mutation in GP at A82V was detected with high frequency [80\u201382]. This mutation increased GP membrane fusion activity and increased infectivity in a variety of cell types, including chimpanzee fibroblasts (S008842), rhesus epithelial (FRhK4), African green monkey epithelial (Vero), and human dendritic cells. The authors propose that this mutation is likely a result of EBOV adaptation to the human host, as several viral variants have been seen to increase human cell infectivity while decreasing virus entry in nonhuman primates [83\u201385]. Thus, the specific nature of protein function needs to be considered in the context of the given host.",

Several studies have shown that GP contributes to EBOV virulence; however, it is not sufficient on its own to be defined as a virulence marker, despite having marked effects beyond entry and fusion [86]. EBOV GP expression has been well established as having a cytotoxic effect on host cells [87\u201389]. GP cytotoxicity is mediated through the mucin-like domain and its effect on the extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [90]. EBOV GP reduces the phosphorylation and catalytic activity of ERK2, resulting in the loss of cell adherence, cell rounding, and the induction of non-apoptotic cell death. The decrease in ERK2 activity was also necessary for GP-induced down-regulation of \u03b1V integrin expression, further impairing cell adherence and tight junction formation. In addition, the sGP cleavage product, \u0394-peptide, may play a role in EBOV pathogenicity by acting as a viroporin [91]. \u0394-peptide is able to form pores in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, increasing ion permeability and causing cytotoxicity [92]. However, it is not known if the \u0394-peptide can be released from cells or if its induction of cytotoxicity is limited to within the infected cell. In order to regulate the toxicity caused by GP and its cleavage products at early stages of infection, GP expression is dynamically regulated [93]. The balance and timing of EBOV GP/sGP/ssGP/shed-GP/\u0394-peptide expression has been found to be pivotal in virus replication, affecting not only cell death but viral assembly and budding [94].",

Recent work suggests that GP does not directly affect viral assembly or budding, but rather counteracts the cellular budding restriction factor tetherin [95]. In the absence of GP, VLPs assemble and bud but are retained on the cell surface through the antiviral tethering actions of the tetherin protein. GP expression enabled VLP release but did not affect tetherin cell-surface localisation, nor was a specific GP\u2013tetherin interaction found [96]. It was shown that the GP glycosylation and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were critical for anti-tetherin activity, though mutation of the RBD did not affect interactions with tetherin, and inhibition of GP\u2013NPC1 binding did not affect the anti-tetherin activity [97]. Instead, it is thought that GP is specifically able to block the association between VP40 and tetherin, though the nature of tetherin\u2013VP40 interaction and the mechanism of GP inhibition is not known [98].",

GP repression of ERK2 activity reduces integrin expression and cell adherence; however, GP also induces endothelial cell activation, further decreasing endothelial barrier functions [99]. During EBOV infection of endothelial cells, cell adhesion molecules (CAM) ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were found to be transcriptionally upregulated, with increased cell surface expression of CAMs. The activity occurs with cellular GP expression as well as following the transfer of GP-containing VLPs; viral replication does not appear to be required. Endothelial activation was not observed in the absence of GP, nor with the GP transcriptional variant sGP or the GP cleavage product \u0394-peptide [99]. GP-induced endothelial cell activation may facilitate decreased barrier function, whilst the up-regulation of CAMs may facilitate adhesion and subsequent infection of immune cells, such as macrophages. A model was proposed whereby activated endothelial cells result in increased leukocyte recruitment, resulting in thrombomodulin release, resulting in an activated, leukocyte-rich endothelium in a procoagulant state [100]. Whether this is an unintended consequence of GP or has a role in increased viral spread and infectivity is yet to be investigated.",

GP on the cell plasma membrane has been shown to be cleaved by TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE), resulting in the release of a soluble cleaved product called shed GP that is missing the transmembrane domain [101]. Shed GP was seen to activate uninfected macrophages and dendritic cells, resulting in the production of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, with subsequent effects on vascular permeability [102]. It is thought that shed GP activates macrophages by binding to and activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in a manner requiring GP glycosylation. Recently it was also shown that full-length GP on VLPs can also trigger the activation of TLR4 in macrophages, resulting in a similar activation phenotype [103]. In contrast, GP binding to TLR4 on T lymphocytes directly triggers cell death through an up-regulation of caspase 9, even in the absence of infection [104]. In dendritic cells, GP was found to interact with the liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin), a C-type lectin that contains two amino acids, residues N256 and N274, that bind GP in a Ca2+-dependant manner, triggering the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signalling and the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [105]. As shed GP retains most of the structure of full-length GP, this soluble molecule is capable of binding to and neutralising circulating anti-GP antibodies, facilitating viral immune evasion [101].",

The structure of sGP in complex with antibodies was recently solved and highlights differences in antibody reactivity between GP and sGP [107]. Whilst GP is trimeric, sGP oligomerises into a parallel homodimer. Cross-reactive c13C6 antibody epitopes are presented similarly on GP and sGP, though the authors report that one c13C6 antibody binds to one GP trimer, whereas multiple different immune-complexes were formed with sGP, ranging from rectangular complexes with a 2:2 ratio of c13C6 antibody to sGP dimer up to pentagonal 5:5 antibody:sGP complexes [107]. This further supports the hypothesis that sGP enhances viral immune evasion by biasing the antibody response towards sGP binding.",

At present, all research has focused on these primary activities of NP, and any secondary roles remain to be determined [18,25,40]. Similarly, the RNA-dependent L-polymerase is an essential component of the RdRp complex and required for viral genome transcription and replication [10]. It has been observed that L can also edit mRNA, as seen with the GP gene, where L-editing results in the production of the GP transcript instead of sGP [108]. L-editing may also regulate the different expression levels of GP, sGP and ssGP. During serial passage in tissue culture cells, L was found to add a single uridine (U) residue to a site consisting of 7 Us in the GP gene, changing the expression ratio of GP:sGP to 80:20. A single passage in guinea pigs caused reversion of the genome back to 7 Us and changed the GP:sGP expression ratio back to 20:80, which may facilitate immune evasion during in vivo replication [109]. In contrast, during viral replication in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line (Huh7), a 9U variant was seen that retained the high level expression of sGP but had enhanced expression of ssGP [71]. It is speculated that these rapid alterations in the GP gene may act as a regulatory mechanism, enabling efficient virus replication in different host environments.

In addition, VP35 blockade of IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation inhibits the production of IFN-\u03b2. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of VP35 in regulating NP\u2013RNA association. During viral genome replication, the VP35 N-terminal peptide binds to NP, enabling the vRNA to associate with the RdRp complex for replication. During virus assembly, VP35 disassociates, enabling NP to oligomerise, bind RNA, and form the nucleocapsid. 5\u2019PPP, 5\u2019 triphosphate; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; IFN, interferon; IKK, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; NP, nucleoprotein; PACT, protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; TANK, tumour necrosis factor\u2013receptor-associated factor family member\u2013associated nuclear factor kappa B activator; TBK1, tumour necrosis factor\u2013receptor-associated factor family member\u2013associated nuclear factor kappa B activator binding kinase 1; TRAF3, tumour necrosis factor\u2013receptor-associated factor 3; VP, viral protein; vRNA, viral RNA.",
