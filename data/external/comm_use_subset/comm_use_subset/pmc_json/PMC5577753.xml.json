The causative agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was identified as a member of the alphacoronavirus from the family Coronaviridae [1]. The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length, comprising 7 open reading frames (ORF): ORF 1a/1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), in that order [4]. In the process of cell culture and clinical spread of PEDV, several genomic sites show variation and recombination, which are closely related with PEDV cell adaptation, pathogenicity, and evolution [5, 6].",

The propagation of PEDV isolates requires supplementation with trypsin in the cell culture supernatant in vitro [1]. Trypsin cleaves the S protein, allowing a conformational change and then mediating fusion activity [8, 9]. The S1/S2 junction and S2\u2032 location have been identified as the important protease cleavage sites [10]. The S2\u2032 cleavage site, FP position, and HR1 domain have been predicted as the determinants for trypsin-dependent entry, and the trypsin-induced cell\u2013cell fusion is weakened by mutation of the S2\u2032 site [8].",

Subsequently, the unfolded protein response (UPR) would be triggered to restore the ER homeostasis via three ER-resident transmembrane proteins, otherwise cell apoptosis might be induced [12]. In fact, PEDV has been reported to induce ER stress, UPR, and caspase-independent apoptosis [12, 13].",

The E protein, especially the transmembrane domain, is involved in ion-conduction properties, and is highly associated with virus maturation, production, efficient release, and virus-host interactions, which are reflected in the cellular stress, UPR, apoptosis, inflammatory response and pathogenicity [11, 15\u201317]. Different coronaviruses have varied requirements for the E protein in morphogenesis and virus release. The E protein is absolutely essential for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), but not for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) [14, 18, 19]. In PEDV, the E protein is located in the ER or nucleus, and has been reported to induce ER stress alone in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) expressing the PEDV E protein [20]. It remains poorly understood whether or how the E protein participates in PEDV production and infection, and what the critical region is.",

The results show that strain 85-7 proliferated effectively, and reached the peak viral titer (about 105.5 pfu/mL) at 48 hpi (Figure 2A). The essential first step of virus infection is binding to the host cell receptor, and for PEDV, this is related closely to the release of the fusion peptide of the spike protein into target cellular membranes [7]. A large number of host proteases have been identified to activate the CoV-spike protein proteolytically, including the cell surface transmembrane type II serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, and trypsin [10, 29]. Supplementation with trypsin could assist the virion entry effectively and enhanced their release [8]. By contrast, some PEDV mutants infected Vero cells using a trypsin-independent process [8]. Therefore, the trypsin-dependency of strain 85-7 was further tested, indeed, the virus could infect Vero cells with or without the trypsin in the entry stage (Figure 2B). It should be noted that our results showed a gradual attenuation in the infection of strain 85-7 with increasing trypsin concentration (Figure 2B), as the highest virus titer was reached about 106 pfu/mL in the absence of trypsin at 48 hpi (Figure 2B). These observations indicated that the release of infectious PEDV particles was more efficient without the assistance of trypsin activity, suggesting that strain 85-7 might employ a specific protease cleavage mechanism of the S protein for its infection process.\n",

Herein, five repeats of strain 85-7 (purified from different virus plaques from the same generation and genetic background) were propagated serially for over 40 passages successfully in Vero cells. For subsequent research, the corresponding strains were designated as A40, B40, C40, D40, and E40 (Figure 3A). Growth kinetic analysis was performed on Vero cells at an MOI of 0.1 under the trypsin-free conditions. Strains A40, B40, and D40 showed a similar growth pattern to the parent virus, while C40 and E40 strains yielded significantly higher titers than other strains during the whole infection process (Figure 3B). The C40 and E40 strains induced CPE morphology of cell pycnosis and non-syncytium formation, which was completely different to that of the other strains (Figure 3C), being consistent with the above observations. Furthermore, the C40 and E40 viruses yielded smaller plaques, even at 5 days post-infection (Figure 3D). All of these observations suggest that C40 and E40 strains might contain some important mutations that contributed to the difference of infection characteristics.\n",

The analysis of the variable regions of the five mutant strains show that the nucleotide sequences of the non-structural protein Nsp8, Nsp9, and Nsp15 were not subject to any variations during the Vero cell adaptation process of PEDV strain 85-7. Overall, we identified four major variable regions (V1\u2013V4) that contained the most mutation sites (Figure 3E). V1 was located in Nsp2 and comprised a 330 nt deletion (at position 2080\u20132409) in the C-terminal coding region that led to 110 aa deletion. V2 was located in the S gene and comprised numerous point mutations that were dispersed in the S1 and S2 domains, but with no insertions or deletions. Compared with the parental S gene, there were 7 nt and 27 nt variation points in S1 and S2 regions that induced 6 and 24 aa mutations among the five stable passage strains, respectively. V3 was located in the ORF3 gene with a 3 nt (at position 25 148\u201325 150) and a 134 nt (at position 25 240\u201325 373) deletion, causing a 1 aa deletion and the early-termination of encoding mRNA, respectively. V4 was located in the E gene and comprised a 15 nt deletion (at position 25 432\u201325 446) and 1 nt mutation (T25460C), which caused a 5 aa deletion (16\u201320 aa) and 1 aa (L25P) mutation in the E protein, respectively (Additional files 2 and 3). The mutation regions of PEDV strain 85-7 varied with unfixed patterns: only two mutation sites were shared among the five variant strains, namely T24530C and G24572C in the S2 region.",

Given that the S protein plays a key role in the coronavirus infection process [26], we identified important sites in the S protein of the five variant strains. The fusion peptide (FP) residues located immediately on the C-terminus of the S2\u2032 cleavage site are very highly conserved across all CoV [30]; however, strains B40 and D40 showed the mutations from 898IEDLLF903 to 898IEALVV903 in the FP domain (Additional file 4), which had no significant difference in infection characteristics between them and the parent strain (Figures 3, 5I and J). The only mutational position shared by strains C40 and E40 strains in S protein was the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) in the S2\u2032 cleavage site (R895G) (Figures 3E and 4B; Additional files 2 and 3). Notably, this site has been reported to be associated with trypsin-induced cell\u2013cell fusion in the PEDV infection process [8], and also serves as the location of the putative cleavage site within the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S protein [10, 31]. In addition, the C40 and E40 strains also shared a novel variation region in the E gene, namely V4 region with a 15 nt deletion and a 1 nt mutation (Figure 3E; Additional file 2).\n",

Although C40 showed higher virus production and dissimilar infection characteristics in cell culture, it remains unknown whether these differences could improve viral fitness. Thus, we performed a competition assay between the C30 and C40 strains at ratios of 1:1 or 4:1. Through serial subculture three times, the abundance of the C30 strain decreased significantly and was always outcompeted by the C40 strain (Figure 4G), which showed a distinct growth advantage, indicating that strain C40 had evolved for better adaptation to cell culture.

Our results show that C30 and C40 strains significantly activated HSPA5 (the gene encoding GRP78) transcription and GRP78 production during the virus replication process compared with those of the parent strain (Figure 5C). Meanwhile, the transcriptions of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were also significantly up-regulated in C30 and C40 infected cells than parent virus infected cells (Figures 5D and E). Further study showed that overexpression of mutant E protein could induce significantly higher mRNA level of IL-6, IL-8, and GRP78 than parent E protein (Figures 5F\u2013H; Additional file 6). These results indicate that the variation in the TM domain of the E protein caused a notable effect on its interaction with the host cells.",

Furthermore, PEDV undergoes frequent variation in the process of clinical evolution and cell culture, which contributes to its fast adaptation to the host microenvironment [5, 21, 37, 38]. Indeed, genomic stability analysis of PEDV strain 85-7 identified four major variable regions, located in the Nsp2, S, ORF3, and E genes, respectively.

Similarly, mutations in Nsp2 did not affect viral replication but caused a modest reduction in titers and viral RNA synthesis in MHV and SARS-CoV [39]. The protein domains of Nsp1 to Nsp3 homologs showed minimal sequence identity among different coronavirus groups [39]. In fact, Nsp2 is one of the most variable regions, with diverse recombination events being identified in field strains of PEDV [4], but is not involved in the PEDV-induced IFN antagonistic effect [37], all of which suggest that Nsp2 might mediate virus evolution, rather than playing a role in viral replication. Similarly, the early termination of ORF3 gene studied here had no significant effects on PEDV replication, while the function of ORF3 in PEDV replication is controversial and requires further exploration [5, 37, 40\u201342].",

The R895 site of PEDV S protein forms the novel XXXR/S motif, and has been identified as a putative S2\u2032 cleavage site, which was predicted as the determinant in trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV [8]. However, PEDV 85-7 parent and all the mutant strains (including the C30 and C40 strains differing single mutation R895G) could effectively proliferate in Vero cells in a trypsin-independent manner, and the entry or release of infectious PEDV particles was more efficiently without trypsin supplementation, indicating that the S2\u2032 site was not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. Coupled with the reports that R895G mutation in S protein could inhibit cell\u2013cell fusion specifically in both PEDV and SARS-CoV [8, 10], suggesting that the PEDV induced cell\u2013cell fusion capacity might be more closely related with the S2\u2032 cleavage site than with trypsin supplementation.

Notably, the residues 901LLF903, but not the D900, have been shown to have a crucial role in membrane fusion in SARS-CoV [30]. However, the B40 and D40 strains with point mutations comprising D900A (Alanine), L902 V (Valine), and F903 V showed similar infection characteristics to the parent strain (Figure 3; Additional file 4).

The SARS-CoV E protein alone was sufficient to reduce the expression of GRP78 and GRP94 (two ER stress inducible proteins) [11], whereas the PEDV E protein could be located in the ER, and then induced ER stress and up-regulated GRP78 alone [20], suggesting that the E proteins from diverse Coronavirus viruses might employ different mechanisms to mediate the stress response. Furthermore, SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E) has been demonstrated to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [11]. In PEDV, the E protein also increased IL-8 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) [33] and Vero cells (Figures 5E and H), suggesting that the E protein is closely related to inflammation. These studies, coupled with the reports that TM domain alterations of CoV E protein are involved in virus assembly, replication and release [15, 32], supported our speculation that the TM domain of PEDV E protein plays a potential role in interaction with host cells, including ER stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and apoptosis. Especially, it is the variation of the E protein, not the amount of virus production, that is responsible for the increase of the cell stress response. Some recent studies have reported that the ion channel (IC) activity of CoV E protein has important functions in immune response modulation via NLRP3 inflammasome, and the IC activity relies on its TM domain [17, 44]. However, it needs further study whether the variation of the TM domain in this study has an impact on the ion channel activity of PEDV E protein and the following immune response modulation.",

Furthermore, the E protein, especially the V4 region in the TM domain, is crucial for modulating the PEDV cell stress response and immune response. In short, continuous passage of PEDV strain 85-7 induces the above two variations to adapt the virus to the host microenvironment for better proliferation.",
