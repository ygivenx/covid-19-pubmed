Approximately 55% of cattle within the United Kingdom are seropositive for bovine torovirus, and this pathogen represents a significant burden to the industry (2, 3). Similarly, porcine torovirus is endemic to Europe and causes disease in production herds (4\u20136). Despite this, limited research has been conducted on these pathogens, and neither specific antiviral treatments nor vaccines are available. The prevalence of toroviruses in nondomestic reservoirs and potential for cross-species transmission have not been assessed, although they are known to undergo recombination events (7). The extensive research conducted upon the related coronaviruses would not necessarily be relevant in the event of an emerging torovirus infection due to the divergent nature of these viruses.",

One of the hallmarks of this virus order is the utilization of an unusual transcription mechanism to express the genes encoding structural and accessory proteins, which reside downstream of the large replicase open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b (Fig. 1). These proteins are typically translated from a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sg mRNAs). Although, with the exception of the smallest species, these sgRNAs are structurally polycistronic, translation is normally limited to the 5\u2032 ORF of each mRNA. Studies of coronaviruses and arteriviruses have revealed that they produce negative-sense subgenome-sized RNAs via a mechanism of discontinuous extension (8) (recently reviewed by Sola et al. [9]). This process may resemble homology-assisted copy-choice recombination (10) and requires the presence of multiple copies of a species-specific short motif, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). TRS motifs are located immediately upstream of the structural protein-coding ORFs (body TRSs) and within the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR; leader TRS).",

When the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has copied a TRS sequence, a template-switching event may occur during which the anti-TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the nascent strand base pairs with the leader TRS within the 5\u2032 UTR. Transcription reinitiates and continues to the 5\u2032 end of the genomic template. The resulting \u201canti-leader\u201d sequence that is added ranges from 55 to 92 nucleotides (nt) in coronaviruses to \u223c200 nt in arteriviruses. These negative-sense transcripts are therefore 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-coterminal with the full-length negative RNA strand and are identifiable as chimeras with distinct flanking sequences adjacent to the core TRS. The anti-leader sequence in each of the negative-sense templates then functions as a promoter to drive synthesis of a mirror set of positive-sense sgRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins.",

Specifically, the two sg mRNAs of roniviruses (pathogens of shrimp) do not possess conserved 5\u2032 leader sequences, indicative of the lack of a discontinuous step during their production (12). Despite the presence of a conserved body TRS in each subgenomic mRNA, an equivalent leader TRS is not readily identifiable in the 5\u2032 UTR. It may therefore be reasoned that the ronivirus body TRSs stimulate termination of negative-strand RNA synthesis without a subsequent RdRp template switch and reinitiation. Mesoniviruses (a branch of Nidovirales recently identified in insects) are thought to produce two major sgRNAs possessing leader sequences of different lengths, indicating that the nidoviral mechanism for discontinuous RNA synthesis can allow two very different leader/body TRS pairs to be utilized in a single viral species (13).",

Despite similarities to the corona- and arteriviral mechanism, the preceding leader sequence incorporated into this mRNA is merely 6 nt in length (ACGUAU). Additionally, this case is unusual in that the template switch event is thought to be prompted by an RNA structure, a predicted RNA hairpin upstream of the S protein gene, rather than a body TRS (14). Conventional body TRSs are located upstream of the three remaining structural protein genes, yet a nondiscontinuous mechanism is utilized for the production of the corresponding sgRNAs, as is the case for roniviruses. As a result, the sg mRNAs for membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) do not normally possess a common 5\u2032 leader sequence; they each possess a variable and unique extended version of the TRS at their 5\u2032 end.

Strikingly, we also identified a small proportion of chimeric transcripts spanning from the leader to the body TRS of the N protein gene, indicating that discontinuous and nondiscontinuous mechanisms compete in this location. We also identified numerous locations across the genome where noncanonical RdRp template-switching occurs, leading to a vast array of (presumably mostly defective or nonfunctional) chimeric transcripts.",

The Ribo-seq/RNA-seq ratio along the genome was calculated (Fig. 2C) to estimate translation efficiency (note that this simple estimate is na\u00efve, since it does not account for the fact that the genomic RNA and different sgRNA species overlap one another). Ribo-seq density, RNA-seq density, and translational efficiency were also calculated separately for each ORF (Fig. 3), based on the density of Ribo-seq reads in each ORF divided by the density of the RNA-seq reads for either the same region (for sgRNAs) or the region of the genome which does not overlap the sgRNAs (for genomic RNA [gRNA]). RNA-seq density was adjusted based on the \u201cdecumulation\u201d methodology described previously (17) (see Materials and Methods) to account for the fact that not all of the RNA-seq density in the 3\u2032 ORFs derives from transcripts from which the ORFs can be expressed. Ribo-seq coverage is much higher toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome, particularly across the M and N genes, reflecting the translation of abundant sgRNAs in this region (Fig. 2 and 3). ORFs 1a and 1b contain a considerably lower density of Ribo-seq reads. The relatively low translation efficiencies calculated for ORFs 1a and 1b may be partly due to some gRNA being packaged (or destined for packaging) and unavailable for translation but still contributing to the estimate of gRNA RNA-seq density. They may also represent regulation of expression to control the amount of the replicase proteins, which are generally required at a lower level than structural proteins. ORF1a has a higher Ribo-seq density and a higher translational efficiency than ORF1b, reflecting the proportion of ribosomes terminating at the ORF1a stop codon and not undergoing the \u22121 frameshift into ORF1b (Fig. 2 and 3). As expected, RNA-seq density is similar across ORF1a and ORF1b, as both are present only on the full-length genomic RNA (Fig. 2). The region covering the HE ORF also has low ribosomal coverage (Fig. 2), which may be due to the fact that, in contrast to other toroviruses, the EToV HE gene is nonfunctional due to a large deletion, including the canonical AUG (18). HE is not shown in Fig. 3, as the HE transcript is much less abundant than the upstream M transcript, which makes the decumulation procedure susceptible to noise (17). Translational efficiency appears highest for the M and S sgRNAs. The high RNA-seq density in the 5\u2032 UTR may be indicative of one or more defective interfering (DI) RNAs in the sample (see below). Ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) were also identified mapping to the second half of the 5\u2032 UTR, mostly in the +2/\u22121 frame with respect to ORF1a (Fig. 2A).",

After adaptor trimming, the majority (75%) of Ribo-seq reads were 27 to 29 nt in length, which is consistent with the expected size of mammalian ribosome footprints. As expected, the distribution of read lengths for RNA-seq was much broader, peaking between 60 and 70 nt (Fig. 4). For quality control, histograms of the 5\u2032 end positions of host mRNA Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads relative to initiation and termination codons were constructed (Fig. 5 and 6). This confirmed we had high-quality RPFs arising from host transcripts, with strong triplet periodicity (phasing) and very few reads mapping to 3\u2032 UTRs. As in other data sets, a ramp effect of decreased RPF density was seen over a region of \u223c30 codons following initiation sites; however, unusually, in this data set we did not observe a density peak at the initiation site itself (see Irigoyen et al. [17]). This may be due to the flash freezing without cycloheximide pretreatment used for these samples, as for a later cycloheximide-treated sample this peak is present (Fig. 5). Within coding sequences, the 5\u2032 ends of the majority of reads from the host (65 to 81%) and virus (60 to 75%) mapped to the first codon positions (Fig. 7).",

The ORF1a/1b \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting event is stimulated by a pseudoknot structure 3\u2032 adjacent to the U_UUA_AAC slippery heptanucleotide frameshift site. The efficiency of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (measured by dividing the mean RPF density in ORF1b by the mean density in ORF1a) was estimated to be 29.9% for replicate 1 and 27.5% for replicate 2, which is in accordance with the rates measured previously outside the context of virus infection (20 to 30%) (19).",

Of these, one junction was consistent with the previously characterized sgRNA produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis encoding the S gene (280 reads, or 3% of total chimeric reads) (14). These reads spanned the entire leader-body junction of the S gene, possessing 14 to 18 nt of the 5\u2032 UTR (i.e., the actual 5\u2032-derived sequence is at least 14 nt, ACGUAUCUUUAGAA, comprising the so-called 6-nt leader, the leader TRS CUUUAGA, and an additional A), followed by the stretch of ORF1b just upstream of the S gene. A second set of transcripts containing 5\u2032 leader sequence was identified by four unique reads starting with the 5\u2032 leader (ACGUAU) and TRS sequence (CUUUAGA), where the remainder of the read mapped to the start of the N gene. This indicates that, contrary to previous reports, low levels of discontinuous RNA synthesis are used during production of the N gene negative-strand RNA. The final chimaera, which included the 6-nt leader, was represented by three reads. These reads included 44 to 46 nt of the 5\u2032 UTR (i.e., significantly more than the normal leader TRS) followed by a sequence mapping to positions 19,987 to 19,989, which is within ORF1b.",

Additionally, a large number of reads spanning from the 5\u2032 UTR to either within the N protein gene or the 3\u2032 UTR were identified. Indeed, the only junction represented by over 1,000 reads spanned nucleotides 673 to 27649; similarly, the second most commonly identified junction, with 642 reads, spanned 687 to 27550. If chimeric reads were predominantly a sequencing artifact, the abundance of any particular chimaera would be approximately proportional to the product of the abundances of the sequences from which the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the chimera are derived (with some variation due to sequence-specific biases), thus a high density of chimeras would be expected to fall entirely within the N transcript. In contrast, most of the observed chimeric reads were between N and the 5\u2032 UTR. The relative paucity of reads mapping to generic locations in the ORF1ab region also argues against the majority of chimeras being simply artifactual. The 5\u2032 UTR preference may be due to genome circularization during negative-sense synthesis, as has been proposed for coronaviruses (20). Alternatively, these may derive from autonomously replicating defective interfering RNAs rather than multiple independent RNA translocation and reinitiation events. Such defective interfering RNAs have been extensively analyzed previously and are a common complication of EToV studies relying on high-multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) infections in cell culture (21). Consistent with the high level of 5\u2032 UTR:N chimeric sequences, there was high RNA-seq density throughout much of the 5\u2032 UTR, with the 3\u2032 extent of the region of high density coinciding approximately with the region to which a large number of the chimeric 5\u2032 ends mapped (Fig. 2 and 8).",

We also analyzed differential translational efficiency (based on the RPF/mRNA ratio) between mock- and virus-infected cells. We identified 22 genes that were translated more efficiently in infected cells; GO analysis indicated that these genes tend to encode proteins that are involved in RNA binding. Only two genes were found to be translated less efficiently in infected cells than mock-infected cells (Fig. 9 and Table S2).

We have termed these U1 (80 codons) and U2 (258 codons). We predict that translation of both U1 and U2 is initiated from CUG codons, as a close inspection indicated that ribosomes accumulate at these two sites (Fig. 11). It must be noted that pretreatment with CHX or HAR can introduce artifacts into ribosome profiling data: CHX can lead to an excess of RPF density over \u223c30 codons following initiation sites when cells are stressed (17, 22). It has also been suggested that both drugs can promote upstream initiation due to scanning preinitiation complexes stacking behind ribosomes paused at canonical initiation sites (23). However, the distance between the U1 CUG, the U2 CUG, and the ORF1a initiation site, besides observation of efficient translation of U2 downstream of the ORF1a initiation site (Fig. 11A), makes these artifacts unlikely to be significant confounding factors in the case of U1 and U2.",

Six additional torovirus genome sequences have now become available. We therefore extended the bioinformatics analysis using all eight currently available torovirus genome sequences (Fig. 13). Since the U2 ORF overlaps ORF1a, leading to constraint on dS, the dN/dS analysis is not appropriate for U2. MLOGD analysis indicated that the U2 ORF has a higher coding potential than the corresponding part of ORF1a (Fig. 13). Overlapping genes are thought mainly to evolve through \u201coverprinting\u201d of an ancestral gene by the de novo gene (27). The de novo gene product is often an accessory protein and often disordered (28). Interestingly, the fragment of pp1a encoded by the region of ORF1a that is overlapped by U2 has no tblastn (29) nor HHpred (30) homologues outside the Torovirus genus. Thus, it is unclear which of U2 and the N-terminal domain of pp1a is ancestral. To provide further comparative genomic evidence for the functionality of U2, we used synplot2 to assess conservation at synonymous sites in the ORF1a reading frame, since overlapping functional elements are expected to place extra constraints on synonymous site evolution (31). Consistent with the earlier 2-sequence analysis (26), synplot2 revealed greatly enhanced ORF1a-frame synonymous-site conservation in a region coinciding precisely with the conserved absence of stop codons that defines the U2 ORF (Fig. 13), with the mean rate of synonymous substitutions in that region being 0.20 of the genome average. Summed over the 230-codon overlap region, the probability (P value) that the observed level of conservation would occur by chance is 6.5 \u00d7 10\u221240.",

The highly conserved nature of the canonical leader, M, HE, and N TRSs (CUUUAG[A/U]) across all torovirus genomes (Fig. 15) suggests it is not tolerant to mutations; however, this has not been formally confirmed. Lack of conservation of the EToV U1, ORF1a, and ORF1b TRS sequences is consistent with them not being functionally relevant. Our results indicate this essential nature is likely due to a role in termination of RNA synthesis, as we did not identify a significant role of this motif in the generation of chimeric transcripts. Conversely, the upstream region of the extended TRS (cACN3\u20134CUUUAGA) is tolerant to modifications; indeed, even when this spacer is extended to six nucleotides, transcripts are still detectable at 20% of wild-type levels (36). Again, this is consistent with a role in termination rather than a requirement for repairing with upstream sequences. The canonical TRS sequences also presumably contribute to subgenomic promoter recognition, as the initial CAC is essential, although the adenylate is the first nucleotide on all positive-strand subgenomic transcripts (36). Initiation of sgRNA transcription at AC dinucleotides is also found in the roniviruses (12). It may be that in the Torovirinae and the Roniviridae, the conserved TRS is utilized primarily for signaling termination of RNA synthesis followed by promoter recognition, and any involvement in template switching is merely a by-product of RdRp promiscuity that has been coopted for gene expression in other nidovirids.",

Bafinivirus replication produces three sgRNAs which share an identical 42-nt leader also found at the far 5\u2032 terminus of the genome, indicating this species utilizes discontinuous RNA synthesis in a manner similar to that of the corona- and arteriviruses (37). However, there was preliminary evidence that two of the three sgRNAs exhibit diversity in their junction sites, suggesting the anti-TRS binds to alternative sites within the 5\u2032 leader during strand transfer, consistent with suggestions that, while a threshold level of homology is required, this is not limited to particular primary sequences (38, 39).

It has been suggested that convergent evolution has resulted in the mechanism for discontinuous negative-strand synthesis arising multiple times within the Nidovirales (40). Similarly, whether the initial role of the TRS motif was to merely stimulate the attenuation of RNA synthesis or to direct template switching is not known. Our data suggest that transcription mechanisms in the Nidovirales fall into multiple categories, each requiring a distinct role of the TRS: (i) homology-driven reinitiation (canonical discontinuous RNA synthesis, as seen in coronaviruses and arteriviruses and, to a low extent, EToV N protein-coding mRNAs), (ii) structure-driven discontinuous transcription (EToV S gene), and (iii) transcription termination (EToV M, HE, and the majority of N protein-coding transcripts). These mechanisms require an RdRp which is prone to template switching when even relatively short homologous sequences are present, potentially leading to a large number of irrelevant transcripts being produced (as previously observed in an arterivirus [41, 42]) and also facilitating the production of defective interfering RNAs (36) and recombinant strains (7).",

Some of the identified GO categories, including cytokine signaling, innate immune responses, and ribosome biogenesis, have been identified in previous RNA-seq analyses of various coronaviruses (43, 44). Similarly, although differential translational analyses or proteomic studies have not been conducted on toroviruses, some of the identified proteins have been recognized as being incorporated into nidovirid virions (for example, TCP-1 and multiple heat shock proteins within arterivirus particles) (45). Others have been identified as being upregulated upon infection with coronaviruses, such as the solute carrier family 25 members (46). Notably, both poly(C) and poly(A) binding proteins were preferentially translated in infected cells; these have been previously identified as interaction partners of arteriviral nonstructural protein 1\u03b2 and contribute to viral RNA replication (47).

In the case of U1, the coding sequence contains no AUG codons (in any frame), a situation that would facilitate preinitiation ribosomes to continue scanning to the U2 CUG and the ORF1a AUG initiation sites (50). It remains a possibility that U2 translation initiates at a downstream AUG; however, the only in-frame AUG is located 336 nt downstream of our presumed start site and is in a poor initiation context (C at \u22123) and 3\u2032 of the ORF1a AUG.

U1 is not under such limitations, although it is likely that the viral genome must maintain specific 5\u2032 UTR structures to facilitate viral replication. Previous investigations utilizing defective interfering RNAs have confirmed that no more than the first 604 nt of the 5\u2032 UTR and the entirety of the 3\u2032 UTR are sufficient to allow both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis (36); it is notable that this region only includes one-third of the U1 ORF (which starts at nucleotide 524), hence only this subdomain would be constrained by maintaining two distinct functional roles.

Based on structural similarity to known proteins, one potential function is a virally encoded ion channel (viroporin) embedded in either intracellular or plasma membranes.

To normalize for different library sizes, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus RNA reads and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. In order to standardize the regions used to calculate RNA-seq and Ribo-seq density, the following regions were selected: ORF1a, start codon (position 882) to 5\u2032 end of frameshift site (position 14518); ORF1b, 3\u2032 end of frameshift site (position 14525) to 5\u2032 end of the S gene hairpin (position 21118); all other ORFs, initiation codon to termination codon. For U2, a region overlapping ORF1a was used because only 46 bases are unique to U2. For Fig. 12, the ORF1a coordinates were updated to exclude the region which overlaps U2, giving a range from 1552 to 21394. In addition, for all ORFs, only Ribo-seq reads mapping to the predominant phase (i.e., reads mapping to the first positions of codons) were used, as this should greatly diminish misassignment of ORF1a-translating ribosomes to U2 or vice versa. Reads mapping to the first five codons at the 5\u2032 end of each region or the last six codons at the 3\u2032 end of each region were excluded. For sgRNAs, RNA-seq density was calculated for the same regions as those described for Ribo-seq. For the genomic RNA the regions for ORF1a and ORF1b were combined into the interval from the start codon of ORF1a (position 882) to the 5\u2032 end of the S gene hairpin (position 21118). Ribo-seq and RNA-seq densities were calculated as the RPM values for which the 5\u2032 end maps to each region, divided by the length of the region in nucleotides and then multiplied by 1,000 (i.e., RPKM). For RNA-seq, a decumulation strategy was used to subtract the estimated RNA-seq density for longer overlapping genomic and subgenomic transcripts that would contribute to the RNA-seq density measured for each of the 3\u2032 ORFs: the genomic RNA-seq density was subtracted from all subgenomic densities, and then the RNA-seq densities of overlapping upstream subgenomic transcripts were iteratively subtracted from downstream regions (e.g., RNA-seq density in the unique region of M was subtracted from HE, and this was subtracted from N). Translation efficiency for each gene was calculated as Ribo-seq density/decumulated RNA-seq density. Translational efficiencies for HE could not be accurately estimated, as the low expression of the HE transcript made the decumulation procedure for HE susceptible to noise.",

For differential transcription analysis, gene level counts were generated across the Ensembl release 89 EquCab2.0 gtf file, filtered to include only protein-coding genes. For differential translation efficiency analysis, only coding regions (CDS) were considered: both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq counts were generated at the CDS level using intersection-strict mode, based on the same annotation set. Multimapping reads were excluded from both analyses. Differential transcript abundance analysis was performed using the standard DESeq2 (71) pipeline described in the vignette. Genes for which <10 reads were mapped were discarded. All recommended quality control plots were inspected, and no major biases were identified in the data. False discovery rate (FDR) values were calculated using the R fdrtool package (72). Genes with a log2 fold change of >1 and an FDR of less than 0.1 were considered to be differentially expressed. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis (73) was performed against a background of all horse protein-coding genes in the Ensembl gtf using a Fisher exact test and corrected for multiple testing with a Bonferroni correction. GO annotations for horse genes were downloaded from BiomaRt (Ensembl release 90) (74). Differential translational efficiency analysis was carried out using the CDS counts table, normalized using the DESeq2 \u201csizeFactors\u201d technique. Similar to the differential transcription analysis, genes to which <10 reads mapped were discarded. All recommended quality control plots for DESeq2 were inspected again, and no major biases were identified in the data. Differential translation efficiency analysis was performed using Xtail (75) by following the standard pipeline described in the vignette. P values were adjusted automatically within Xtail using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method. Genes with a log2 fold change of >1 and an adjusted P value of less than 0.1 were considered to be differentially translated. GO enrichment analysis was performed as described for the differential transcript abundance analysis.",

PhyML (79) was used to produce a nucleotide phylogenetic tree for the U1 alignment, and using this tree topology, dN/dS was calculated with codeml. The standard deviations for the codeml dN/dS value was estimated via a bootstrapping procedure in which codon columns of the alignment were randomly resampled (with replacement); 100 randomized alignments were generated, and their dN/dS values were calculated with codeml.",

For these analyses we generated a codon-respecting alignment of the eight torovirus full-genome sequences using a procedure described previously (31). In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 (80). Breda virus (GenBank accession number AY427798) was used as a reference, since unlike Berne virus it contains an intact HE gene. Genomes were then mapped to reference sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple-sequence alignment. This was analyzed with MLOGD using a 40-codon sliding window and a 5-codon step size. For each of the three reading frames, within each window the null model is that the sequence is noncoding, whereas the alternative model is that the sequence is coding in the given reading frame. Positive/negative values indicate that the sequences in the alignment are likely/unlikely to be coding in the given reading frame. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the concatenated coding regions were extracted from the alignment and analyzed with synplot2.",

Breda virus (AY427798.1) was used as the reference genome for this analysis, since EToV has a deletion in the HE gene. In Breda virus, U1 is in frame with ORF1a due to a 2-nt insertion relative to EToV in the short noncoding region between U1 and U2. The next four panels show an analysis of synonymous site conservation in the concatenated coding ORFs (with the reading frame of the longer ORF being used wherever two ORFs overlap). Red lines show the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window (25 or 65 codons, as indicated) could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, whereas brown lines depict the absolute amount of conservation, as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model (obs/exp). Greatly enhanced synonymous site conservation is seen in the region of ORF1a that is overlapped by the U2 ORF. The next three panels show MLOGD coding potential scores and stop codon plots for each of the three reading frames. The positions of stop codons are shown for each of the eight torovirus sequences mapped onto the Breda virus reference sequence coordinates. Note the conserved absence of stop codons in the U1 and U2 ORFs. MLOGD was applied in a 40-codon sliding window (5-codon step size). Positive scores indicate that the sequence is likely to be coding in the given reading frame. Note the positive scores within the U1 and U2 ORFs besides the previously known ORFs. The bottom panel (green line) indicates the total amount of phylogenetic divergence contributing to the analyses at each alignment position (regions containing alignment gaps have reduced summed divergence, leading to reduced statistical power).

The five most significant genes in each category are labeled with the gene symbol, where available, and otherwise with the Ensembl gene identifier. (C) Absolute log2 fold change for all gene ontology (GO) terms which were significantly overrepresented compared to a background of all horse protein-coding genes for genes significantly more transcribed in infected cells (pink), genes significantly more efficiently translated in infected cells (blue), and genes significantly more transcribed in mock cells (green). No terms were identified for genes significantly more efficiently translated in mock cells.",
