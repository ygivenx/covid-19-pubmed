High priority should be given to the prevention of nosocomial infections among the workers and inpatients in the healthcare settings. Since the first human case of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1684 laboratory-confirmed cases and 600 related deaths have been recorded (as of January, 2016) [1]. As a result, great concerns about a potential pandemic arose [2, 3]. Although the majority of cases occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, international spread of MERS due to travel has been reported in at least 20 other countries, with many cases emerging in the healthcare settings [4].",

This suspected case was then quarantined in a negatively pressurized room and confirmed to be infected with MERS on May 29. Strict infection control measures were taken in the hospital where the case was treated to reduce the risk of further transmission. On June 10, serum samples were collected from 53 healthcare workers who used personal protective equipment when treating this patient, and all were confirmed to be MERS-CoV negative [5].",

Over the following weeks, the number of secondary and subsequent cases from this patient increased, leading it to become the largest case cluster of MERS outside the Middle East. All cases (excluding the index case) have been linked to a single chain of transmission and were associated with healthcare facilities [6]. Of these, 30 were secondary cases, 124 were third generation cases, 24 were fourth generation cases, and 0 were fifth generation case. The index patient of the MERS outbreak in South Korea was diagnosed nine days after the onset of symptoms, and was responsible for generating the secondary cases [7]. Nearly two-thirds of the cases have been reported from St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Seoul, Korea, where the air-conditioning system\u2019s lack of ventilators resulted in MERS-CoV being detected in bathrooms and on doorknobs [4]. The ineffective infection control procedures implemented during this MERS outbreak may be attributable to poor nosocomial infection control.",

            "text": "When it comes to emerging infectious diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus disease, and MERS, before the imported case was finally identified or community transmission was reported, cases have often occurred in clusters in healthcare settings. In March 2003, for example, 19 medical staff members, one inpatient, and one family number were infected with SARS-CoV by the same index SARS patient in a hospital in Guangdong [8]. In a Beijing hospital in 2003, 23 first and secondary cases were infected, of which 16 were healthcare workers, two were inpatients, and five were family numbers [9]. In the US, two nurses were infected with the Ebola virus when treating an Ebola patient [10]. A comparative study on the transmission of emerging infectious diseases in the healthcare setting showed that both SARS and MERS were found to be nosocomial super-spread at the early stage, and the reproduction number dropped below 1 within 3 to 5 generations. More SARS cases were found among healthcare workers during the outbreak, while MERS cases occurred among the patients who sought care in the same healthcare settings as the index case [7]. Infection control measures are critical in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare facilities among, for instance, medical personnel who have direct contact with patients, patients sharing an intensive care unit (ICU) room with the case patient, as well as family members visiting inpatients.",

However, in healthcare settings where patients with emerging or unknown infectious diseases are diagnosed and treated, especially those operated by local governments, infection control methods against severe infectious diseases such as MERS are often imperfect. For example, a survey of device-associated healthcare-associated infection (DA-HAI) rates in 398 ICUs in Shanghai, China, reported a high number of DA-HAIs, which posed a major threat to patient safety [11]. Therefore, great efforts are needed to strengthen and enhance the capacity of infectious disease control in local healthcare units. Equipment, facilities, supplies, and standards of operations need to be improved. More importantly, all personnel in healthcare settings, such as doctors, nurses, and administrative and other staff, have to develop their own awareness, essential knowledge, and skills in order to protect themselves against emerging infectious diseases.",
