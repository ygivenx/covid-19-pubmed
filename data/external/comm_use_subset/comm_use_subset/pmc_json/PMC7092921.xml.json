The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the literature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",
