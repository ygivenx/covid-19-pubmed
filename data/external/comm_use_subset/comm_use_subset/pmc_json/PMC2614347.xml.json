            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies in developed countries and is a growing problem in developing countries [1]. There are two major types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC makes up approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases [2] and has a limited response rate to current chemotherapeutic agents, with tumor shrinkage in only 20% of patients and a two-year survival rate between 10% and 16% [3]. One major reason for this unsatisfactory outcome of chemotherapy is compromised drug delivery to the lung cancer tissues due to high interstitial fluid pressures (IFP) within the tumor [4]. Systemically administered chemotherapy cannot be adequately delivered into solid tumors because of the immature vasculature with abnormal architecture [5] and leaky, heterogeneous vessel walls [6] as well as the high IFP within tumor tissues [7], [8]. Furthermore, a lack of tumor specificity allows anti-cancer drugs to distribute indiscriminately to normal organs and tissues. Thus, cancer cells are exposed to a lower concentration of the drug than normal cells [9], resulting in not only decreased effectiveness but also increased toxicity. Therefore, it is important to develop a strategy to enhance the amount of drugs delivered to tumor tissues in a targeted way while sparing normal tissues.",

Compared with conventionally administered chemotherapeutic agents, lipid- or polymer-based nano-medicine drug delivery systems have the advantage of improving the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of cytotoxic drugs [11]. Most small-molecule chemotherapeutic agents have a large volume of distribution on intravenous administration [12] and a narrow therapeutic window due to serious toxicity to normal tissues. By encapsulating drugs in nano-particles such as liposomes, scientists can significantly reduce the volume of distribution and increase the concentration of active drug within the tumor [13]. PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (with brand names of Doxil in the US and Caelyx in Europe) [14] has been shown to significantly improve the therapeutic index of doxorubicin both in preclinical [15]\u2013[17] and clinical studies [18]\u2013[21]. Several drug delivery systems of this kind have been approved for marketing [22], [23].",

In this novel drug delivery system, targeting moieties are coupled to the surface of liposomes to promote selective binding to tumor-specific antigens and facilitate the delivery of drug-containing liposomes to the intended cellular sites. This system has the advantages of a higher drug-to-carrier ratio than immunoconjugates and the multivalent presentation of ligands leading to increased binding avidity [24].

The use of peptides as ligands to direct liposomes to tumors represents a potentially feasible method for increasing the specificity and effectiveness of liposome-containing drugs [26], [30]. Phage display is a technique of selecting targeting peptides, in which a peptide is expressed on the surface of a bacteriophage as a fusion-protein with one of the virion's own coat proteins [31]. Phage-displayed peptide libraries allows researchers to map protein-protein contacts such as B-cell epitopes [32]\u2013[35] and receptor-ligand interactions [36].

Enriched phages from the third to the fifth biopanning rounds were randomly selected. We then sequenced the phage clones with higher CL1-5-binding activities. Using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software analysis, we found that these selected phages (PC3-1, PC4-1, PC4-5, PC5-2 and PC5-4) displayed the consensus motif, tryptophan (W)-threonine (T)/tyrosine (Y)-tyrosine (Y) (Table 1).

We proposed that these three amino acid residues might play a crucial role in homing to tumor tissues. To test this hypothesis, we changed these three amino acid residues in SP5-2 (TDSILRSYDWTY) to GGG in a mutant peptide, MP5-2 (TDSILRSYDGGG). Although the tumor-homing ability of PC5-2 had been markedly inhibited by the peptide SP5-2, this competitive inhibition was lost in MP5-2, which contains the GGG residue instead of the WTY residues in SP5-2 (Fig. 2B).

Specifically, we found a phage clone PC5-2 that made up 90% of the selected phages binding to CL1-5 cells after five rounds of biopanning (Table 1). Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry assays confirmed that PC5-2 bound to NSCLC cell surface. The same binding results were observed in the cognate synthetic peptide SP5-2, which replaced PC5-2 (Fig. 1 and Figs. S1, S2, S3). These experiments supported that this targeting peptide can specifically bind to the cell surface of NSCLC cell lines. In vivo experiments also consolidated the homing ability of the peptide. The expression of the SP5-2 peptide (TDSILRSYDWTY) guides the phage to accumulate in NSCLC xenografts but not in normal organs (Fig. 2). The binding activity of PC5-2 to tumor tissues was inhibited by the synthetic peptide SP5-2 (Fig. 2B), indicating that PC5-2 interacted with NSCLC cells by its displayed peptide and not by another part of the phage particle. That the mutated synthetic peptide, MP5-2, did not inhibit the PC5-2 binding demonstrated the importance of the WTY motif in the binding activity (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this phenomenon was observed in immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens from human lung cancer (Fig. 1D e and f), in animal models for ligand-targeted chemotherapy (Fig. 3A) and in tumor localization of doxorubicin delivered by SP5-2-conjugated targeting liposomes (Figs. 4 and 5A).",

            "text": "In previous studies, doxorubicin has largely been used in cancer treatment because of its broad spectrum of antitumor activity. However, the efficacy of doxorubicin in the treatment of NSCLC remains unsatisfactory with a response rate of 15% [42]. This is in part a result of suboptimal doses within the tumor due to indiscriminate drug distribution throughout the body and severe toxicity to normal tissues and organs. Liposomal encapsulation with a targeting ligand may be an effective strategy to deliver the drug directly to tumor cells. Our data revealed that this peptide markedly increased the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal chemotherapies and resulted in higher survival rates in mice with human lung cancer xenografts, and produced limited side effects on the animals (Fig. 3). This peptide increased the therapeutic index of not only doxorubicin but also of vinorelbine, a vinca alkaloid used to treat advanced NSCLC [3]. Furthermore, we observed decreased vessel density and substantially increased cell apoptosis in tumor tissues after the targeting liposome treatment (Figs. 5B and S6). This ligand-mediated liposomal formulation is potentially superior to conventional anti-cancer therapy for NSCLC.",

These results echo other similar investigations [43], [44]. With prolonged presence of liposomes in circulation, more doxorubicin was taken up by tumor cells than conventional doxorubicin administration (Fig. 4); this finding was further confirmed in fluorescence signaling of doxorubicin in tumor tissues (Fig. 5A). This passive targeting phenomenon of non-ligand conjugated liposomes is called the \u201cenhanced permeability and retention effect\u201d [45], [46]. In our study, the doxorubicin concentration in the LD-treated group was three times that of the FD group (Table S2). However, the tumors in the SP5-2-LD group had even higher doxorubicin concentration that was 1.9- and 2.1-fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups (Table S2). The bioavailable drug in the nuclei of cancer cells in the SP5-2-LD was also 2.6- and 2.4-fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups (Table S2). These results indicated that this peptide directly delivered the chemotherapeutic drug to intended targets. Enhancement of drug accumulation in tumor tissues correlated with the increased therapeutic efficacy (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). The peptide-functionalized liposomes were found to have important clinical potential in a targeted drug delivery system. In order to for them to be used clinically, however, a final targeting liposome construct will need to be selected after each component, i.e. peptide ligands, conjugation methodologies, and liposomal drugs, have been optimized.",

Linking SP5-2 to liposomes containing doxorubicin and vinorelbine increased the therapeutic efficacy and survival rates in mice with human NSCLC xenografts because of enhanced tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor angiogenesis. Quantitation and visualization of doxorubicin levels also showed increased drug concentration in tumor tissues in this formulation, highlighting the enhancement in both the delivery and penetration of doxorubicin into the tumor. Our results indicate that the SP5-2 tumor targeting peptide may be used as imaging probes of NSCLC and targeting ligands for liposomal delivery systems to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy for NSCLC.",
