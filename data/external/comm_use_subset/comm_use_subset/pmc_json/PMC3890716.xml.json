            "text": "To date, numerous active compounds have been identified from I. indigotica and the related species Isatis tinctoria[7]. These compounds are mainly divided into three classes, namely, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids as listed in the Additional file 1: Table S1. Among these ingredients, the pharmaceutical activities of the indole alkaloids are mostly reported. Indirubin, isaindigotone, 5-hydroxyoxindole, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and trytanthrin are validated to be the active substances for the doxorubicin resistance, leukocyte inhibition, and antiviral activities [8-12]. Phenylpropanoids is another major group of active compounds, which is mainly comprised of lignans and flavonoids. Lignans, including pinoresinol, lariciresinol, and lignan glycoside derivatives as lariciresinol-4\u2032-bis-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside were identified as anti-inflammatory and antiviral constituents [13,14]. In addition, compounds such as sitosterols, epigitrin, epiprogoitrin, and hypoxanthine, etc. also are involved in the major drug actions of I. indigotica. However, most of these compounds are presented in I. indigotica at alow natural abundance, such as lariciresinol (0.24\u2030 DW), lariciresinol-4\u2032-bis-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (0.4\u2030 DW), and hypoxanthine (0.49\u2030 DW) [13,15]. Therefore, increasing the content of the active metabolites is of significance for enhancing the quality of I. indigotica, and also meets the growing market requirements.",

With in-depth understanding of biosynthesis, the content of valuable compounds is dramatically increased by bio-engineering techniques in many medicinal plants as Catharanthus roseus[16], Hyoscyamus niger[17], and Salvia miltiorrhiza[18]. However, because of the limited information of biosynthesis pathways, there has been no successful progress on metabolic engineering in I. indigotica until now. Therefore, a deep understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of the various compounds produced by the plant becomes the first imperative. As a non-model plant species, little information was initially available to achieve this goal. In previous studies, the genes involved in lignan synthesis were isolated and characterized, including PAL (DQ115905), C4H (GU014562), 4CL (GU937875), CCR (GQ872418), CAD (GU937874), C3H (JF826963), CCoAOMT (DQ115904), and PLR (JF264893) by homologous cloning [19,20]. Nevertheless, the slow process of homologous cloning has afforded only limited progress toward a complete understanding of these diverse, biosynthetic pathways in I. indigotica. Most of genes involved in secondary metabolites synthesis and the corresponding regulatory genes for these active compounds still remain unclear.",

By this de novo technique, it was possible to identify a set of putative genes involved in the pathways of secondary metabolism, especially those genes related to the biosynthesis of the valuable active compounds. The aim in this research was to establish a candidate gene pool of I. indigotica, and to assist in the discovery of new genes related to the secondary metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, metabolite analysis was carried out following the indications offered by the transcriptome.

After assembly, 36,367 unigenes with an average length of 1,115.67 bp were generated (Additional file 4).

The content of target components after MeJA treatment for 12 h and 24 h was compared with control. The average content of three biological replicates was presented in Figure 6. Isorhamnetin was only detected in the control strain of hairy roots line 1 (Data not shown). Therefore, the content of isorhamnetion was not discussed here. As shown in Figure 6, all detected components showed increased accumulation at different level under MeJA induction. Accumulation of coniferin, coniferin alcohol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol, mataireisnol, and kaempferol increased significantly (p-value < 0.05) at 24 h after treatment. The result showed the phenlyopropanoids synthesis was activated by MeJA corresponding to the transcriptional variation, which indicated the accumaltion pattern of secondary products were mostly correlated with the transcription of their biosynthetic genes.",

UGTs catalyze transfer of the glycosyl group from nucleoside diphosphate-activated sugars (UDP-sugars) to a diverse array of secondary metabolites. Classes of effective compounds in I. indigotica like flavonoids and lignans are production of UGTs. As shown in Figure 2c, flavonoids synthetic genes, including flavonol synthase gene (FLS), flavonoid 3\u2032- hydroxylase gene (F3\u2032H), O-methyltransferase gene (OMT), were annotated. Meanwhile, flavonoids related UGTs (UGT78D1, UGT78D2, UGT73C6, and UGT89C1), were also identified [27-29], which suggested the synthesis of diverse flavonoids in I. indigotica. However, none of this class of flavonoids had ever been reported in I. indigotica. To validate these supposed flavonoids, mass spectrometric analysis was performed using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Profiles of the EIC (extracted ion chromatogram) are presented in Additional file 10. Table 1 showed extract mass, calculated molecular formula, retention time, and the putative flavonoids. As a result, six putative flavonol glycosides were identified in I. indigotica. The result indicated the existence of kaempferol derivatives in I. indigotica.",

Co-expression analysis provides opportunities to explore the potential function of genes [38]. In order to screen the candidate UGTs involved in flavonoid and lignan biosynthesis in I. indigotica, transcriptome co-expression analysis according to expression profile of homologous Arabidopisis UGTs was performed. Homologous Arabidopisis genes, including 52 UGTs, ten flavonol synthesis genes, and nine lignan synthesis genes, were subjected as query. As shown in Figure 7, a total of 45 co-expressed genes showed greater correlation coefficient than 0.5 with at least one other genes, and were mainly classified into four major clusters. Cluster 1 was mainly made up of general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes, including PALs, 4CLs, and C4H, and lignan biosynthesis genes, such as C3H, CCoAoMT, CAD, and CCR. Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 contained flavonoid and lignan correlated genes, respectively. DIR2 and DIR3, which located at downstream of lignan biosynthesis, were classified into cluster 2. In correspondence with DIR2 and DIR3, five UGTs in cluster 2 were regarded as lignan glucosyltransferase genes. In cluster 3, flavone biosynthesis genes CHS, F3\u2032H, and FLS were correlated with four UGTs. Besides UGT78D1 and UGT78D2, which were known to be O-glucosytranferase genes, UGT84A1 and UGT84A2 were predicted to be flavonol glucosyltransferase genes due to the catalytic activity of correlative genes. In cluster 4, UGT75B1 was predicted to be a flavonol glucosyltransferase gene based on the correlation with both cluster 3 and UGT73C6. Beside the major clusters, UGT71D1 might be considered as a lignan glucosyltransferase gene according to the correlation with DIR4. In summary, five UGTs (71C1, 71C2, 71D1, 72E3, and 84A4) were predicted as lignan glucosyltransferases and four UGTs (73C1, 75B1, 84A1, and 84A2) were classified as flavone glucosyltransferases.",

Moreover, the expression patterns experiments of synthetic genes will generate an improved understanding of their functional characteristics. Several genes involved in each of the target pathways were encoded by multiple gene members with different organ specific expression patterns demonstrating the complexity of the biosynthesis of these classes of compounds in I. indigotica. The results supported the view that specific groups of phenylpropanoids [39] and terpenoids [40] were synthesized by specific metabolic channels organized by isoenzymes within the pathways. The distinctive responses to MeJA would provide useful information for improving production of effective components through genetic engineering.
