As biological agents to control pest population, they limit spread of human diseases and prevent significant economic losses on crops and livestock [4\u20137]. Through the production of guano, their accumulated excrement, bats are also responsible for nutrient cycling. As the main source of energy for a wide range of unique species found on specific caves, guano deposits form the basis of cave ecosystems [7]. The formation of bat guano is an interesting interplay among bats as primary producers, the nutrients present in the food they eat and the biological and environmental changes inside the cave ecosystem. Guano is noted for its agricultural benefits as an ideal fertilizer attributed to its richness in carbon, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. In the US, Asia, Cuba and South America, guano is being marketed as the best organic fertilizer available. In the Philippines, caves in the Bicol Region, Pangasinan and Samal (Davao del Norte) are few places that produce abundant guano in high risk of disturbance due to illegal extraction. According to local government officials, guano-mining is inevitable since it is the source of income among the locals and, likewise, a free organic fertilizer for agricultural crops within the vicinity of the caves.",

Fungi like Histoplasma capsulatum [15\u201318], Geomyces destructans [19] and Pseudogymnoascus destructans [20] were reported to be isolated, considered as cause of infection and death in hibernating bats. Although bacterial colonization has been observed only on samples of rocks, cave wall and/or ceiling paintings, dripping waters, springs and underwater passages, oligotrophic cave-dwelling microbial species have been described as phylogenetically diverse with lineages across the breadth of the bacteria. Presence of pathogenic enteric bacteria mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae and some bacterial pathogens common in human and animal diseases (e.g. Pasteurella, Salmonella, Escherichia and Yersinia spp.) [21, 22] was reported to be affected by the foraging habits, diet and activities of the bats inside and outside of caves. Other bacterial pathogens (e.g. Bartonella, Borrelia, Leptospira spp., Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Arthrobacter and Micrococcus spp.) provided evidence for novel species that seem to be specific for bat hosts with probable medical importance to humans and other animals [23\u201326]. These harmful microorganisms may also contribute to continuous decline of bat population in caves. In addition, human-induced environmental stresses such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, overhunting for bush meat, and increased use of pesticides also have negative impact to bat population in caves [4]. Thus a persistent call for global bat conservation is necessary.",

High-throughput screening allows the paradigm shift on microbiology and bioinformatics towards modern metagenomics that augment the limitations of culture-based methods [28, 29]. Availability and accessibility of cost-effective next-generation high-throughput sequencing methods improved understanding of the assembly, evolution and functions of ecological communities. Metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to characterize gut and guano microbiome of several bat species [22, 27, 30\u201332] and feces of different animals to determine their diet as well as the diversity of metabolic functional genes (i.e. enzymes) [33\u201335].",

The chamber was about 9 m at its widest and near a pool of water. The second sample, C2, was collected 77 m further up near the flyway of bats. It is 6 m at its widest with ceiling of 3 to 7 m high [36] and host sizable roost of bats of about 10\u2013100 bat individuals. This chamber is an important flyway for bats roosting further in the cave and host about 1\u201310 bat individuals. The floor of the site was uneven, made of large boulders and rock formations that holds pool of guano. Guano were collected from seven sites in each chamber, pooled and placed inside re-sealable zipper plastic bags using sterile shovel. Composite samples were then brought to the laboratory inside an ice chest and subjected to immediate DNA extraction and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrophotometric analysis.",

The differences may be attributed to the decaying process once the guano were deposited on the ground or on rock crevices. Decomposition of bat guano is affected by various physical and environmental factors [22] and the dynamic nature of the microorganism present. The conversion of organic and inorganic matters by the microorganism present, in turn, results in the change of pH due to the release of ammonia. Thus, the resulting high levels of nutritional contents from major and trace elements are vital components of organic and inorganic compounds used in biosynthesis and energy production supporting the growth and diversification of guano-borne bacteria [48]. Sequentially, high nutrient levels of guano promote the growth of diverse groups of microorganisms.",

This suggested that guano may act as source of microorganisms that could potentially be pathogenic to humans and animals [51]. The frequent intra- and inter-roost movements and long distance migrations of bats enhance the potential of bacterial transmission among individuals [17, 22, 25, 52]. Presence of beneficial bacteria in bats like probiotics can provide vital functions to their host such as processing of skin proteins, freeing fatty acids to reduce invasion of transient microorganisms and inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms [53\u201357]. Pseudomonas spp. isolated from bats, amphibians and plants produce antifungal properties particularly against Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a causative fungus of white-nose syndrome in bats [57]. Dietary habits were, likewise, reported to affect the bat gut microbiome and allow the acquisition and transmission of infectious agents to other bats and organisms inside a cave. [53\u201355]. Indeed, several insects consumed by insectivorous bats have been found to harbor harmful bacteria and indigenous bacteria common in human and animal diseases, including Salmonella, Yersinia or Campylobacter species and several enteric pathogens [22, 25, 54, 58\u201364]. Similarly, contaminated fruits [51] or water [25] might also be possible sources of bacteria.",

            "text": "Comparing guano microbiome data of C1 and C2 samples with data on composite and decaying guano revealed that it was more similar to each other and were highly different in microbial composition. Differences among the samples can be explained by origin, host bat species and its diet, duration of the decaying process or age of the guano and other physicochemical properties. In terms of diet, the identified bats (Miniopterus schebersii, M. australis and Rhinolophus amplixedectus) were observed to be mainly insectivorous, while R. eschenaultia from Robber\u2019s Cave is frugivorous. Phillips et al. (2012) reported that herbivorous and reproductively active bats carried more diverse microbiota than carnivorous and reproductively inactive individuals [68]. According to Carillo-Araujo et al. (2015), diet primarily defined the gut microbiome [62]. Banskar et al. (2016) observed that dietary overlap among frugivorous and insectivorous bats explained the similarities in gut microbial communities [25, 48]. Microbiome profiles observed in fresh and decaying guano might have been affected by the age of the guano or by the decaying process dependent on physical and environmental factors [25]. As the guano age, microorganisms initially present in the guano carry out various biogeochemical processes such as organic and inorganic nutrient cycles leading to changes in pH and nutritional contents determining increase in bacterial growth and diversity. This could explain the difference in microbiome of fresh and decaying guano observed by Banskar et al. 2016 [22]. Microorganisms present on the soil or cave floor where the guano, was obtained also contributed to the differences.",

The microbiome profiles of the Cabalyorisa bat guano exhibited unique characteristics. Metagenomic analysis of OTUs from bat guano revealed it as a source of potentially pathogenic bacteria and/or novel functional genes. Difference on bacterial diversity between C1 and C2 samples may be attributed to differences of host species, diet and other physico-chemical characteristics of the guano and its environmental surroundings. This first report on bat guano collected in Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan stirred scientific interest for possibilities of isolating and characterizing novel bacteria with multiple functions for production of antibiotics and enzymes. On the downside, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria may impose health hazards to local folks harvesting guano for agricultural purposes.",
