            "text": "Single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction is typically applied to purified proteins and macromolecular complexes with the aim of resolving the organization of multi-component assemblies. Until recently, this approach offered primarily domain- or subunit-level structural detail. Even at this resolution, significant information about virus structure and conformational changes is uniquely accessible by cryo-EM. Whereas crystallographic studies of viruses have been most effective in characterizing highly stable forms of viruses and their capsids, with cryo-EM, viruses can readily be examined in different structural states under a range of conditions. This versatility is exemplified by studies of dengue viruses in immature and mature forms [7]. More recently, comparisons of this insect-borne pathogen\u2019s structure at the physiological temperatures of both mosquito vector and human host revealed a large-scale, temperature-dependent conformational change with differences in E protein subunit organization and exposure of the underlying viral membrane [8]. EM studies such as these have deepened our understanding of how a virus can both maintain a robust assembly that protects the genome in the vector and outside the human host, and then transform into a state that is primed for entry and uncoating once a susceptible host cell is encountered.",

Near-atomic resolution structures have been determined by single-particle cryo-EM for icosahedrally symmetrical viruses as diverse as flaviviruses, including dengue [14] and the emergent Zika virus [15], dsDNA viruses such as adenovirus [16] and a thermophilic virus that exists in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park [17], and the dsRNA rotavirus [18], to name a just a few examples. These detailed structures provide insight into residue-level interactions that stabilize capsid assemblies. For surface and capsid proteins that are targets for neutralizing antibodies, by enabling Fab-virus complexes to be studied in a fairly straightforward manner, cryo-EM analysis is proving exceptionally useful for discerning the full epitopes that are recognized by antibodies, including, in some cases, portions of glycan in addition to protein features (e.g., [19\u201321]).",

Near-atomic resolution structures of viral components in the ~400 kDa range, such as polymerase complexes [26] and natively glycosylated surface glycoprotein spikes, are now attainable (Fig 1) [11,19]. Recent single-particle cryo-EM structures of pre-fusion coronavirus S spikes from mouse hemorrhagic virus and a human beta-coronavirus revealed unexpected fusion protein architecture and previously unappreciated structural similarities with paramyxovirus F proteins, suggesting a possible common ancestry [11,12]. In addition, cryo-EM and crystal structures of a soluble, mutation-stabilized form of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein trimer [27,28] as well as a cryo-EM reconstruction of detergent-extracted native Env [29] have resolved controversies that accompanied initial EM models of this biomedically important cell entry machine and target for neutralizing antibodies [30\u201333]. Cryo-EM and crystal structures of a retroviral integration complex have also recently demonstrated that the proteins form an octomeric rather than the previously anticipated tetrameric ring structure [34,35]. These examples demonstrate the rapid advances that cryo-EM is making in the characterization of viral machinery under native solution conditions. In many cases, the samples that can be studied are refractory to crystallization, e.g., they bear flexible glycan chains or membrane-associative domains (or both!).",

One caveat to the interpretation of biological data based on cryo-EM structures stems from the fact that, over the course of image processing to generate a three-dimensional structure, particles from the initial dataset that are in similar conformations are grouped and averaged. This often results in the removal of significant populations of particles from the set used to generate the final, refined structure. The end result may be reconstructed from a small subset of the population that was present in the sample. If a sample exhibits compositional heterogeneity, such as with different numbers of ligands bound to an oligomeric viral glycoprotein spike [27], or conformational heterogeneity, such as with movement of domains in a complex, this can confound the connection between the singular structure that is obtained and behavior of the sample population. Fortunately, new analytical tools are increasingly gaining in ability to parse the heterogeneity that exists within even \u201cpure\u201d specimens and more thoroughly analyze variation within the specimen population.",

In such cases, due to the particle-to-particle variation in morphology, it is not possible to average images of whole viruses to gain more detailed information. Instead, tomography provides a means of gathering three-dimensional structural information by tilting a specimen to image a field of view over a range of angles [2]. This imaging scheme is subject to some basic limitations that result in reduced resolution (on the order of 10 \u00c5 resolution) relative to single-particle cryo-EM. Namely, samples are subjected to significantly higher cumulative doses of ionizing radiation as the same region of interest is imaged with tens of repeated exposures during collection of the tilt-series. In addition, mechanical constraints limit a sample\u2019s tilt angle to ~\u00b170\u00b0, which leads to incomplete structural information and distortion in the resulting reconstructions. This can be alleviated to some extent using dual-tilt configurations, which allow tilt-series along two orthogonal axes to be gathered, providing more complete data. The necessary instrumentation, however, is not as widely available as the more common single-axis setup. The resulting projection images from the tilt-series are computationally reconstructed to generate the tomographic density. This approach has been applied to image ultrastructure of complex viruses starting with herpes simplex virus-1 [36]. More recently, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has been applied to characterize paramyxoviruses, influenza viruses, HIV-1, filoviruses, tailed bacteriophages, and numerous other enveloped viruses (see reviews [37,38] and Fig 1). The resolution attainable by cryo-ET is sufficient to distinguish different surface protein types and their conformational states [39\u201341] as well as to resolve membrane leaflets and the organization of matrix proteins, Gag polyprotein lattices, nucleoprotein complexes, and portal assemblies at unique vertices in otherwise symmetrical capsids. The three-dimensional organization of highly complex, non-symmetrical viruses becomes discernable by cryo-ET.",

Sub-tomogram averaging has provided low-resolution structures of glycoproteins in situ on the surface of virions, including HIV-1 Env (reviewed in [42]), Ebola GP [43,44], and influenza hemagglutinin [39,41]. In the case of Ebola GP, tomography was able to localize the heavily glycosylated mucin domain in the context of a complete GP spike, which had been refractory to crystallization [44]. Sub-tomogram averaging was also recently applied to retroviral Gag lattices in immature HIV-1 particles, yielding sub-nanometer resolution reconstructions in which individual \u03b1-helices and subunit architecture could be discerned [45]. Notably, rather than being derived from images of recombinant, purified components as in single-particle cryo-EM, the 8.8 \u00c5 reconstruction by Schur et al. [45] and the studies of viral surface glycoproteins were based upon imaging of the components within the context of the intact virus or virus-like particles. With further improvements in imaging technology and data analysis, tomography-based structures are likely to increase in resolution. This may at last realize a long-standing goal of extracting high-resolution structures from authentic biological contexts.",

Seminal studies of virus entry into cells in the early 1980s using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of thin-section, plastic embedded cells (e.g., [54]) provided evidence for endocytic uptake. Such methods, however, are limited in resolution and can suffer in preservation of native cellular structures. Recent studies have used cryo-ET of unfixed specimens to image viruses in cells and tissues. Groundbreaking studies of HSV-1 entry and intracellular trafficking in neurons were among the first to advance structural virology into the realm of cell biology (Fig 1) [51,55]. Enveloped virus assembly at budding sites has been imaged, offering insights into virion morphogenesis (e.g., [56,57]). Interferon-induced antiviral processes against budding HIV-1, mediated by tetherin, have also been imaged recently by cryo-ET, illustrating the interplay of host cell and virus in a native biological context [58]. Lastly, in a cryo-ET study of infected cyanobacteria, assembly intermediates of the cyanophage Syn5 in the intracellular environment of its Synechococcus host were imaged at nanometer resolution [59].

Cryo-microtomy, which involves shaving thin slices of unfixed, flash-frozen specimens followed by cryo-ET, enables thick samples to be deconstructed into layers; however, this technically challenging technique is susceptible to the introduction of artifacts and distortion during the preparation of specimens [61,62]. Another approach that has made inroads into analysis of thicker specimens employs a focused ion beam to mill away strata of a thick specimen above and below a layer of interest, which may lie within thicker regions of a cell [61,63].

Right: Cryo-ET is also being used to image viruses in the context of intact cells as in this example that examined HSV-1 transport along an axon of an intact neuron [55]; a) shows the neuron grown on an EM grid that is punctuated by 2 \u03bcm holes in the carbon film, b) shows a close-up view of a portion of the axon that spans across a hole, and c) shows the reconstructed cryo-electron tomogram with an HSV-1 core particle highlighted by the box. (Scale bars: A 6 \u03bcm; B,C 200 nm). Taken together, these types of cryo-EM-based structural approaches are bringing viral infectious cycles into clearer view.",
