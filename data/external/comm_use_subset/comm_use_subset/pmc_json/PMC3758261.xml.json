Timely identification of RNA viruses is of great significance in the diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of human and animal infectious diseases [11]. However, this work is quite difficult if the RNA virus has not been discovered in the past. For example, it took multiple years to identify hepatitis C virus as the etiological agent of most non-A non-B infectious hepatitis in the 1980s [12]. It also took several months for scientists to identify the SARS coronavirus (CoV) in 2003 [4], [5].",

Several coronaviruses from mammals have also been placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, including a Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 [21], [22], [24]. IBV circulates widely in many regions in the world, and can cause acute and highly contagious respiratory diseases in chickens of all ages and diminish egg production in hens [23]. Control of the disease is mainly based on vaccination, but antigenic changes of the virus may result in incomplete protection through vaccination. Although chickens are the primary natural hosts of IBVs, several studies have identified IBV-like viruses in turkeys, ducks, geese and pigeons [24]\u2013[27]. Due to the fact that few genomic sequences of these IBV-like viruses circulating in domestic fowls other than chickens or turkeys have been identified, the taxonomy of these IBV-like viruses remains uncertain. For example, complete or partial genomic sequences of only one duck IBV-like virus have been reported in GenBank. Additionally, partial genomic sequences of 39 goose IBV-like viruses isolated in only one country (Norway) have been reported in GenBank, and 33 of the sequences are only 208 bp in length covering a short and conserved region in the viral 1b gene [28].",

On the other side, if the region in the viral genome is highly variable, the detection may be insensitive in identifying the target virus, although the sequences of the region may be useful in the phylogenetic analysis. Considering these factors, we selected a moderately conserved region in the genomes of IBV and IBV-like viruses, namely a region of the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene, rather than the highly variable spike (S) gene or the highly conserved replicase genes, 1a or 1b (Figure 1), as the target of the survey in this study.",

The results suggested that the 1b1, 1b2 and 1b3 sequences were distinct with their counterparts of IBVs (Figure 2). The mean identities in the amino acid sequences between DK2012-CoV and the 13 IBVs were 87.30% in 1b1, 86.37% in 1b2 and 86.66% in 1b3. By contrast, the mean amino acid sequence identities between DK2004-CoV and the 13 IBVs were 95.99% in 1b1, 95.35% in 1b2, and 97.31% in 1b3, similar to the mean amino acid sequence identities within the 13 IBVs, 97% in 1b1, 94.38% in 1b2, and 97.31% in 1b3 (Figure 3). These data suggested that DK2004-CoV and IBVs belong to the same species, and DK2012-CoV identified in this study represents a potential novel species, according to the nomenclature standard of CoVs that CoVs of amino acid sequence identity <90% in the domains of the viral replicase genes (1a and 1b) could be assigned to a novel species [1].",

Secondly, during the extraction of viral RNA, it is tough to completely delete rRNA from the host and some bacteria, even though rRNA deletion products have been available to minimize the inference of rRNA of the host and some bacteria [35]\u2013[37]. Consequently, many RNA-Seq reads belong to rRNA of cellular organisms. Thirdly, if the viral reads are highly divergent from any known viruses, no hits may be found for these viral reads. The RNA-Seq used in this study is based on Ion Torrent PGM, which is a small and relatively cheap NGS sequencer with much less throughput, compared to some other NGS sequencers, such as Hi-Seq of Illumina or Roche 454 FLX Sequencers [38]. Possibly for these factors, we have obtained only several contigs rather than the full genome of DK2012-CoV through RNA-Seq.",

For example, Clade 1 was largely specific to chickens, and Clade 3 was specific to pigeons, Clade 4 was specific to ducks and Clade 5 specific to geese, while Clade 2 and Subclade 1.3 specific to Australia, Subclade 1.2 largely specific to Taiwan, and Subclades 1.5 and 1.6 specific to mainland China. The host-specific clades or subclades may result from that different virus strains are of different efficiencies in replication in different hosts. This may lead to separate replication and circulation of different clades or subclades of the CoVs in different hosts, similar to reproduction isolation of higher organisms. Although the viral spike gene is directly involved in the viral receptor-binding, the replication isolation can also act on the viral N gene through genetic hitchhiking [30]. The region-specific clades or subclades may result from geographical isolation caused by the limited transmission ability of the virus and the spatial isolation of the regions (e.g. Australia and Taiwan are both separate islands). The explanation of the specificity of the clades and subclades, in turn, supports the theory that replication or reproduction isolation and geographical isolation is important in speciation [43], [44].",
