            "text": "Avian species serve as hosts for a diversity of viruses that pose both biosecurity and zoonotic risks. Numerous outbreaks of disease in collections of caged birds and commercial domestic poultry have been attributed to viruses introduced by direct or indirect contact with wild birds [1\u20137]. Some avian viruses can also cause disease in humans [8\u201314]. As such, understanding the viruses present in wild birds is important for managing potential risks to human and animal health, and for understanding the biology of these viruses in their natural hosts. Studying viruses in wild birds can be challenging as gaining access to these birds for the purpose of sample collection can be difficult, and their capture may be a cause of stress or injury. Collecting and testing samples from avian patients presenting to veterinary hospitals can be a convenient and useful approach to detecting and studying avian viruses. Importantly this approach does not involve additional capturing or handling of birds, and allows the risks to staff and other avian patients/collections within the facility to be more accurately assessed, since the species from which the samples are collected reflects the species being handled at the participating facility. This approach has been successful in previous studies utilizing veterinary hospitals and wildlife rescue centres in several countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, France and Belgium [15\u201318].",

Patients may be presented to the AWHC by members of the public, wildlife carers, keepers, government wildlife officers or by referral from other veterinary clinics for veterinary diagnosis and treatment. During this period in captivity there is an elevated risk of stress-induced shedding of pathogens, presenting a risk for both the veterinary staff and other animals in care, including the Sanctuary\u2019s collection animals and captive breeding programs. Close contact between infected and susceptible animals can facilitate the transmission of pathogens between species, particularly when the hosts are taxonomically related. The large number of avian patients passing through the AWHC provides an opportunity to study the viruses present in Australian birds and better understand the potential risks these viruses present.",

            "text": "Of particular importance and conservation value at Healesville Sanctuary are the captive breeding and insurance programs for threatened species. This includes a captive breeding program for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster), which is facing imminent extinction in the wild [19]. The orange-bellied parrot is arguably the most threatened parrot species in the world, with the wild-bred population declining to only three females and 13 male birds in the 2016/2017 breeding season [19]. Infectious diseases, including viral diseases, are a recognized threat to this and other threatened bird species both within Australia and around the world. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), a circovirus, is of particular concern [20]. Our past work has shown that BFDV is prevalent in both psittacine and non-psittacine birds presenting to the AWHC, and has revealed that non-psittacine birds may represent a previously unrecognized risk for spreading BFDV infection [21]. Other viruses are also a potential threat to Psittaciformes in Australia. Psittacid alphaherpesvirus 1 (PsHV1) is the aetiologic agent of both Pacheco\u2019s disease and mucosal papillomas in Psittaciformes [22]. PsHV1 has not been reported in wild Psittaciformes in Australia [23], but has been detected in Australia in captive green-winged macaws (Ara chloropterus) imported from the United Kingdom in the 1990s [23, 24]. It is not known how far the virus has been transmitted from these birds but it is likely to be present in at least some avicultural collections in Australia [23]. The inadvertent introduction of such a virus into the remaining population of a threatened avian species, such as through the Neophema chrysogaster recovery program, would be potentially devastating. Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) also pose a threat to Australian Psittaciformes. Avian avulavirus 3 (previously avian paryamyxovirus serotype 3, APMV-3) has been documented causing mortality rates of up to 70% in captive collections of Neophema species and other Australian psittacines overseas [25\u201328]. APMV-3 strains have been isolated from a diversity of avian species in different parts of the world, but has not yet been reported in Australia [25\u201331]. However we do know that the Australian parrot genus Neophema is highly susceptible to APMV-3, with infection frequently resulting in fatal neurological disease [26, 28]. Another avian paramyxovirus, Avian avulavirus 5 (avian paramyxovirus 5, APMV-5) has caused outbreaks of severe disease with up to 100% mortality in captive budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), including an outbreak in a captive budgerigar flock in Queensland in 1972 [25, 32\u201334].",

Wild birds, particularly waterfowl, waders and sea birds, are the natural reservoirs of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and play important roles in the circulation of AIVs [35\u201338], with potential for transmission of AIVs both to and from poultry and the potential for mutation to generate highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses [6, 7, 39]. Some AIVs can be transmitted from poultry to humans, and some have caused severe disease or even death in humans [8, 9, 11\u201313, 40, 41]. Transmission of AIVs from wild birds to commercial poultry has occurred recently in Australia in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland [10, 42\u201345]. The Australian National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance Program has been in place since 2006 but primarily targets Anseriformes (ducks, swans, geese) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns and shorebirds) [46, 47]. The prevalence of AIV infection in birds presenting to veterinary care facilities, such as the AWHC, has not been as comprehensively studied [15]. In Australia, avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) are also of particular interest in wild birds because of the presence of variant forms of the poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Australian commercial poultry [48\u201350]. It is suspected that the variant IBV strains contain genetic material derived from AvCoVs hosted by wild birds, but this requires further investigation [48].",

Four virus families were targeted in this study: avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Samples were screened using a combination of genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. Two novel viruses were detected in this study, hence contributing to our knowledge of avian virodiversity, while the overall low level of virus detection adds to our understanding about the presence or absence of viruses of birds in Australia and their potential risk to avian and human health.",

This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences of the University of Melbourne (Ethics ID #1413397). Of these 409 birds, 299 were wild avian patients presented to the AWHC for veterinary care, while 110 were captive (part of the Healesville Sanctuary collection). Information regarding the location, date, species and any other available and relevant details about the bird\u2019s history, including reason for admittance, were collected at the time of admission by AWHC staff. A clinical examination was performed by a veterinarian after admission, with any observed clinical signs and diagnostic findings being recorded, including body condition as judged by palpation of pectoral muscle mass. Samples were collected from live avian patients or at necropsy (from birds that had been euthanased or died for reasons unrelated to this study). Most samples collected from live birds were opportunistically taken whilst birds were anesthetised using inhalational isoflurane (Delvet Isoflurane) and oxygen delivered via mask to facilitate clinical examination and diagnostic investigations, and all efforts were made to minimise animal stress and discomfort. Sterile rayon-tipped dry swabs (Copan Italia) were first moistened by dipping in sterile phosphate buffered saline, then used to separately swab the choana and cloaca of 199 live birds (107 wild and 92 captive avian patients). The tips of these swabs were cut into 500 \u03bcL of RNAlater\u00ae (Ambion) and stored at -20\u00b0C. For the 210 birds sampled at post-mortem (comprising 192 deceased wild birds and 18 birds originating from the Healesville Sanctuary collection), sterile dry swabs were used to separately swab the trachea and intestine/caecum, cut into 500 \u03bcL of RNAlater\u00ae and stored at -20\u00b0C. A piece of liver was also aseptically collected and stored at either -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C. The collection of these liver samples, and their subsequent testing for BFDV, has been previously reported in a separate study [21]. Instruments used for post-mortem sample collection were cleaned and autoclaved between each necropsy. Samples of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, gonad, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, large intestine (including caecae if present, depending on bird species), pectoral muscle, skin, brain and any lesions were also collected and fixed by submersion in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin at necropsy. For a few select birds of interest, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological examination.",

Products amplified by PCR were separated on agarose gels using SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) and visualised by UV transillumination using Bio-Rad Image Lab Software.

Both sets of degenerate primers target the same conserved region of the L-protein-coding sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene\u2013the most conserved viral gene in the family Paramyxoviridae [53]. PAR-F1 was coupled with PMX2 to produce amplicons of approximately 120 bp in size, while PMX1 coupled with PAR-R produced amplicons of approximately 650 bp in size.

PhyML 2.2.0 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for the herpesviruses were generated from ClustalW2 [59] nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments using the general-time-reversible nucleotide substitution and Jones-Taylor-Thornton amino acid substitution models respectively, each with four substitution rate categories [60]. For the phylogenetic analysis of the family Paramyxoviridae, a ClustalW2 alignment [59] was used to draw a PhyML 2.2.0 maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using the HKY85 nucleotide substitution model with four substitution rate categories [60]. For each of these trees the reliability of each branch was tested using 100 replicates in a bootstrap resampling analysis.",

This cockatoo tested positive for BFDV when DNA extracted from a liver sample collected at post-mortem was used as template in a BFDV PCR assay [21, 70]. Histopathological examination of samples of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and ovarian tissue collected at necropsy revealed chronic enteritis with unidentified piriform protozoa in intestinal crypts and foci of mucosal and crypt necrosis with interstitial fibrosis in the submucosa of the proximal small intestine, along with a significant overgrowth of Macrorhabdus ornithogaster in the ventriculus. It is presumed that the protozoan and Macrorhabdus overgrowth were secondary to immunosuppression caused by BFDV infection, but it is unknown what role the newly identified alphaherpesvirus may have been playing in this emaciated and very unwell bird. No inclusion bodies, inflammation in the lungs nor any other sign of herpesvirus infection were seen in any of the tissues examined histologically.

It is likely that the sample population in this present study, particularly the low numbers of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes (28 of the 408 birds tested) contributed to the absence or low prevalence of detection of AIVs, APMVs and AvCoVs, as previous studies have shown that these viruses are present mainly in the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes [3, 15, 36, 38, 46, 72\u201374]. The risk-based Australian National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance Program detected a low prevalence (1.7%) of AIVs in 66,987 Australian wild birds between 2005 and 2012 using a study population containing over 90% Anseriformes or Charadriiformes [46, 47]. This contrasts with the results from this study where AIVs were not detected in any of the birds sampled. Together these results suggest that, although low pathogenic AIVs are circulating at low prevalence in wild birds (particularly those belonging to the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) in Australia [46, 47], there is a low risk of AIV infection in birds presenting for veterinary care at the AWHC.",

These primers detect gammacoronaviruses of the IBV lineage, but do not appear to detect deltacoronaviruses. Whilst the present study was interested in investigating an hypothesised wild bird AvCoV origin of genetic components of variant IBV strains infecting commercial poultry in Australia [48, 50], future use of a pan-Coronaviridae PCR assay to test Australian wild bird samples for AvCoVs would be useful for gaining a more general understanding of AvCoVs in Australia. Future studies focused on elucidating the origin of variant IBV in Australian poultry may be best focused on species of wild birds known to be in closest contact with commercial poultry, such as introduced (feral) passerine birds that commonly live in close proximity to humans and domestic animal production facilities, like European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) [77, 78].",

The complete genome sequences of strains of other avian paramyxoviruses have provided evidence for the existence of genetic subgroups within their respective serotypes [30, 81, 82]. Analysis of the same region of the RNA polymerase gene for which we have sequence information in the present study shows the different subgroups of APMV-2, APMV-3 and APMV-6 have 72.7\u201378.2%, 73.1% and 75.5\u201376.2% nucleotide sequence identity respectively within their serotypes [30, 81, 82]. By comparison, the APMV strain detected from the musk lorikeet in this study has 77.4\u201377.6% nucleotide identity with the APMV-5 sequences obtained from budgerigars in Japan in the 1970s [34, 71]. This suggests that the avian avulavirus detected in this study represents a novel genetic subgroup or genotype of the serotype Avian avulavirus 5, but this putative classification can only be confirmed if the virus can be isolated in the future for antigen-based testing and more extensive genome sequencing. Formal classification of APMV strain musk lorikeet/Melbourne/ML22-141263/2014 will require more genomic sequence information than the 603 bp of the RNA polymerase gene that was obtained in the current study. The clinical significance of this possible novel APMV-5 genotype in other Psittaciformes, such as those in involved in threatened species recovery programs, is also undetermined.",

Many species of Australian parrots are susceptible to APMV-3 and/or PsHV1 infection and disease [26\u201328, 83], so the potential establishment of both viruses in Australia poses significant risks to Australian Psittaciformes and their conservation [23], particularly to breeding programs for threatened species, such as the orange-bellied parrot captive breeding program at Healesville Sanctuary. Both APMV-3 and PsHV1 have been reported in numerous Australian psittacine species held in captivity overseas, and have caused significant mortality events in avicultural collections in other countries [23, 26\u201328, 83]. APMV-3 has not yet been reported in Australia [25\u201331], while PsHV1 has not been reported in wild Psittaciformes in Australia [23]. However it is known that PsHV1 entered Australia in captive green-winged macaws and is likely to present at a low prevalence in some avian collections, where latently infected parrots may be potential sources of virus dissemination [22]. Ongoing surveillance of both wild and captive Psittaciformes for these viruses is vital for detecting and managing potential outbreaks of these pathogens should they be introduced into Australia\u2019s avifauna. Our results showing an absence of PsHV1 in the sampled birds are consistent with results from a serologic survey for PsHV1 in Australian psittacines from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, where all 411 wild and captive birds tested were negative for the presence of neutralizing antibody to PsHV1 [84].",

CoHV1 infection had previously been documented in three species of native birds of prey in Australia: powerful owls, barking owls (Ninox connivens) and an Australian hobby (Falco longipennis) [65]. The virus causes herpesviral inclusion body disease or inclusion body hepatitis in birds of prey (considered aberrant hosts of this virus) when they ingest infected natural hosts of CoHV1 (rock doves or rock pigeons (Columba livia)) [62, 64\u201366, 85, 86]. A recent study has suggested that CoHV1 is enzootic in feral pigeon flocks in Australia, with CoHV1 DNA detected in samples from 81% of 53 feral pigeons from five flocks in Victoria and New South Wales [64]. This recent study also tested oral swabs from 18 Australian native columbids by PCR and all were found to be negative for CoHV1 DNA [64]. The present study tested six wild native Australian pigeons and 28 captive native Australian pigeons and doves. CoHV1 DNA was not detected from any of these birds, suggesting that native columbids are not likely to be a reservoir of CoHV1 infection in Australia.",

            "text": "The two novel herpesviruses detected in this study, tentatively designated CacHV1 and PodHV1, are interesting additions to our knowledge of herpesviruses in avian species. The genetic identification of previously undiscovered avian viruses is essential for mapping disease spread by the international trade in birds, managing biosecurity and disease outbreaks in aviaries, and managing threatened birds being bred for release for conservation of their species [87]. The 485 bp sequence obtained from the tawny frogmouth and the 489 bp sequence obtained from the sulphur-crested cockatoo showed 76% and 66.5% nucleotide identities to the most genetically similar known herpesviruses (CoHV1 and PsHV1, respectively). This level of identity in this highly conserved region of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene is sufficient to indicate that the viruses are new species. As a comparison, there is 82% nucleotide identity at this same region between the distinct but closely related species Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV1 and EHV4, respectively), but there is 100% nucleotide identity at this same region between different isolates of EHV1 and 100% identity between different isolates of EHV4 [88]. Serological cross neutralization has been reported between closely related alphaherpesviruses [89], thus the presence of the newly detected CacHV1 should be considered if any future serological surveys for PsHV1 return positive results. The phylogenetic analyses of sequence data in the present study is sufficient to place the newly detected viruses in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae (Figs 1 and 2), but insufficient to classify PodHV1 and CacHV1 beyond subfamily level. The clinical significance of these viruses remains undetermined, and more extensive genome sequencing will be required for the formal naming, description and classification of these previously unknown avian herpesviruses through the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.",

The detection of two previously unknown viruses has contributed to our knowledge of avian viral communities and their diversity in Australia. Future studies incorporating deep sequencing methods could be expected to possibly uncover more avian viruses and make further contributions to our understanding of avian virodiversity.",
