The strain 83P-5, attenuated by one-hundred cell culture passages, is a subgroup I isolate that has been licensed in Japan as an attenuated live PEDV vaccine [13]. During the attenuation process, this strain acquired fourteen amino acid changes in the immunodominant spike (S) protein, which is critical for virus binding to cell receptors and is the target of neutralizing antibodies [14-19]. The live attenuated DR13 vaccine strain of PEDV, whose parent strain was a subgroup II had thirteen of these fourteen mutations as well, and subsequently clustered with subgroup I [13]. Serial passage of 83P-5 in Vero cells resulted in attenuation of virulence in vivo and the strong selection for the viral spike (S) gene was associated with these phenotypic changes.",

In vivo, high-passage (x > 100) MLVs were attenuated in sows and piglets while still capable of inducing a robust immune response [20]. While attenuated in their ability to cause disease, the safety of using MLV has been questioned, as MLV are shed in the environment. Virus was detected in feces of 3-day old piglets up to seven days after oral inoculation with DR13 passage 100 [12,21] . In 2010, PEDV was isolated from diarrheic pigs in China that had a close phylogenetic relationship to two MLV vaccines, suggesting it may have evolved from a MLV [22].",

In late 2010, China experienced a severe outbreak of PEDV in suckling pigs, causing drastic economic losses [24]. This outbreak was caused by a strain with a phylogenetically distinct S gene from other Chinese strains and from vaccine strain CV777 [24]. In 2012, the PEDV infection rates in vaccinated herds in China increased dramatically. Phylogenetic analysis of new variants from the outbreak showed insertions and deletions in antigenic regions of the S gene that may have influenced the efficacy of the CV777 MLV [25]. Investigation into whether an inactivated vaccine can elicit a protective immune response could lead to the development of vaccines more closely related to field strains and avoid potential antigenic changes due to excessive in vitro cultivation.",

With mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets and total losses estimated over 5 million animals in the U.S. in less than one year, PEDV vaccines are critically needed (www.aasv.org). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allows for the production of autogenous vaccines to address emerging diseases; however the difficulty in isolating PEDV in cell culture increases the difficulty in producing efficacious inactivated vaccines. Here, PEDV was isolated from pooled intestinal homogenate and passaged in cell culture. Inactivated cell culture derived viral vaccines were immunogenic when administered to na\u00efve pigs. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of immunogenicity of an inactivated U.S. PEDV vaccine trial in pigs in the U.S.",

Inactivation was performed by the addition of 0.1 M binary ethyleneimine (BEI) to a final volume of 5% and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. Excess BEI was neutralized with sodium thiosulfate. Virus inactivation was verified by passaging the inactivated fluids three times on permissive cells, resulting in no evidence of CPE or increase in rt-RT-PCR titer. Concentration was performed using a 10kD hollow fiber filter (Spectrum Labs). Due to the space constraints and the number of study groups, vaccination groups receiving 8.0 log10 TCID50/mL antigen consisted of more pigs than groups receiving lower levels of antigen as they were anticipated to show the most robust immune response (Table 1). Groups 1\u20133 were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) in the neck with 2 mL of 8.0, 7.0 or 6.0 log10 TCID50/mL, respectively, of inactivated virus. Groups 5\u20137 were vaccinated IM in the neck with 2 mL of 8.0, 7.0 or 6.0 log10 TCID50/mL, respectively, of inactivated virus treated with Triton\u00ae X-100 (added to 0.1% and incubated at room temperature 30 minutes) (Sigma). Groups 4 and 8 were vaccinated in the rear flank with 8.0 log10 TCID50/mL of inactivated virus and inactivated virus treated with Triton\u00ae X-100, respectively. This was done to evaluate any potential changes in immune response due to a change in vaccination site. All vaccines were formulated to contain 67% TS6, a proprietary oil in water adjuvant. Pigs were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and observed for adverse vaccine reactions for one hour. Animals were also observed daily for signs of disease. Serum was collected on days 0, 21 and 35, and the study was terminated at day 35. Fecal swabs were collected three days post vaccination and were tested by rt-RT-PCR to confirm absence of PEDV shedding.",

Its high genetic homology to the other circulating strains in the U.S. makes it a suitable candidate for investigation of U.S. PEDV inactivated vaccine immunogenicity in pigs. While there is data published regarding the efficacy of attenuated MLVs in Asia, there is limited published data on the immunogenicity of inactivated or subunit PEDV vaccines. This study demonstrates that inactivated PEDV vaccines are immunogenic is pigs.",

A dose response was observed by FFN for vaccines containing different virus titers, with 8.0 log10 TCID50/mL groups all being significantly greater than 6.0 log10 TCID50/mL groups. Vaccines were administered IM or in the rear flank to determine if the site of administration would affect overall immunogenic response. The flank vaccination site was only tested on the 8.0 log10 TCID50/mL groups, as we expected them to have the highest immune response; however there was no significant difference between the two sites of administration. Likewise, there was no significant difference between vaccines formulated with Triton\u00ae X-100 treated antigen, by FFN. A challenge model is needed to correlate FFN and/or ELISA titers to protection.",

The t-test shows Triton\u00ae X-100 treated groups were significantly different from non- Triton\u00ae X-100 treated groups at the same titer for ELISA and FMIA. Triton\u00ae X-100 detergent is used to create split-virion vaccines of influenza virus that are immunogenic and non-reactogenic [31]. Our data suggests that Triton\u00ae X-100 treatment of the PEDV antigen altered the antigenicity or immunogenicity of the NP, leading to negative ELISA results, while other immunogens capable of inducing a neutralizing antibody response detected by the FFN assay remained intact. The two ELISA tests and the FMIA all utilize NP antigen. Triton\u00ae X-100 treatment of the vaccine may have altered the conformation of the virion NP such that antibody induced by this antigen was not able to recognize the recombinant NP used in the ELISA or FMIA. An assay, such as the FFN, that detects functional neutralizing antibody associated with epitopes on the S protein may be better at quantifying antibody response to Triton\u00ae X-100 treated viruses. Few ELISAs targeting the S protein are readily available and they may also be subject to variations in protein conformation associated with Triton\u00ae X-100 treatment.",

Previous work with attenuated virus used to vaccinate sows showed an immune response by ELISA in serum and colostrum, but could not draw a specific correlation to the level of mucosal immunity needed to confer protection [32]. Another study showed antibody was detected in serum from piglets and colostrum from pregnant sows after being inoculated with attenuated PEDV, though finding a specific protective antibody titer of the colostrum was complicated due to varying factors including litter size, colostrum uptake per piglet, antibody concentration, and quality of colostrum [20]. Due to biosecurity concerns, a post-vaccination challenge was not performed for this study. This should be done in the future to determine immune correlates of protection.",

In one case, piglets born from re-infected sows were reported to suffer around 30% mortality instead of near 100% during the first outbreak [33]. Further research is necessary to determine if secondary outbreaks in sows could be prevented via vaccination and or boosters. While this study focused on the humoral immune response in sera from vaccinated pigs, the post-vaccination immune response in sows and antibody titers in colostrum should be studied as the optimal vaccination regimen would utilize maternal antibodies to protect pigs when they are most susceptible to PEDV. Additionally, inactivated vaccines may prove efficacious when used as a booster in conjunction with live exposure or following MLV. If there is risk of re-infection among previously exposed herds, an inactivated vaccine booster to pregnant sows could reduce the occurrence of re-infection and limit secondary outbreaks. PEDV continues to be a source of economic loss and will continue to have a profound impact on the swine market in the U.S.",
