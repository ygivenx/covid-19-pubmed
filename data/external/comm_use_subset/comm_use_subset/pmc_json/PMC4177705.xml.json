Therefore, liver cells possess an effective antioxidant defense system consisting of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) to reduce oxidative stress. To date, however, insufficient work has been done to study the role of oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of DVH. Hepatic injury reflects disturbances in liver cell metabolism, which cause characteristic changes in serum enzyme activities. Elevated serum enzymes are indicative of cellular leakage and the loss of functional integrity of affected hepatocytes [8]. Damage to the liver cell plasma membrane causes the release of liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into blood vessels, while the levels of total protein (TP), albumin, and globulin are decreased in overt hepatitis [9]. Therefore, the serum levels of these markers are useful for assessing the extent and type of hepatocellular damage.",

            "text": "One of the most important properties of flavonoids is their potent antioxidant activity. Flavonoids exert their antioxidant activity by scavenging or quenching free radicals, by chelating metal ions, or by inhibiting the enzymatic systems responsible for producing free radicals [10,11]. Like other flavonoids, epimedium flavones exhibit many biological activities and pharmacological effects, including antioxidant,anti-aging, antitumor, and anti-osteoporosis activities [12-15]. Icariin (C33H40O15, molecular weight: 676.6617) is the main component of epimedium flavones [16]. Because icariin shows poor water solubility, we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin), which showed significantly increased water solubility compared with native icariin. In our previous study, icariin and p-icariin prevented DHV-1 from invading duck embryonic hepatocytes in vitro, with p-icariin showing greater antiviral properties than icariin. To investigate the potential of icariin and p-icariin for preventing DVH, we determined the changes in markers of hepatic injury and oxidative damage, and examined correlations among these markers in the present. To establish an effective clinical treatment for DVH, we also compared the effects of icariin and p-icariin, focusing on their effects on oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH.",

The Fourier transform\u2013infrared spectra of icariin and p-icariin were recorded using a Nicolet 200 Magna-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The pre-modification and post-modification waveforms were basically identical, indicating that icariin and p-icariin have similar structures.

            "text": "Oxidative stress is attributed to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant defense mechanisms of a cell or tissue, causing lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and the inactivation of many enzymes [17]. Lipid peroxidation by free radicals leads to the oxidative destruction of polyunsaturated fatty acids that form the cellular membranes. The destruction of polyunsaturated fatty acids results in the production of toxic and reactive aldehyde metabolites such as MDA [18]. Therefore, the MDA content reflects the extent of lipid peroxidation and is an indirect marker for the extent of hepatocyte injury in vivo [19]. In addition, NO and superoxide radicals interact to form peroxinitrite, which is an important mediator of free radical toxicity [6]. iNOS is expressed in hepatocytes and macrophages and produces abundant NO in response to cytokines, a process that may exacerbate lipid peroxidation-induced hepatocyte injury. It was reported that viral infection increases iNOS mRNA expression and NO production. In turn, NO promotes viral replication in infected cells [20-23]. In our study, at 54 h after exposure to DHV-1, iNOS and MDA levels were significantly greater in the VC group than in BC group. These changes were associated with increased severity of liver disease. Their levels were significantly reduced in ducklings treated with icariin and p-icariin groups, which indicates that both components are capable of attenuating peroxidation-related injury (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The enzymatic antioxidant defense system serves to protect against lipid peroxidation. The main enzymes in this system are SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px, which act cooperatively or synergistically to protect cells from oxidative stress. However, optimal protection is only achieved when the activities of these enzymes reach an appropriate balance [24]. At 8 h after exposure to DHV-1, the plasma GSH-Px, SOD, and catalase levels were not significantly different among the four groups, which indicates that the free radical levels were balanced with the enzyme levels during the initial stage of infection. However, by 54 h, the levels of these enzymes were significantly lower in the VC group than in the BC group. SOD protects against superoxide radicals, which damage the cell membrane and its integrity. Catalase primarily decomposes H2O2 to H2O, like GSH-Px, but at a much faster rate [25]. GSH-Px may also play an important role in the removal of lipid hydroperoxides [26]. The balance between these enzymes is important for the efficient removal of oxygen radicals from tissues [27]. Therefore, a reduction in the enzyme levels of one or more of these enzymes may have deleterious effects following the accumulation of superoxide radicals and H2O2. Notably, we found significant increases in the levels of these enzymes in the icariin and p-icariin groups relative to the VC group, and the levels were similar to those in the BC group (Figure 3). These results indicate that icariin and p-icariin attenuate oxidative stress following exposure to DHV-1, and highlight the potential for reducing liver injury during treatment of viral infection. The significant negative correlations between indices of liver injury (i.e. ALT and LDH) and indices of oxidative stress (i.e. SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px) also support these results. Intriguingly, there were no significant differences in the antioxidant properties of phosphorylated and native icariin.",

In our study, we found that the serum ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH levels were significantly greater in the VC group than in the BC in the late stage of infection (i.e., at 54 h), which indicates that DHV-1 caused severe liver injury. Serum ALT levels were lower in the icariin and p-icariin groups than in the VC group and were similar to those in the BC group. These results indicated that icariin and p-icariin attenuate liver injury, reducing the release of ALT into blood. The modest increases of serum AST in the VC group in the early stage of infection indicate that hepatocytes, or at least mitochondria, were not severely damaged, although DHV-1 did reduce the integrity of the hepatocytes (Table 2). The serum AST levels were significantly higher in the icariin and p-icariin groups than in the BC group. This phenomenon might be related to hepatocyte apoptosis or fragmentation caused by icariin and p-icariin in the initial stage of DVH, and the inhibition of DHV-1 replication in vivo. The significant increases in serum ALP and LDH levels are consistent with severe hepatocyte injury in the VC group, but the decreases observed in the icariin and p-icariin groups were not clinically significant. At 54 h, the serum ALP and LDH levels were significantly greater in the VC group than in other three groups, which was indicatived of severe liver injury in the late stage of infection in the VC group. Serum ALP and LDH did not increase significantly before 8 h in any of the groups. These results imply that, in the early stage of infection, DHV-1 was still replicating and its proliferation was too low to cause extensive hepatocyte injury. These results are consistent with those of our previous study [31].",

            "text": "We found that indices of liver injury (ALT, ALP, and LDH) were positively correlated with markers of oxidative stress (MDA and iNOS) and negatively correlated with antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px, SOD, and catalase) (Table 3). In the late stage of infection, it seems that oxidative stress caused severe damage to hepatocytes and aggravated the severity of DVH in the VC group. Thus, the serum ALT, ALP, and LDH levels increased in the VC group. Icariin and p-icariin appeared to balance the free radical levels and significantly reduced the serum ALT, ALP, and LDH levels in ducklings exposed to DHV-1. These results illustrate the hepatoprotective effects of icariin and p-icariin are mediated by their antioxidative effects. The serum ALT, ALP, and LDH levels in the p-icariin group were lower than those in the icariin group, although the differences were not significant. These findings might also be related to the slightly higher survival rate in the p-icariin group than the icariin group. SOD was significantly and negatively correlated with ALT and LDH (p < 0.05), which suggests that SOD is one of the most important antioxidant markers in DVH. Notable, p-icariin had greater effects on SOD, ALT, and LDH than icariin, which is consistent with the greater survival rate in the p-icariin group (Table 1). In the first 8 h, the serum albumin level was significantly lower in the VC group than in the BC group, which was probably due to a reduction in the hepatocytes\u2019 ability to synthesize albumin following infection with DHV-1 (Table 2). Administration of icariin or p-icariin groups increased the albumin level compared with the VC group at 54 h after infection, but the levels in both groups were still lower than those in the BC group. These improvements in albumin levels might be related to the inhibitory effects of icariin and p-icariin against DHV-1. Both components may inhibit the replication of DHV-1, and ultimately inhibiting the protein synthesis of DHV-1 in hepatocytes. In the early stage of infection, there was no significant difference in serum globulin levels among the four groups while the TP levels followed a similar pattern to albumin levels (Table 2). In the later stage of infection, abundant free radicals probably caused serious liver injury in the VC group. Free radicals also affect proteins and we found positive correlations between markers of protein damage and oxidative stress in this paper (Table 3). Accordingly, the serum TP, albumin, and globulin levels in the VC group were significantly lower than those in the BC group. Globulin has some immunologic roles. Thus, the lower resistance to DHV-1 in the VC group may be related to a decrease in globulin levels, and potentially aggravated the severity of DVH. Icariin and p-icariin can scavenge free radicals, reducing the extent of hepatocyte damage. Therefore, the serum TP, albumin, and globulin levels of icariin and p-icariin groups declined modestly or remained about the same in these two groups. Serum MDA, GSH-Px, SOD, catalase, and iNOS levels are related to the abundance of free radicals while the serum ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, TP, albumin, and globulin levels are related to the severity of DVH. These correlations are particularly important because they highlight the critical role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of DVH (Table 3). The anti-DVH effects of icariin and p-icariin are probably related to their free radical scavenging properties. Although the free radical scavenging properties appear to be similar between icariin and p-icariin, p-icariin seemed to have slightly greater anti-DVH effects than icariin, although the differences were not statistically significant. Overall, these findings indicate that the clinical effects of icariin and p-icariin are not simply related to their antioxidant properties. Further studies are needed to investigate the other relevant mechanisms by which icariin and p-icariin protect against DVH.",
