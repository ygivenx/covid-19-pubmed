Pathogens bound by the receptor include viruses and fungi, which bear high mannose oligosaccharides, as well as parasites that are rich in the Lewisx epitope.

When the neck domain oligomerizes, the resulting cluster of histidine residues allows purification of the expressed polypeptides on immobilized nickel resin. Using this approach, the neck domain of each receptor has been shown to function as an oligomerization domain that can form tetramers in the absence of the flanking membrane anchor and CRD.11 The structure of the repeat units in the neck domain of DC\u2010SIGNR has been deduced from an unusual crystal form in which the unit cell comprises a single repeat unit in the context of a fragment containing seven repeat units.5 Each repeat unit consists of a short N\u2010terminal nonhelical region that includes a proline residue, followed by a coiled\u2010coil region. A heptad pattern of leucine, isoleucine and valine residues in the helical region mediates packing of the helices in a 4\u2010stranded coiled\u2010coil in the neck domain tetramer.",

In these experiments, the ability of the isolated neck domain to interact with the full extracellular portion of the receptor was investigated. If there were significant interactions between the CRDs that stabilize the tetramers, it would be expected that these additional interactions would favor formation of homo\u2010oligomers of the fragment representing the full extracellular portion of the receptor rather than mixed oligomers containing the neck domain fragments and the full extracellular fragment.",

Because the neck domain cannot bind to mannose\u2010Sepharose on its own, the results represent purification of mixed oligomers that contain both the neck domain and the full extracellular fragment (Fig. 2).

In previous studies, truncation of the neck domain of DC\u2010SIGNR to remove the non\u2010repeat region at the N\u2010terminus plus the partial repeat unit at this end resulted in no change in the stability of the neck domain, since the observed denaturation temperature measured by differential scanning calorimetry remained at 82\u00b0C.5, 11 Similar truncation of the neck domain of DC\u2010SIGN results in a 7\u2010repeat fragment that remains a tetramer at room temperature and the denaturation temperature of 56\u00b0C measured by calorimetry is very close to the value of 54\u00b0C for the full length neck domain previously reported (data not shown).11 Thus, for both DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR, the stability of the tetramers is largely a function of the 7 full repeat units at the C\u2010terminus of the neck domain.",

In all other copies of the repeat unit, this position is occupied by a valine residue, which is one of the residues that forms part of the heptad motif of hydrophobic residues characteristic of coiled\u2010coil structures. The valine side chain is able to pack into the coiled coil, while the phenylalanine side chain is too large to be accommodated.

Gel filtration revealed that this version of the neck domain forms a stable tetramer at room temperature since it elutes at the same position as a natural fragment of the neck domain of DC\u2010SIGNR containing seven repeat units, which has been characterized as a tetramer [Fig. 3(A)].5 Analysis by differential scanning calorimetry showed that the uniform neck domain is actually more stable than the equivalent portion of the natural DC\u2010SIGNR neck domain, with a thermal denaturation temperature of 94\u00b0C compared to 82\u00b0C for the natural neck domain [Fig. 3(B)]. One reason for the lower stability of the natural neck domain would be the presence of the potentially destabilizing C\u2010terminal repeat unit. In addition, the uniform neck domain contains an arginine residue at each position 15, while this residue is glutamine or glutamic acid in several of the repeat units in the natural neck domain. In the crystal structure of the neck domain, the arginine residue is on the outer surface of the bundle of helices and forms a salt bridge with a conserved glutamic acid side chain at position 12 in the same polypeptide [Fig. 1(E)]. Such an i,i + 3 salt bridge hydrogen bond would contribute to stability of the repeat units.15, 16 Together, these results define a prototype sequence of a neck repeat unit with very high stability, in which leucine is present at position 6, packed on the inside of the coiled coil and arginine is present at position 15 making a salt bridge on the outside of bundle of helices.",

However, when the number of repeat units drops below 4, there is a change in the ratio of the signals at 208 and 222 nm. Values of this ratio higher than 1 are associated with small differences in the helical pitch resulting from packing in coiled\u2010coil structures.17 The expected changes are best characterized for parallel 2\u2010 and 3\u2010stranded coiled\u2010coils, but formation of the parallel 4\u2010helical bundle would be expected to have a similar effect. The slight decrease in the intensity of the CD signal per repeat unit for the neck domain with four repeat units is consistent with the gel filtration results showing that coiled\u2010coil tetramer is in equilibrium with a monomeric structure at the concentration used for gel filtration and CD analysis. The higher molar concentrations of the smaller fragments required to obtain good quality spectra would favor tetramer formation, so the results probably slightly under\u2010estimate the effect of partial dissociation for the fragment with 4 repeat units. In contrast, the fragment with only three repeat units shows a more significant loss of helical structure and a reduced ratio of the signals at 208 and 222 nm, which is consistent with the conclusion that this fragment does not form stable tetramers containing coiled coils. Taken together, these results indicate that a fully stable coiled\u2010coil structure requires the presence of at least five repeat units.",

Some of the distinct structural features conserved in the DC\u2010SIGNR genes are the presence of the stabilizing leucine residue at position 6 of all but the first and last repeat units and the presence of the unusual phenylalanine residue at position 6 in the repeat unit adjacent to the CRD, although there is variation in the number of repeat units. In contrast, the DC\u2010SIGN sequences show greater diversity, although the more stable repeat units, with the leucine at position 6 and arginine at position 15, are generally found nearer to the membrane, while repeat units at the C\u2010terminal end, towards the CRD, mostly contain glutamine at position 6. The destabilizing methionine residue is present at position 6 in only one or two repeat units in the middle of the neck domain. Conservation of these patterns, in spite of variation in the number of repeat units and the specific sequences, suggests that these features are selected because they confer different functional properties in the two receptors.",

The summary of the sequences of DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR molecules shown in Figure 6 reveals that relatively few repeat units are stabilized by the presence of both a leucine residue at position 6 and an arginine residue at position 15, but a high proportion of the repeat units contain one or the other of these residues.

The circular dichroism results confirm that the presence of glutamine is compatible with the coiled coil structure, with the decreased signal reflecting the loss of stability so that the tetramer is dissociated more of the time. It may be significant that the glutamine residue at position 6 would be the first residue of the coiled coil, following the disruption caused by the preceding proline and charged residues. The loss of hydrophobic interactions may be of greater significance in this context, leading to destabilization. In contrast, the presence of a methionine residue at position leads to more significant disruption of the structure of the neck domain, which may be explained based on steric constraints resulting from the longer, linear side chain that would not readily pack inside the coiled coil. Loss of stability and the potential disruption to the helical structure resulting from the presence of a methionine residue in the middle repeat unit probably explains why the neck domain of DC\u2010SIGN is resistant to crystallization.",

The presence of a phenylalanine residue at position 20 in the repeat unit adjacent to the CRD appears to cause a flaring apart of the CRDs, but the remainder of the neck domain is a stable tetrameric coiled coil. This arrangement of very stable repeat units in the neck domain, which is conserved in all of the DC\u2010SIGNR proteins in the primates, may be necessary to ensure that the neck domain remains tetrameric even though the final repeat units are splayed apart by the presence of the phenylalanine residue. The studies reported here suggest that the presence of stabilizing residues at positions 6 and 15 of the repeat units allows for the formation of stable tetramers even for shorter versions of the neck domain present in some individuals, which result from common genetic polymorphisms in the human population.21, 22 However, the results also define a minimal length for the neck domain to be fully stable, even in the presence of stabilizing residues within the repeat units. The very stable structure of the coiled coil ensures that the spacing between the CRDs in DC\u2010SIGNR is relatively fixed, although the exact orientation of the CRDs would be potentially flexible because of the flaring apart caused by the unusual repeat unit adjacent to the CRD.",
