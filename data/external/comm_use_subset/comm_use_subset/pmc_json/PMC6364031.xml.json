            "text": "An essential function of the gut mucosal epithelium is to act as a barrier between the luminal contents and underlying tissue that allows the transport of nutrients, water, and electrolytes but restricts the passage of potentially harmful luminal products and pathogens (1). This barrier is maintained by cell-cell contacts formed by apical-junctional complexes comprising tight junctions (TJs), adherent junctions, and desmosomes (1). TJs, found in epithelial and endothelial cells, are highly specialized intercellular adhesion complexes that contribute to the paracellular barrier (2\u20134). Numerous studies have unearthed multiple integral membrane proteins located at TJs, including occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), tricellulin, and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) proteins, as well as their membrane-associated scaffold proteins, such as zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), ZO-2, and ZO-3 (2\u20134). Disruption of TJs results in a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and an increase in paracellular permeability (5) and is associated with various diseases, including cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasogenic edema (2, 6, 7). Although TJs prevent pathogens from crossing the epithelial barrier, they are often targeted by pathogenic viruses and bacteria, leading to infection and the development of disease (7\u20139). Numerous viruses have developed different mechanisms to subvert host TJ barrier function for their own benefit, such as direct reorganization or degradation of specific TJ proteins, reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton, and activation of host cell signaling events (4, 7). Moreover, some viruses have been found to hijack TJ proteins as receptors for entry and infection (4, 7, 8). For example, rotavirus disrupts TJs and uses the TJ protein JAM-A as a coreceptor (5, 10). The amino-terminal domain of JAM-A also serves as a receptor for prototype and field isolate strains of mammalian reovirus (11, 12). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interacts with the N-terminal third of extracellular loop 1 in claudin-1, using it as a coreceptor after binding and interaction with the coreceptor CD81 (13, 14). Coxsackievirus and adenovirus use the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor protein for their internalization (15, 16). In addition, some viruses do not recognize TJ proteins as entry receptors but instead use them as entry factors to facilitate their entry and infection (10, 17, 18).",

            "text": "Viruses in the family Caliciviridae are small, nonenveloped, and icosahedral, and they carry single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA (19). The family has five well-established genera: Norovirus, Sapovirus, Nebovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus (19, 20). Recently, six new genera, tentatively named Recovirus (21), Valovirus (22), Bavovirus (23, 24), Nacovirus (24\u201326), Salovirus (27), and Sanovirus (28), have been added as unclassified caliciviruses. The most notable genera in the family are Norovirus and Sapovirus, which cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals, with noroviruses alone causing \u223c200,000 deaths per annum in children <5 years of age (29, 30). Despite their socioeconomic impact, our understanding of the life cycles of these viruses and the development of effective interventions against them have been hampered by a lack of efficient cell culture systems, particularly for those caliciviruses that infect humans (31\u201333). The Cowden strain of porcine sapovirus (PSaV) is the only strain in the genus Sapovirus that replicates in a porcine kidney cell line in the presence of porcine intestinal contents or bile acids, specifically, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) (33, 34). Therefore, PSaV strain Cowden is an attractive model for the study of Sapovirus and Norovirus life cycles and for use in developing vaccine or therapeutic interventions against human and animal sapoviruses.",

Recent reports have indicated that, in addition to the use of glycans as attachment factors (38, 39), murine noroviruses (MNoVs) utilize proteinaceous cellular receptors, CD300lf and/or CD300ld (40, 41).

However, little is known about the roles of TJ proteins in PSaV entry and infection. This prompted us to investigate the potential roles of TJs and their molecules in PSaV entry and infection. In the present study, we found that PSaV strain Cowden dissociates TJs, as indicated by decreased TER and increased paracellular permeability in the porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK. PSaV was observed to directly bind to occludin and then to become internalized as a complex into cells. In addition, these PSaV-occludin complexes were found to travel from early to late endosomes, mediated by small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7. Our findings indicate that PSaV exploits occludin in epithelial cells to enter and initiate virus replication.",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that some enteric viruses, such as rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), can hijack TJs and their proteins for efficient entry and infection (4, 7, 8, 10, 17, 45, 46). Since TJs are located at the basolateral surfaces of cells and their proteins seal cell-cell adhesion (47), these viruses must dissociate TJs prior to their entry through the basolateral surface of a cell. This in turn results in decreased TER and increased paracellular permeability (5). Therefore, we first examined whether PSaV infection induces a decrease in TER in LLC-PK cells grown on transwell filters. As shown in Fig. 1A, a rapid decrease in TER was observed at 5 min postinfection (p.i.) with PSaV in LLC-PK monolayers without GCDCA supplementation. Supplementation with GCDCA further decreased TER in both virus-inoculated and mock-inoculated cells (Fig. 1A). We further examined whether purified PSaV virus-like particles (VLPs) alone can also open tight junctions. Addition of 4 \u03bcg/ml of PSaV VLPs significantly reduced the TER in a manner similar to that of the purified PSaV particles (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that PSaV can dissociate the lateral surfaces of LLC-PK cells early in infection and that addition of bile acids enhances the disruption of TJs.",

Because PSaV induced dissociation of TJs very early in infection, we next examined whether PSaV infection affected the passage of two nonionic tracers (4-kDa and 70-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextrans) in cells grown on transwell filters (Fig. 1B). LLC-PK monolayers treated without any chemical (the mock-treated group) showed minimal diffusion of these tracers across the monolayers, confirming intact TJs (Fig. 1B). As a positive control, treatment of LLC-PK cells with the calcium ion chelating agent EGTA, known to open TJs and generate epithelial depolarization (5, 49, 50), induced a 25-fold increase in 4-kDa FITC-dextran paracellular diffusion and a 15-fold increase in 70-kDa FITC-dextran paracellular diffusion compared to mock-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Incubation of PSaV in cell culture for 30 min without GCDCA supplementation produced a 22-fold increase in the diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and a 12-fold increase in the diffusion of 70-kDa FITC-dextran (Fig. 1B). Inoculation of PSaV together with 200 \u03bcM GCDCA increased diffusion by 24- and 14-fold for 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B). In addition, treatment of LLC-PK cell monolayers with GCDCA alone induced 6-fold and 2-fold increases in paracellular diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B). Binding of PSaV VLPs showed a pattern similar to that of PSaV particles, leading to 20-fold and 10-fold increases in the diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran, respectively (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that PSaV infection induced dissociation of TJs, leading to an increase in paracellular permeability.",

The z-section presented in Fig. 1C shows that the lipid was confined in the apical domains of control cells and that no lateral staining was detected. However, incubation of cells with purified PSaV particles or VLPs for 1 h or control EGTA for 10 min resulted in the diffusion of the Bodify FL-C12-sphingomyelin\u2013BSA complex across TJs and stained the lateral membranes (Fig. 1C). We also checked the distribution of the basolateral membrane marker Na+K+-ATPase after incubation with PSaV particles or VLPs. Mock-infected cells without any treatment showed clear basolateral distribution of Na+K+-ATPase (Fig. 1C). However, inoculation of LLC-PK with purified PSaV particles or VLPs or treatment with EGTA resulted in translocation of Na+K+-ATPase to the apical surface (Fig. 1C). These results further confirm that PSaV infection disrupts the TJs of cells.",

Therefore, we explored the cellular distribution of TJ-associated proteins following PSaV infection. Confocal microscopy (CM) observation showed the sharp ring-like structures of the three transmembrane proteins occludin, claudin-1, and JAM-1, as well as their submembranous scaffolding protein, ZO-1, in control monolayers (Fig. 2A). However, among these proteins, intracytoplasmic translocation of occludin was more pronounced than that of claudin-1, JAM-1, or ZO-1 at early time points (30 and 60 min p.i. with PSaV) (Fig. 2A and B). This result was confirmed by localization of occludin during PSaV infection using z-stacking CM. Pronounced accumulation of occludin in the cytoplasm was evident, whereas ZO-1 remained in the paracellular junction area during early PSaV infection (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that PSaV infection promotes the internalization of occludin, which was more conspicuous than that of the other TJ-associated proteins investigated.",

The antibody specific for occludin significantly precipitated PSaV in comparison to precipitation by the antibodies specific to the other TJ molecules tested (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this result, antibody against PSaV capsid protein significantly precipitated occludin, but not claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 (Fig. 4C). To confirm the direct interaction between PSaV and occludin, we performed a pulldown assay using free glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged occludin and purified PSaV particles or PSaV VLPs. As shown in Fig. 4D, PSaV particles and VLPs were precipitated by GST-tagged occludin. The results of the colocalization experiment and the observed direct interaction between PSaV and occludin suggest that PSaV strain Cowden uses occludin as a coreceptor.",

Cells were transfected with pooled small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting four individual sites in each gene, helping to reduce off-target effects. Subsequent protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis and CM. Expression of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 was significantly reduced at 48 h posttransfection (hpt) compared to protein expression at 24 hpt (Fig. 6A). This was further confirmed by CM (Fig. 6B). We next investigated the knockdown effects of these TJ proteins on PSaV entry. As expected, silencing of occludin expression significantly inhibited the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into the cells, whereas transfection with scrambled siRNA (siScram) allowed the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C). Unexpectedly, knockdown of claudin-1 had a moderate inhibitory effect on PSaV entry into cells (Fig. 6C). In addition, siRNA knockdown of JAM-1 or ZO-1 had no effect on PSaV entry (Fig. 6C). To assess whether off-target effects of siRNAs contributed to the results described above in occludin-silenced cells, we constructed a plasmid (GFP-WT-OCC) containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type occludin gene and two mutant plasmids (GFP-M1-OCC and GFP-M2-OCC) containing four silent-mutation sites corresponding to the four pooled siRNAs. The occludin-siRNA target sequences and mutation sites are shown in Fig. 7A. Cells harboring GFP-WT-OCC were sensitive to transfection with the pooled siRNAs targeting occludin (Fig. 7B and C), while cells harboring GFP-M1-OCC or GFP-M2-OCC were insensitive to transfection with the pooled siRNAs (Fig. 7B and C).

A significant reduction in PSaV genome replication, PSaV VPg protein synthesis, and PSaV titers was observed in occludin knockdown cells from 6 h p.i. until 36 h p.i. (Fig. 8). Moreover, knockdown of claudin-1 also significantly decreased PSaV genome copy numbers, PSaV VPg protein synthesis, and PSaV titers (Fig. 8). However, silencing of JAM-1 and ZO-1 had no inhibitory effects on PSaV genome replication, PSaV VPg protein synthesis, or PSaV titers (Fig. 8). We further examined the effects of silencing of occludin and claudin-1 together on PSaV VPg protein synthesis and PSaV titers. Transfection of combined siRNAs against occludin and claudin-1 led to the downregulation of their target proteins, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 9A). As expected, when siRNAs for occludin and claudin-1 were combined, a significant decrease in PSaV genome copy numbers, titers, and VPg protein synthesis were observed (Fig. 9B to D). Taken together, our results indicate that PSaV utilizes occludin as a coreceptor and that claudin-1 may serve as an entry factor.",

CHO cells transfected with pmRFP-OCC expressed occludin, whereas CHO cells transfected with a control plasmid, pCDNA3.1, did not (Fig. 10A). CHO cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 or pmRFP-OCC were infected with PSaV particles at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 in the presence of 200 \u03bcM GCDCA and harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. The samples were subjected to Western blotting, qPCR, and CM analyses. The CHO cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 did not allow virus replication (Fig. 10B to D). However, PSaV replication was evident in pmRFP-OCC-transfected CHO cells at 24 h p.i. but was markedly decreased by 48 h p.i. (Fig. 10B). The viral protein VPg and the genome were detected at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 10B and C) but were significantly decreased by 48 h p.i. (Fig. 10B and C). Compared with LLC-PK cells infected with PSaV, VPg expression and genome copy numbers were very low in pmRFP-OCC-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 10B and C). This may have been due to missing factors needed to sustain PSaV replication. These results suggest that ectopic expression of occludin in nonpermissive cells renders them susceptible to PSaV replication.",

Rab5 is a key regulator controlling the internalization of vesicles and fusion with early endosomes (52), whereas Rab7 is primarily associated with late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion (53). These characteristics can be used to differentiate between endosomal compartments: early endosomes contain Rab5 and its effector, EEA1, whereas late endosomes contain Rab7 and its effector, LAMP2 (54). PSaV strain Cowden is known to travel from early to late endosomes prior to PSaV uncoating and genome release into the cytoplasm (55, 56). Therefore, we examined trafficking of PSaV from early to late endosomes prior to determining whether PSaV and occludin travel in a complex to these endosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports (55, 56), most AF594-labeled PSaV particles colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA1 at 30 min p.i. and with the late endosome marker LAMP2 at 60 min p.i. (Fig. 11A and 12A), confirming the journey of PSaV from early to late endosomes (55, 56).",

            "text": "The initial event in the virus life cycle is binding of the virus particles to specific cell surface receptors, enabling their entry into cells and the initiation of pathology (4, 35). Therefore, interactions between viruses and host cell receptors are a crucial step affecting viral tropism, pathogenesis, and host range (35, 57). Accumulating evidence indicates that viruses enter cells through a complex multistep process in which many viruses, such as rotavirus and HCV, require more than one receptor for virus entry and infection (45, 58, 59). Members of at least nine different virus families have been reported to use TJ proteins as receptors (4, 45). Although cell surface carbohydrate moieties, either terminal SAs or HBGAs, are used by some caliciviruses as attachment factors (36, 37), cell surface proteins are also utilized as receptors by MNoV, FCV, and Hom-1 vesivirus, with the last two viruses recognizing a TJ protein, JAM-1, as a receptor (40\u201342, 44, 60). The usage of \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SAs on O-linked glycoproteins as attachment factors for PSaV entry and infection was previously described (36). In the present study, we found that PSaV and occludin interact directly and enter cells as a complex, as demonstrated by treatment of cells with specific siRNAs or MAbs. These data indicate that, similar to FCV and Hom-1 vesivirus, PSaV utilizes a TJ protein, occludin, as a coreceptor (44, 60). Given the previous results (36), we conclude that PSaV first attaches to SAs on the apical cell surface, dissociates TJs, moves into the TJs, and then binds to occludin for successful entry and infection.",

Therefore, viruses utilizing apical-junctional complex molecules as receptors have devised specific strategies to disrupt the apical-junctional complex as a part of their cellular pathogenesis, resulting in successful entry and later clinical consequences, such as diarrhea in the case of sapovirus infections (4, 5, 8, 18). In this context, we hypothesized that PSaVs disrupt and then open TJs prior to attachment to occludin. In the present study, we showed that early infection of PSaV induced decreased TER in conjunction with increased paracellular permeability. Moreover, alterations in the TJ fence function in response to PSaV infection were observed, as shown by lateral diffusion of the lipid probe, Bodify FL-C12-sphingomyelin\u2013BSA complex, administered apically. The rotavirus surface protein VP8* modulates the gate and fence functions of TJs in epithelial cells, and the VP4 surface protein of some rotavirus strains defines the requirement for JAM-A as a basolateral coreceptor (5, 10). Similar to the mechanism of basolateral entry by rotaviruses, we have shown that PSaV can dissociate TJs, exposing occludin, which is sequestered in the apical-junctional complexes at the lateral surfaces of cells. PSaV then hijacks occludin as a coreceptor for entry and infection. In addition, a relatively large proportion of intracellular occludin did not colocalize with PSaV particles. Although the reason for this is not known, binding of PSaV particles to attachment receptors may activate signaling pathways that facilitate internalization of virus-free occludin into the cytoplasm. Further studies are required to examine whether PSaV induces activation of such a signaling pathway(s).",

Moreover, direct interaction between these proteins and PSaV was not evident by immunoprecipitation assay. However, transfection of siRNA targeting claudin-1 partially blocked PSaV entry, as well as significantly reducing viral genome copy numbers, protein synthesis, and titers. Similar findings have been observed in studies of the entry processes of some viruses, including rotavirus, PED coronavirus, and coxsackie B virus. In these studies, TJ proteins, such as claudin-1, were found to serve as scaffolds that recruit and anchor signaling or regulatory molecules to the vicinity of virus entry (10, 17, 18). Taken together, our results suggest that claudin-1 serves as a scaffold at the site of PSaV entry. The functional roles of other claudins as potential entry receptors or entry factors for PSaV warrant further research.",

However, the replicative cycle of PSaV was not sustained in occludin-expressing CHO cells. This may be due to insufficient host cell machinery required for viral protein and RNA synthesis, as well as virion assembly. This finding was in contrast to results described for Hom-1 calicivirus, where transfection of human JAM-1 (hJAM-1) in CHO cells enabled successful replication of virus (44).

Bile acids are critical for PSaV genome escape from late endosomes into the cell cytoplasm to start viral replication (55). Interestingly, in the present study, the addition of the bile acid GCDCA decreased TER and increased paracellular permeability in LLC-PK cells, thereby aiding in the dissociation of TJs. This suggests that, in addition to aiding PSaV escape from late endosomes, bile acids can facilitate early interactions between PSaV and occludin through the dissociation of TJs. Bile acids have previously been reported to modulate intestinal permeability by autophosphorylation of the epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor and dephosphorylation and rearrangement of occludin at TJs (63). Moreover, the role of bile acids in opening TJs is known to be mediated by src family kinases and is ameliorated by EGF treatment (63). A correlation between the presence of bile acid and TJ modification upon PSaV entry has not been fully investigated. Therefore, further studies are required to elucidate this particular function of bile acid during PSaV entry.",

            "text": "Upon internalization, most viruses travel to different endosomal compartments for subsequent uncoating and cytoplasmic invasion (54). Of the various small GTPases present on endosomes, Rab5 and Rab7 are critical for the function of early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively (64, 65). Consistent with the results of previous studies (55, 56), we found that PSaV particles progressed from EEA1-positive early endosomes to LAMP2-positive late endosomes very early in infection and that this trafficking was decreased by siRNAs specific for the early endosome marker Rab5 or the late endosome marker Rab7. Interestingly, inhibition of Rab5 or Rab7 by transfection of siRNAs diminished the coentry of PSaV and occludin into the cytoplasm. These results were confirmed by transfection of plasmids expressing dominant-negative mutants of Rab5 (S34N) or Rab7 (T22N), which also inhibited trafficking of PSaV particles in complex with occludin from early to late endosomes. The direct interaction between PSaV and occludin, as well as entry of PSaV and occludin as complexes into the cytoplasm, suggested that these complexes travel from early to late endosomes. This result was similar to those of previous studies, which showed that, regardless of the usage of TJ proteins as receptors, TJ proteins internalized into cells during virus entry, or during constitutive trafficking, could be transported to their endosomal compartments (18, 50, 66).",
