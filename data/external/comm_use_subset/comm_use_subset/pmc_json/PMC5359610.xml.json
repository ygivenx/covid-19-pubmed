The results showed that the optimal multiplex RT-LAMP reaction was obtained with primer sequences shown in Table 1 and the primer concentrations described in Materials and Methods. At 63 \u00b0C, the best amplification efficiency was observed for all the three HA subtypes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1), and thus 63 \u00b0C was considered to be optimal temperature for the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction (data not shown). According to the amplification curves obtained by real-time turbidimeter, 50 min was selected as the optimal incubation time. In mRT-LAMP-IRNH, the multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes. A schematic of the principles of cascade invasive reaction and gold nanoparticle hybridization is shown in Fig. 1. In the positive reaction, the cleaved hairpin probe cannot trigger the aggregation of AuNPs, leading to a red color of the reaction. Conversely, in the negative reaction, the intact hairpin probe leads to the aggregation of AuNPs, and then the reaction mixture becomes colorless (Fig. 1).",

The main drawbacks of virus culture are that it can only detect live viruses and requires more time and higher biosecurity. Immunological methods for testing influenza viruses have low skill requirements, but poor sensitivity and specificity. Recently, many molecular diagnostic approaches such as single or multiplex RT-PCR (including real-time RT-PCR) have been developed for subtyping influenza viruses. However, these methods require expensive thermal cycling equipments. Currently, rapid, reliable and affordable point-of-care tests for influenza virus detection are urgently needed, especially in resource limited regions. In this study, we describe a sensitive mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay for the detection of three influenza A viruses (subtypes A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) for the first time. The read-out can be observed by naked eyes, and no specialized instrument is required, which make this assay especially useful in resource-limited situations such as primary care facilities.",

            "text": "As LAMP belongs to isothermal amplification methods, it can be carried out with a simple water bath and without the need of bulky and expensive equipments, which points to the potential applicability of the assay for clinical point-of-care diagnostic use. LAMP products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, turbidity or fluorescence detection3536, lateral flow dipstick23, or even visual inspection3738. These methods are robust and reliable, but detect total amplification products in a reaction and are thus limited to detection of a single target. Multiplex detection is the development trend of pathogen detection technology due to the properties of cost savings and high efficiency. In order to achieve multiplex LAMP detection, methods based on end point analysis2425 as well as real-time detection262728 have been employed to differentiate multiple target sequences, while these strategies all required complicated and specialized instruments. To enable multiplex pathogen detection without the need of specialized instruments, Dou et al. developed a polymer/paper hybrid microfluidic biochip for simultaneous LAMP detection of three meningitis-causing pathogens. Though this assay was not really a multiplex LAMP reaction, by using of microfluidic biochip, three pathogens were simultaneously detected on a chip, and high sensitivity and specificity were achieved within 1 h39. In this study, we present an alternative molecular method for multiplex LAMP amplicon detection by combining invader techniques3233 and gold nanoparticle probe techniques293031. AuNPs have been used as a sensor for DNA detection for years. To improve the sensitivity, we coupled invader techniques with gold nanoparticle probe techniques, which were further used to detect multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons for the first time. Although the identification of the multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons is monoplex, the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay developed in this study is a cost-saving method that requires no complicated instrument, and is more suitable for multiple-target detection of limited amount and/or precious nucleic acids. This pilot study also provides a strategy for establishing multiplex LAMP assay much more than three plex for field use. Meanwhile, unknown clinical specimens with co-infection can also be distinguished without using any equipments.",

Moreover, the invasive reaction was a specific DNA detection method by the use of two target-specific probes. The mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay combines the specificities of both LAMP and the cascade invasive reaction, which should provide higher specificity in theory. In this study, we demonstrated the high specificity of the assay by showing the absence of cross-reactivity by analyzing the RNA extracts from various genetically or clinically related viruses which could cause similar symptoms.",

LAMP reaction was able to tolerate the inhibitory effect of large amounts of templates, and was less affected by the presence of various salts and inhibitors42. In mRT-LAMP-IRNH method, aggregation of AuNPs is achieved by adding hairpin probes complementary to both AuNPs. The cleavage of hairpin probes is triggered by the cleaved flaps from the target-specific primary invasive reaction. Because one LAMP amplicon can yield large numbers of cleaved hairpin probes, the sensitivity of this method is increased significantly. By testing ten-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA transcripts, the analytical sensitivities of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay were found to be 101 copies of synthetic RNA for all three targets. Previous studies have shown that although multiplex nucleic acid detection tests have the advantage of high efficiency, due to the mutual interference of multiple primers, the analytic sensitivities of these assays tend to decrease. However, through the signal amplification effects of invader techniques and gold nanoparticle probe techniques, the sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay established in this study was equivalent or even significantly increased as compared to general monoplex LAMP method23434445. In this study, the detection limit for A/H5 obtained by mRT-LAMP-IRNH was ten times higher than that obtained by real-time turbidity detection, indicating the cascade invasive reaction coupled with AuNPs hybridization increased the sensitivity of LAMP whose results were usually analyzed through turbidity.",

As 120 min might be a little long for field use, we had tried to shorten the invasive reaction and hybridization reaction time, but we found that when the concentration of virus was low, the result might be somewhat ambiguous to the naked eye if the detection time was shortened. In future, we would test more conditions and settings to try to shorten the reaction time, and to combine invasive reaction with hybridization reaction in one step.
