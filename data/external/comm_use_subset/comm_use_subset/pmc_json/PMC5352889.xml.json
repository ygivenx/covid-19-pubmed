AECOPD was defined with at least two major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, enhanced cough, or increased sputum production) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore throat, and cough) for at least 2 consecutive days [13, 14]. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, renal failure, cancer, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, asthma, antivirus treatment, or currently active tuberculosis were excluded. In addition, COPD patients who were unconscious or declined to participate were also excluded. Meanwhile 12 healthy, never-smoking, nonatopic, similar-aged volunteers with no history of respiratory disease underwent sputum induction and lung function assessment. All of them accepted routine check-ups and showed no clinical symptoms of inflammatory diseases. Induced sputum and serum were collected and the following basic clinical characteristics were recorded and assessed: age, gender, smoking history, and lung function (GOLD levels). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to the recruitment and this study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Jilin Provincial People's Hospital (approval number: 201405).",

Moreover, population with low influenza vaccine coverage had higher influenza detection rates, and none of the influenza-positive patients received vaccination in the previous year [20]. Considering the extremely low influenza vaccination coverage (1.9% of the total population) in China and the factor that influenza-positive rate is higher in adults and elderly [21], attention should be paid to the rapidly aging country to effectively control influenza A infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm the exact reasons for the variance in viral distribution and viral detection rates between our findings and other studies.",

            "text": "The profiling of 40 inflammatory markers was conducted to assess the association between viral infection and host cytokine responses in AECOPD. In previous studies the major objective of detection was to investigate the types of microorganisms involved in AECOPD, and less emphasis was placed on proinflammatory cytokines. We found that patients with viral infections showed higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 than those without (Figure 3). Patients with a coinfection by virus + bacteria also exhibited higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 than those with negative microbiology results. Furthermore, the expression of these markers showed no difference between VN and HC (p > 0.05), indicating that the difference of marker expression might be caused by viral infection. IL-6 is a pleiotropic acute-phase cytokine involved in the host immune response to infection, reflecting the severity of lower airway inflammation [27, 28]. Higher levels of IL-6 are associated with the exacerbations of COPD and increase the predictive accuracy of viral infection when combined with the clinical diagnosis [26, 29]. TNF-\u03b1 is a mononuclear-phagocyte-origin cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on innate host responses to microbes [30] and it recruits inflammatory cells into the site of infection [31] and is overexpressed in AECOPD [32]. MCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant that contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the site of infection [33, 34]. Higher levels of MCP-1 have been reported in patients with virus-induced respiratory illness [35, 36]. There is increasing evidence that macrophages orchestrate the inflammatory responses of COPD through the release of chemoattractant and proteases [37]. Higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-\u03b1 may be associated with the activation of macrophages. Influenza virus, which was the most common virus in our study, induces the activation of macrophages via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [38]. Yageta et al. [39] found that isolated murine macrophages were activated by costimulation of cigarette smoke extract and influenza A virus. In response to influenza A virus-infection, macrophages produce large amount of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 [40\u201343]. Tissue macrophages are the key cell types responsible for the production of antiviral and immunoreactive cytokines [44]. Taken together, we conclude that higher levels of those inflammatory markers might be induced by viral inflammation and activation of macrophages, which might provide support for further investigation in the pathogenesis of viral AECOPD in Asia.",

Viral AECOPD is associated with a systemic immune response that involves IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1, suggesting a prominent role for macrophage activation in AECOPD. Future work can define the clinical and treatment implications of these result, and lay the basis for further investigating the role of immune system in the pathogenesis and development of AECOPD.",
