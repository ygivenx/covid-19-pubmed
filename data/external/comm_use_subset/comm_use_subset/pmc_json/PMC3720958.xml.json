Cryptococcus is responsible for approximately one-third of all AIDS related deaths and a more prevalent cause of HIV-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa than tuberculosis [1]. In other developing countries infections as a result of Cryptococcus are second only to tuberculosis and frequently co-occur together [1]. The development of new antifungals, highly active antiviral treatment (HAART), and combination therapy regimens has increased long-term survival rates, but infections remain difficult to treat and frequently reoccur. Cryptococcus is now increasingly associated with a rising number of infections in seemingly healthy humans and animals worldwide [2]\u2013[9].",

C. neoformans var. grubii is the most prevalent clinical isolate worldwide. However, C. neoformans var. neoformans is more prevalent in some regions, such as Europe. C. gattii is the most prevalent cause of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent hosts. However, in some regions of the world, C. gattii is now increasingly identified as the cause of infections in immunocompromised hosts [10]\u2013[17]. Most cryptococcal infections result from the inhalation of infectious particles (yeast cells or spores) from the environment. Development of overt disease can be the result of acute, latent, or chronic infections. In nature C. neoformans var. neoformans is most frequently isolated from avian habitats and guano, and C. gattii is most frequently isolated from trees and soil. C. neoformans var. grubii, the most prevalent worldwide, has been frequently associated with avian habitats, and also trees and soil. Frequent isolation of Cryptococcus from plants and mating in association with plants, trees, soil, and avian guano suggest the importance of the environmental niche for both the development of infectious propagules (i.e. spores) and the maintenance of infectious reservoirs [18]\u2013[24]. Cryptococcus is a prominent environmental organism, and humans are frequently exposed to its airborne infectious propagules through inhalation [25], [26]. How the environmental growth conditions and airborne infectious route influences risk and development of disease is presently unknown.",

Due to the small size of spores, it is presumed that spores are more effectively aerosolized in nature and thus more efficiently enter the bronchial tubes and alveolar spaces within the lungs [27], [29]. Additionally, spores are implicated in promoting infection because, in contrast to yeast cells, they do not require opsonization for phagocytosis by macrophages [29]. Macrophages play pivotal roles in the early host defense against Cryptococcus\n[30]. Ongoing outbreaks of C. gattii in the United States and Canada have renewed interest to better understand the acquisition and development of cryptococcosis.",

Although both methodologies cause morbidity and mortality, neither truly mimics the inhalation of infectious particles because these methodologies require yeast and/or spores to be administered within a suspension. The inoculation route, high dosages of cells utilized, and initial fluid solution could alter initial immune response and downstream sequela [34]\u2013[38]. Appropriate control of cryptococcal infections depends on an intact immune system including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, and the appropriate production and activity of cytokines [39]\u2013[45]. Mounting evidence suggests that there are significant differences in risk to infection, development of disease, progression and host survival between the different Cryptococcus species [30], [37], [38], [46]\u2013[48]. Current murine models are most frequently used but fall short of replicating the actual aerosol route of infection and may hinder our ability to decipher initial events that lead to the clearance or establishment of latent or progressive infection. Therefore these models may not accurately reflect the virulence properties of spores versus yeast, mating type a versus \u03b1 strains, or the differences between molecular types or species [33], [49]\u2013[53].",

Historic applications of this approach include crude exposure from soil inoculated with Cryptococcus, utilization of a jet nebulizer, and infection in a Henderson Chamber [50], [54], [57]. Information extracted from the soil seeding infection was limited because infection rates and development of disease were variable, mice were exposed for multiple days, and the dosages of cells the mice were exposed to versus the dose initially retained in the lungs were not delineated. Infection initiated through the Henderson Chamber resulted in more consistent infection rates and development of disease in comparison to crude soil exposure [50]. Only 20% of mice exposed to aerosolized Cryptococcus basidiospores via a jet nebulizer succumbed to infection [53]. Variable infection rates and disease development were likely due to differences in the inoculum used, method of aerosolization, duration of exposure, host genotype, and strain of Cryptococcus utilized. These early studies were successful at initiating infection, but computer-controlled facilities were not available, Cryptococcus species were not yet taxonomically differentiated, and mating and the production of spores versus yeast had not been fully appreciated [50], [58].",

            "text": "The Madison Aerosol Chamber (College of Engineering Shop, University of Wisconsin) is now the standard apparatus for aerosol exposure of primary pathogens designated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Significant technological advancements now allow computer-controlled devices within the Madison Chamber to obtain samples pre- and post-nebulization from the exposure chamber (BioSampler), to adjust and monitor relative humidity within the chamber, and to collect pertinent data on mass and size of aerosolized cells exposed to mice [59]. These data can determine the effects of temperature, relative humidity, and the nebulization process on cells. In addition, we can calculate the dose that the mice were exposed to during a given time period, which facilitates the establishment of defined aerobiology exposure parameters for a given pathogen [59]. This study is the first contemporary application of the Madison Chamber to establish a well validated aerosol model of murine infection of Cryptococcus. We define the preparation of inoculum, concentration of inoculum, particle size distributions consistent with efficient aerosolization, and defined aerobiology exposure parameters for the effective and consistent delivery of aerosolized Cryptococcus cells to mice. A well validated inhalation model has considerable potential to facilitate novel insights into the primary exposure route of Cryptococcus in humans, time course of disease development, environmental conditions enhancing risk to acquisition, the role of spores and/or yeast in the infection process, and virulence of divergent mating types and genotypes which could lead to novel preventative strategies or therapeutic modalities.",

For preliminary aerosolization tests we varied growth condition(s), exposure time, and humidity to increase the viable number of cells that mice would be exposed to within the whole-body exposure apparatus (dose presented) as determined from the viable BioSampler densities. We aimed to obtain a calculated dose presented of greater than 100 cells/mouse to maximize dose delivered and retention within the lungs. In various trials, cells were (1) grown in yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and prepared directly from the liquid preparation; (2) grown in YPD and subjected to natural evaporation and drying to mimic desiccation in nature, before being resuspended in water for nebulization; or (3) subcultured in YPD broth and then inoculated on agar for growth, mating, and the production of dry yeast and/or spores. Although cells were initially grown by different methods all Cryptococcus strains were collected and 20 mL of 1\u00d7108 cell/mL suspension were used as standard inoculum density for each aerobiology exposure. To confirm the density of each cell preparation prior to nebulization (Pre-nebulization, CFU/mL) in the Madison Chamber 500 \u00b5L aliquots from every final preparation were taken and diluted on YPD agar in triplicate and colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined and compared to the expected 1\u00d7108 cell/mL. In total, eleven trial experiments were performed, eight without mice, and three utilizing mice (Table S2). Broth-grown Cryptococcus cells were passaged twice in 250 mL flasks containing 25 mL of YPD broth with shaking at 30\u00b0C overnight (8\u201312 hrs). Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 5 mL autoclaved millipore water. Cell density was determined by hemacytometer and 20 mL of a 1\u00d7108 cell/mL suspension were prepared for each strain. Cells subjected to drying prior to use in the Madison Chamber were grown in identical conditions to broth grown cells, but after the initial collection by centrifugation and resuspension in 5 mL water, cells were poured into a sterile petri plate, with the lid placed slightly ajar and allowed to air dry in a BSLII hood overnight. Cells were then collected, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standard density.",

In trials utilizing humidified air, the nebulizer air was mixed with humidified air (37\u00b11 lpm) as it entered the Madison Chamber. Humidified air was generated by two humidifiers connected in series (ZAB2-DT-S1-400-7, Lab Commerce Inc.). Humidity in the chamber was controlled from 30%\u2013100% relative humidity (RH) and was measured in real-time during the aerosol exposure. Nebulized and humidified air flow rates were controlled with AeroMP (Aerosol Management Platform, Biaera Technologies, LLC) [57]. The Madison Chamber was operated under negative pressure at \u221213\u00b11 inches of water column using a vacuum pump. Cryptococcus aerosols inside the Madison Chamber were sampled using an SKC BioSampler (SKC Inc, Model 225\u20139595) and aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, TSI Inc.). The start and stop operation of APS and BioSampler was controlled by AeroMP [57]. Particle size distribution by count and mass were measured by the APS at two-minute intervals for 30 seconds for the duration of the aerosol exposure. AeroMP was used to calculate the count mean aerodynamic diameter (CMAD) and mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). MMAD is used to describe a polydisperse aerosol particle size above and below which 50% of the mass of the particles is contained. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) was calculated using the particle size distributions by mass [60]. Aliquots obtained post-nebulization and from the BioSampler were dilution plated in triplicate on YPD agar, incubated at room temperature for two to four days and the average CFUs/mL was calculated. This data was utilized to determine the effect of nebulization on the viability of Cryptococcus cells by comparing the CFUs prior to nebulization and post-nebulization. Post-nebulization to Pre-nebulization ratio equal to or greater than one indicates 100% survival post nebulization, whereas a ratio value less than one indicates decreased viability post-nebulization. Viable aerosol density (Ca) was used to calculate spray factor (Fs), the ratio of viable aerosol concentration in the chamber to the starting inoculum density in the nebulizer [57], [59].",

            "text": "Mice were exposed to aerosols in three independent trial experiments (Table S2, Trial #5, #8, and #11). Delivery of aerosolized Cryptococcus cells to the lungs of mice was successful in all three trials. In the first preliminary mouse exposure, only 50% (EJB18, YPD-dried) to 75% (EJB18, Arabidopsis leaf agar) of mice exposed to aerosolized C. gattii at 70% RH for 20 minutes retained viable C. gattii one hour post exposure (Table S2). We observed that 100% of mice retain viable C. neoformans var. grubii cells within the lungs when mice were exposed for one hour at 95% RH. C. neoformans var. grubii H99\u03b1, KN99a, or the mated mixture with spores were aerosolized in individual exposures and the average doses retained were 2.07\u00d7102 cells/lung, 3.52\u00d7102 cells/lung, and 4.88\u00d7102 cells/lung, respectively (Figure 3). Although the dose retained for the mated mixtures with spores was 1.4\u00d7 (KN99a) and 2.4\u00d7 (H99\u03b1) higher than yeast alone, this difference was not statistically significant. Spleen and brain tissues were not colonized by Cryptococcus one hour post-exposure (Figure 3a). Over the 24 day duration of the experimental exposure, 100% of the mice displayed patterns of weight loss and significant increase of tissue burdens (lung, brain, and spleen), and one mouse expired prior to the 24 day time-point, consistent with disease development (Figure 3b). Additionally, we used C. neoformans var. grubii strains YSB119\u03b1 and KN99a NEO1 with drug resistance markers nourseothricin (NAT, YSB119\u03b1) or neomycin (NEO, KN99a NEO1) (Table S1). To consolidate exposures, we mixed YSB119\u03b1 and KN99a NEO1 in equal portions to use as the yeast only control for the mated mixtures containing yeast and spores. Similarly, we observed a lower dosed retained in mice exposed to yeast alone (8.8\u00d7101 cells/mouse) versus the yeast and spore mixtures (1.5\u00d7102 cells/mouse) (Figure 4). Although dose retained for the mated mixtures with spores was 1.7\u00d7 higher than yeast alone (YSB119\u03b1 and KN99a NEO1), this difference was not statistically significant. We were able to track the presence of NAT-, NEO-, and NAT- and NEO- resistant colonies from aerosolization to post-nebulization. Doubly-drug resistant colonies represented less than 0.001% of the cells obtained pre- and post-nebulization. We also noticed a large disparity between total CFUs on YPD agar and total CFUs of NEO-resistant cells, indicating a generalized loss of the NEO resistance marker (data not shown). After 3\u20134 weeks incubation we observed a loss of NEOR cells in the KN99a NEO1 strain incubated alone or in combination with YSB119\u03b1. After growth on V8 only 35% of the non-mated NEO marked parental strains retained NEO resistance. In contrast, 83% of NEOR cells isolated from mating colonies retained the NEO selective marker. After observing the loss of NEO resistance in the KN99a NEO1 strain we confirmed that the NEO marker was episomal and not integrated by PCR, which prevented the extension of this experiment to explore the role of spores in the infection process. In summary, we obtained NAT- and NEO-resistant colonies but did not observe double-drug resistant colonies in the BioSampler or from the lung tissues of mice.",

The MMAD distributions were similar but variable among trials and ranged from 1.0 \u00b5m\u20134.0 \u00b5m (Figure S2 and Table S2). However, the MMAD indicates that the particle size was consistently in the respirable range of less than 5 \u00b5m except for trial 6 in which the particle sizes ranged from 9.7 \u00b5m to 17.2 \u00b5m. The observed MMAD, CMAD, and GSD for C. neoformans and C. gattii were similar. MMAD of C. gattii ranged from 1.0 \u00b5m to 4 \u00b5m, CMAD 0.67 to 0.90, and GSD ranged from 1.2 to 2.95. The MMAD of C. neoformans var grubii ranged from 1.6 \u00b5m to 2.1 \u00b5m, CMAD 0.78 to 0.83, and GSD ranged from 1.8 to 2.74. In general, the observed MMAD was most consistent at 95% humidity. Particle size distribution by count and mass was variable and ranged up to 10 \u00b5m, but a higher concentration and mass of particles less than 5 \u00b5m were observed (Figure S3 to S6). The particle density and mass profiles for C. gattii (EJB18) were consistent over increased aerosolization time from 20 to 60 minutes (Figure S3). Agar grown C. gattii EJB18 exhibited one major particle diameter peak around 3 \u00b5m (Figure S4a, b, c) in contrast to the two peaks (\u223c1.5 \u00b5m and 3 \u00b5m) observed for broth grown cells (Figure S3). Agar grown Cryptococcus cells (Figure S4a, b, c) exhibited more consistent aerodynamic particle diameter, mass, and density profiles versus YPD-broth (Figure S4d, e) or YPD-dried cells (Figure S4f). During aerosolization of C. neoformans var. grubii (H99) particle density, mass, and size profiles remained consistent between 45% to 95% humidity (Figure S5). Broth-grown H99 cells (Figure S5) display a broad aerodynamic particle range in contrast to C. gattii EJB18 broth grown (Figure S3) or agar grown EJB18 cells (Figure S4). Particle mass, size, and density distributions were similar between H99 yeast cells and the mated mixture containing yeast and spores (Figure S6). The size of aerosolized C. neoformans var. grubii particles was stable during 20 minutes of exposure at 45%, 70% and 95% humidity (Figure S7a). The coefficient of variance of MMAD was 3.12% (45% RH), 3.54% (70% RH), and 3.83% (95% RH). The concentration of particles generated was more consistent at 70% and 95% RH than with 45% RH (Figure S7b). The coefficient of variance related to cell density was higher for 45% RH than 70% RH and 95% RH.",
