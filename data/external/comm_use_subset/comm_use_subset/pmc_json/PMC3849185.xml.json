            "text": "The phylogenetic analysis of viruses is a useful way to estimate their evolutionary relationships and assign genotypes. Until recently, the method commonly used for molecular phylogenetic studies for many viruses typically involved sequencing a gene or partial genomic region (phylogenetic marker) in individual representatives of a collection of strains and inferring a \u201cgene tree\u201d based on these sequences and declaring the gene tree to be the estimate of the tree of strain relationships [1]\u2013[4]. However, many studies have shown that the evolutionary histories of some individual genes or genomic regions may not be identical to each other within many viruses, which may be due to the recombination, reassortment and selection pressure [5]\u2013[15]. Therefore, several methods such as phylogenetic networks have been developed to infer these evolutionary processes including the recombination events. However, all these analyses could only provide accurate estimates only when all the whole-genome sequences are available [13]. In a molecular epidemiological survey, it is still expensive work to sequence the genome of every strain involved especially when the viral genomes are large, despite the decreasing cost of sequencing. For many viruses, a proper marker region used for the phylogenetic analysis can be still preferable in practical applications to infer the genetic relationships despite the fact that it may sometimes give some misleading assessments (Figure 1).",

And the sequences that have been fully reported in previous studies, with clear backgrounds and well annotated genome structures were preferred. For the viral strains with conflicting sequences, the sequence meeting the above criteria described above was selected. If the whole-genome sequences of several strains were identical, only one whole-genome sequence was retained. All data were collected before 1 October, 2013. Firstly, 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were used in the general calculations (Table S1 and Table S2). To allow comparisons to be made, large sets of PCV2 sequences (123 strains and 224 strains; Text S1) were also obtained for another calculation. The genomic region sequences for each virus were obtained depending on reference genomes annotated in the NCBI. The main genes (rep and cap) of PCV2, genes coding for structural proteins (N, P, M, F, H and L) and non-structural proteins (C and V) of MV, several genomic regions (MJ-C, GO, KLY-B, MXJ and SGG-A) depending on the literature [7] from HEV and genes coding for structural proteins (E, PreM and cap) and non-structural protein (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) of JEV were obtained from the selected genomes respectively.

This is consistent with the fact that the N gene and H gene sequences are most commonly recommended for the genetic characterization of wild-type viruses [27], [34]-[36]. Although the L gene could reproduce the genome tree well, the large size of sequence limits its utility. For PCV2 which has the smallest genome in the circoviridae family, encoding only two major proteins (rep and cap), the cap gene correlated more strongly and more stably with the full genome than the rep gene in its evolutionary rate, which is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis based on tree comparison (Figure 3). This is fully supported by the study of Olvera et al [6], who considered that the cap gene was a more reliable phylogenetic marker for PCV2 strains because it was able to reconstruct the same tree as the whole viral genome. The cap gene shows much greater variability than the rep gene, which may be due to the fact that the cap protein is the most exposed part of the virus and is the most likely to interact with the host immune system [6], [37]. In JEV, the E gene has been given precedence when there is discordance between the E and other genes because it has been shown to be a better predictor of phylogenies determined by complete genomes [9]. And the NS1 gene and NS5 gene have been also proved as good reference genes for genotypic assignment [16], [38], [39]. In this study, we found that the E and NS5 gene showed the strongest and relatively constant correlation values (0.996) with the full-length genome and the NS1 gene also show a higher r-value (0.993) with the genome (Figure 4). It has been known that some genomic regions for HEV genotyping can correlate well with the results from the phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome [7], [40], [41]. The MJ-C region in the viral RdRp domain has been identified as a substitute for the full-length genome when assigning genotypes [7]. We have drawn the same conclusion as that study by calculating the evolutionary correlations between the HEV genome and the selected regions from the previous study. The MJ-C region showed the highest r-value (0.983) with the full genome, indicating the MJ-C region is evolving in a rate more correlatively with the HEV genome across all the selected regions. However, according to our results (Figure 4), all the regions of HEV selected for our analysis, including the MJ-C region, showed unstable evolutionary correlations with the genome based on different genome samples. This may suggest that they may be inappropriate for phylogenetic analysis, which was supported by the unreliable bootstrap values in the phylogenetic trees (Figure S3) and may arise partly from the limited informative sites in all the selected regions with sequences short in length.",

            "text": "A limited number of samples can negatively affect the sensitivity of the method. Our analysis of differently sized samples of viral strains, as well as random and repetitive sampling of PCV2, showed empirically that an insufficient sample size, which was less than 10, may negatively affect the stability and reliability of r-values (Figure 5 and Table S5). This may result from insufficient informative variation of each sequence for detection, the limitations of statistical method itself and/or the potential specific variability in evolutionary history. Consequently, an empirical restriction will be recommended that the minimum sample size is 10. Furthermore, no significant difference was found between the results based on a small number (43 strains) and those based on large numbers (123 and 224 strains) of PCV2 viruses. Another factor, the sample source also seemed to play an important role in the calculation for the r-values. While the r-values changed with the different selection of PCV2 strains, it had no influence on the comparison for judgment because of the clear trend between r-values when the size of sample was sufficiently large. Sufficient information can be provided by more representative strains from different lineages. Moreover, the comparison between the results from calculations with all the selected strains (Table 1) and those of several randomly selected groups with different numbers revealed that estimates from different sample sizes and sample sources (Figure 4 and Figure 5) were consistent with that from one specific calculation with enough number of representative strains. Therefore, a reliable estimate can be made when the calculation is based on a sufficient number of representative strains. In practice, the r-values would be calculated based on several groups of randomly selected strain sources with the sufficient number, which would yield a more reliable assessment.",

Our method can only give estimates of the correlated evolution level between individual genomic regions and the whole genome of some viruses and then provide the useful information for determining the proper phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology.
