Dysregulation of these processes is a major factor in the emergence of many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major forms of signal transduction and can affect protein function and gene expression [1]\u2013[7]. Investigations into phosphorylation provide insight into signaling pathways by providing the target sites of phosphorylation and the quantitative changes in phosphorylation level in response to genetic or environmental perturbations. Effective, sensitive identification of candidate proteins for further studies remains a challenge in the face of experimental limitations of current technologies which have a high cost component, provide incomplete coverage of the phosphoproteome, and have sampling limitations which affect replicate runs.",

In the study carried out by Bodenmiller at al.\n[5], protein kinases and phosphatases were systematically perturbed through gene deletions. The system-wide responses to the perturbations were measured by label-free MS-based quantification, and the results evaluated to determine their contributions to understanding the relationships between these signal transduction proteins and cell pathways. Another global interaction study focused on kinase and phosphatase interactions [6] by capturing protein-protein interactions by affinity capture-immunoblot and identifying the isolated protein complexes by mass spectrometry. These two global studies both adopted label-free, cost-effective quantitative approaches. However, label-free methods typically increase variance relative to isotope enrichment methods [11]. For the purpose of this study, we have used isotope labeled SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) method [12], [13] to increase sensitivity to change.",

The phosphoproteome data utilized in this analysis was obtained from interventional experiments of a subset of yeast kinases involved in filamentous growth. Filamentous growth is a developmental transition observed in S. cerevisiae where yeast cells form elongated and connected multicellular filaments; these filaments resemble hyphae but lack the parallel-sided walls and structure of true hyphal tubes. This pseudohyphal growth transition is induced in response to several cell stresses, including nitrogen stress, growth in the presence of short-chain alcohols, and glucose stress [14]\u2013[17]. The filamentous growth form presumably represents a foraging mechanism enabling non-motile yeast to better survive cell stress [14]. During pseudohyphal growth, yeast cells elongate due to a delay in the G2/M transition, exhibit an altered budding pattern, and remain connected after cytokinesis [18], [19]. The resulting pseudohyphal filaments extend superficially from a colony over an agar substrate and invasively downward into the solid substrate below the colony. In liquid culture under inducing conditions, a filamentous strain of yeast exhibits elongated cells and multicellular filaments encompassing typically 3\u20134 cells. It is important to note that most laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae are non-filamentous and that studies of filamentous growth are typically performed in the \u22111278b strain, which we employ here.",

            "text": "The molecular basis of filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae is broad in scope. Classic studies have identified key kinase-based signaling networks that regulate the filamentous growth transition. In particular, yeast filamentous growth is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways [15], [20], [21] as well as being impacted by other signaling pathways. MAPK pathways are evolutionarily conserved across phyla and consist of three-kinase cascades serving central roles in signal transduction in eukaryotic cells [22]; the yeast filamentous growth MAPK cascade terminates in the MAPK Kss1p. In S. cerevisiae, PKA consists of the regulatory subunit Bcy1p and one of three catalytic subunits Tpk1p, Tpk2p, or Tpk3p; Tpk2p is known to be required for filamentous growth [23]\u2013[25]. It should be noted that the Kss1p MAPK pathway is required for pseudohyphal growth induced by both nitrogen stress and butanol, while the genes GPR1, MEP2, and GPA2, acting upstream of PKA, are not required for butanol-induced filamentous growth [16]. In our experiments, we treated cells with 1% (vol/vol) butanol to induce filamentous growth [26]. A graphical illustration of currently recognized budding yeast filamentous growth pathways, integrating information from authoritative pathway databases and reviews, is shown in Figure 1. While these core signaling units are well defined, the downstream scope of their signaling networks is unclear.",

The kinase-dead alleles of these proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The system-wide phosphorylation responses of the mutant strains were determined using SILAC approach, and we used the Mascot search engine [29] followed by MaxQuant software [30] to identify and quantify peptides and proteins.

Bioinformatics methods provide a promising avenue with which local kinase signaling relationships can be identified. While traditional cluster analyses associated with functional enrichment analysis are useful tools, their performance might be affected by the missing value issue. We need to deal with it in order to obtain reliable clusters and enriched functions. Furthermore, a more integrative and extensive analysis is necessary to find new components of the pathways, uncover relationships between the pathway components, and to elaborate the signaling network structure. Thus we propose this comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for SILAC data, and partially compensate the missing value issue. The major building blocks include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, causal relationship discovery, and validation by literature mining. We have successfully applied the pipeline to analyze our current yeast data. Candidate proteins predicted to contribute to the filamentous growth response were selected by phosphopeptide meta-analysis and correlation network analysis. Causal relationship discovery was performed on candidate proteins identified from our analysis and validated proteins from the literature. The inferred causal relationships, along with the interactions inferred from phosphorylation changes in response to individual mutants, have suggested potential proteins that can be further intervened and studied in the future.",

Because a peptide quantified for one sample is highly likely to be quantifiable for the other two samples in the same triplex, the identification and quantification of phosphopeptides in a triplex experiment tend to be linked. In other words, the overlap within a triplex run should be near 100% but the overlap between different triplex runs will be lower due to instrument sampling limitations. A high number of replicates may help minimize missing data, and compensate for the possible bias introduced by tied identification and quantification; but it is rarely performed due to the high cost of these analyses.",

The results are illustrated in Figure S1 in Text S1. The assignment of proteins and peptides in the top 8 tight clusters is provided in Table 2 and Dataset S1. We also surveyed enriched functions in the tight clusters (Table 2), in terms of functional categories, Gene Ontology, pathways and proteins Domains [27], [32]\u2013[34]. In summary, similar phosphorylation change patterns over multiple mutants (compared to wild type) tends to suggest involvement in similar biological functions.

Each selected phosphopeptide satisfies the following criteria: the combined p-value < 0.05, q-value < 0.05 for controlling false discovery rate (FDR) [36], and the significance B value < 0.05 in at least 4 out of 8 kinase-dead mutant (KD) versus wild type (WT) conditions.

To determine if these proteins do in fact impact filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae, we constructed haploid strains singly deleted for each gene and assayed for filamentation phenotypes. Precise gene deletions were carried out using a standard PCR-based strategy, and resulting haploid strains were assayed for invasive growth by standard plate-washing assays under normal growth conditions [17]. Invasive growth, characterized by filament penetration into the agar substrate, was decreased upon deletion of PBI2 relative to wild-type. In addition, the deletion of NTH1, PDR12, and RCN2 yielded exaggerated invasive growth relative to an otherwise isogenic wild-type strain. Results are shown in Figure 7. All four proteins have been previously implicated in various yeast stress responses, but not specifically with respect to filamentous growth [38], [52], [57]\u2013[63]. Nth1p, i.e. neutral trehalase, is involved in the trehalose pathway, which is a glucose storage pathway [64]. Pbi2p is a cytosolic inhibitor of vacuolar proteinase B, and is involved in the regulation of proteolysis [65]\u2013[69]. Rcn2p, a regulator of calcineurin [70], is induced in response to DNA-damaging agents [59]. Pdr12p is a multidrug transporter inducible by weak acid, and is required for weak organic acid resistance [71], [72].

In order to increase sensitivity to smaller changes in phosphorylation relative to previous yeast global phosphoproteome studies [5], [6], we used SILAC, an isotope labeling approach. Isotope labeling approaches are generally more precise relative to label-free approaches [11], but require greater resources to implement, resulting in trade-offs between precision and missing data due to sampling limitations inherent to current instruments. We proposed and developed a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis pipeline for the post-identification studies of phosphoproteome data. The analyses are aimed at discovering candidate components of significant pathways involved in filamentous growth as well as the potential targets of the pathways, and to provide more information on the signaling network structure by monitoring changes in phosphorylation in response to mutational interventions. We applied the pipeline to analyze our interim high mass accuracy yeast phosphoproteome datasets and a total of 882 unique phosphopeptides representing 486 proteins were identified as significantly influenced by at least one out of 8 kinase-dead mutants. Twenty-eight unique phosphopeptides having globally significant phosphorylation were identified from the whole dataset among which 5 peptides representing 5 proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Rcn2p, Pdr12p and Hsp42p, were identified as high-confidence candidates. Nineteen candidate proteins with relatively high degrees of connectivity were selected as hub proteins in the stringent correlation network (Pbi2p and Hsp42p were identified as hub proteins too). Among the high-confidence candidate proteins, 3 proteins have been previously reported to be directly involved in filamentous growth and another 6 proteins were also supported, in terms of genetic and physical interactions with known components involved in filamentous growth. The remaining proteins have been implicated in various other stress responses and may play roles in filamentous growth or may be secondary stress responders. In particular, we validated four candidate proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p as impacting invasive growth. Causal relationship discovery was further performed on the candidates and validated proteins. The inferred causal relationships, along with the interactions inferred from phosphorylation changes in response to individual mutants, form phosphoprotein interaction networks, which suggested potential proteins to be intervened in future studies.",

The sensitivity of such detection is constrained by the degree of overlap between pathways, the coverage of pathways by the mutants, and the extent of missing data.

This feature of tandem mass spectra of complex mixtures results in poor overlap of peptides identified across samples unless a relatively large number of replicate experiments are carried out (which is time consuming and often economically impractical for large-scale projects). For this reason, a significant number of missing values exist in these datasets which can obscure potential candidates for further validation studies. This is likely to be alleviated to some extent in the future as mass spectrometry technologies continue to improve, but we have developed methods to partially compensate for the missing data issue. In the phosphopeptide meta-analysis, an extension of Fisher's combined probability test was made to relax the restrictions of complete measurements. The causal network modeling component was also developed to allow missing values without excluding the incomplete measurements. We also performed cluster analysis of phosphopeptides. Instead of adopting traditional clustering methods, we directly identified the most stable clusters using missing value-imputed data. Our approach was able to pick out significantly enriched functions, and identify a number of reliable candidate proteins for further validation of which four were validated.",

Different Lys and Arg isotope forms were used to label the three samples in a triplex SILAC experiment: light (Lys0/Arg0) for WT control sample, medium (Lys4/Arg6) and heavy (Lys8/Arg10) for two different mutant samples. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In SILAC experiments, samples were pooled at the harvest stage before protein extraction. Samples pooled at this early stage can reduce both systematic and random errors that may occur in later sample preparation [79], [80], thus the results have smaller variance compared to unpooled samples. Small sample sizes (two or three replicates) is acceptable for the low-variance SILAC experimental design. We observed in our SILAC experiments that the majority of the ratio \u201cvariability\u201d in the data was less than 20.
