            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, life-limiting disease characterized by airway inflammation, infection, progressive obstructive lung disease and lung function decline [1]. Lung involvement is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF [2]. It is known in older children and adults that pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) lead to lung function decline [3]. However, the effect of PEx on clinical outcomes in young children with CF is not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that airway inflammation [4, 5] and bronchiectasis [6\u20138] occur in infants and preschoolers with CF indicating that lung damage occurs early in life. Additionally, newborn screening has led to earlier diagnosis and provides an opportunity for medical interventions to slow the progression of lung disease [9, 10].",

Most PEx in children are treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics [11]; thus, we captured these events as well as hospitalizations. We employed oropharyngeal cultures, the standard of care in the United States for monitoring airway infections in non-expectorating patients, to determine airway microbiology. We hypothesized that those with more frequent PEx during the study period would have worse clinical outcomes at the conclusion of the study (CXR scores) and at school age (lung function).",

Potential subjects were approached and recruited for the study during regularly scheduled clinic visits. Subjects completed study visits at their quarterly CF clinic visits and at the time of clinician defined PEx for 2 years (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The determination of a PEx was based on two criteria: 1) diagnosis by the primary CF provider and 2) initiation of oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics for respiratory symptoms. A standardized definition of PEx was not used in order to capture all antibiotic courses that were prescribed. However, using criteria from the Inhaled Hypertonic Saline in Infants Study (ISIS), the subjects\u2019 signs and symptoms as well as reasons for treatment with antibiotics were retrospectively analyzed to determine how many of these encounters would have been classified as exacerbations based on standardized criteria [12].\n",

Cough severity was assessed at each visit by parent and physician report using an ordinal cough score ranging from 0 (no cough) to 3 (frequent) for parent report of day and nighttime symptoms and from 0 (no cough) to 4 (frequent) for cough during physician exam (Wisconsin Cough Score), with a maximum possible score of 10 [14].

Descriptive statistics were used to define the baseline demographic characteristics of this cohort. We determined the relationship between factors using Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals; correlations with an absolute magnitude of 0.3 or greater were considered clinically significant. Average and standard error estimates for Wisconsin cough scores were obtained across study visit type (stable, exacerbation) using an analysis of variance and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated scores within subjects. Percent predicted for follow-up pulmonary function tests were calculated using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations.

Other studies have also demonstrated that chest radiographs may have value in monitoring the progression of CF lung disease [18]. Spirometry is a less sensitive marker of structural damage in mild disease [19]; thus, particularly in young children, it may be that abnormalities in spirometry will only become apparent after longer follow up times. This may explain why the number of exacerbations was associated with worse chest x-ray scores but not with spirometry values. A potentially more sensitive marker of lung disease, lung clearance index (LCI) has been compared to spirometry including FEV1 in several studies. Abnormalities in LCI are detected earlier than abnormalities in FEV1 [20\u201323]. Worsening LCI measurements over time have been shown in young children with CF compared to healthy controls, whereas, no difference in the rate of decline in FEV1 compared to healthy controls was found [24]. These studies suggest that LCI may be a more sensitive marker of early disease progression compared to FEV1 in young children with CF.",

We speculate that spirometry values were not lower in the setting of an increased number of PEx due to the increased use of antibiotic therapy in these patients.

In contrast to our findings, Byrnes and colleagues demonstrated that exacerbations in the first 2 years of life were associated with lower FEV1 values at age 5 [25]. Our cohort differs from the Australian cohort where a higher rate of prophylactic antibiotics and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were noted [25]. The increased use of prophylactic antibiotics in this cohort may have impacted both exacerbation frequency and later lung function contributing to the differences in findings. Ramsey and colleagues noted that patients who received prophylactic antibiotics in the first 2 years of life had higher FEV0.75 and FVC compared to those who did not receive them [26].",

Stanojevic and coworkers performed a retrospective study of 570 adult and pediatric CF patients (median age of 21 years) and assessed the impact of exacerbations treated with oral antibiotics on lung function [29].
