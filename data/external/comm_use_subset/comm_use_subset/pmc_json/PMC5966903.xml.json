            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes acute respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate in human [1]. The first case of MERS-CoV was identified in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. From the initial outbreak to April 2018, MERS-CoV spread through 27 countries and caused approximately 2144 cases and 750 deaths (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is also known as CD26, was identified as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV [2, 3]. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with approximately 26\u201332 kb genomic RNA [4\u20136]. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the viral genome consists of open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b that encode the viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), whereas the 3\u2032 one-third consists of ORFs that encode the viral structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), and accessory proteins. The S, M and E proteins form the viral envelope [7\u20139], whereas the N protein is considered the most important protein that interacts with the viral genomic RNA and packages the RNA into virus particles by recognizing a specific sequence, which is termed the packaging signal [10\u201312].",

A stable stem-loop of 69-nucleotides (nt) was identified as sufficient for RNA packaging. Computer analysis further revealed conservation of the packaging signal in both the sequence and RNA secondary structure between MHV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and among other lineage A betacoronaviruses [16\u201318]. Our previous studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is a lineage B betacoronavirus, identified a 580-nt RNA fragment with a stable stem-loop structure as a functional signal to drive packaging of coexpressed RNA of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) into virus-like particles (VLPs) [19]. This SARS-CoV packaging signal spanned the viral genome from nt 19,715 to 20,294 and was localized to a subdomain of the nsp15 gene different from the packaging signal of lineage A betacoronaviruses. However, studies on alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) localized the RNA packaging signal to the 5\u2032-end of the viral genome [20, 21], and sequences in the 5\u2019-UTR and/or 3\u2019-UTR may be required for the RNA packaging of gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [22, 23].",

            "text": "In addition to the packaging signal, the viral structural proteins may also play roles in the assembly of the viral genome. Studies on MHV indicated that M and E proteins are sufficient for the assembly of VLPs [9]. Through a specific interaction between the viral M protein and the packaging signal, a coexpressed RNA fragment carrying the viral packaging signal can be packaged into VLPs in the absence of N protein [24, 25]. Nevertheless, studies argue for the involvement of the N protein in RNA genome packaging. The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the N protein was demonstrated to be the major determinant of MHV packaging signal recognition [11]; and the further downstream carboxy-terminal tail coordinates the selectivity of genome packaging and couples genome encapsidation to the virion assembly [26]. In addition, our earlier study on SARS-CoV indicated N protein-dependent assembly of the viral RNA packaging signal [19]. To date, the RNA packaging signal of MERS-CoV has not been determined, and it is unclear whether the N protein is essential for the MERS-CoV RNA package.",

However, the packaging signal of lineage C betacoronavirus MERS-CoV has not been determined. Based on the observations that a stable stem\u2013loop structure is often a prerequisite for an RNA fragment to be a packaging signal and that unique sequences may determine the packaging specificity of different coronavirus lineages, we proposed the analysis of the genome sequence and the structure of different lineage betacoronaviruses for the prediction of the potential packaging signal of MERS-CoV. The whole genome sequence of MERS-CoV was first compared with lineage B betacoronavirus SARS-CoV by alignment with NCBI blastn. This revealed a highly variable region from nt 19,757 to 20,434 of the MERS-CoV genome located at the 3\u2032 end of ORF 1b and between two regions that have the highest conservation (the alignment score was higher than 200; Fig. 1a, top). Interestingly, this variable region overlaps the PS580 RNA fragment spanning nt 19,715 to 20,294 of the SARS-CoV genome, which has been identified as a functional packaging signal [19]. In addition, when the MERS-CoV RNA sequence was compared with that of the lineage A betacoronavirus MHV, the divergent sequence was localized to a similar but shorter fragment spanning nt 19,756 to 20,182 of the MERS-CoV genome (Fig. 1a, bottom). These results located a highly variable region of the genome sequences among the different lineage betacoronaviruses. Secondary structures of the MERS-CoV RNA(19757\u201320434) and RNA(19756\u201320182) were then analyzed (Fig. 1b). Two RNA subdomains of 94-nt (nt 19,801 to 19,894) and 152-nt (nt 20,022 to 20,173) that form stable structures in both RNA fragments were identified as potential packaging signals of MERS-CoV.",

To examine the packaging activity of the PS258(19712\u201319969)ME RNA fragment, the plasmid pEGFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)ME that expresses heterologous mRNA GFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)ME was generated. Cotransfection was performed with the plasmids encoding MERS-CoV structural proteins and plasmid pEGFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)ME. In addition, plasmid pEGFP-N-PS580 that encodes the GFP-PS580 RNA fragment containing the SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal was applied to examine the specificity of the viral RNA packaging. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of the viral structural proteins was detected in cell lysates (panel a) and in both the cellular and supernatant VLPs (panel b; VLP, VLP/PSME, and VLP/PSSA). Assembly of the GFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)ME into MERS VLPs (VLP/PSME) was examined by incubating the VLPs with the virus-permissible Huh7 cells that endogenously express the viral receptor hDPP4 [2]. As shown in Fig. 3c, GFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)ME RNA that assembled into the VLP/PSME was evident by the detection of GFP expression upon entering the cells. The expression of GFP was not detected in Huh7 cells coincubating with VLPs collected from the culture medium of cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding the MERS-CoV structural proteins and the control vector pEGFP-N1 (Fig. 3c; VLP). These results demonstrated that the PS258(19712\u201319969)ME RNA fragment bears a functional packaging signal that is critical for the assembly of the viral RNA into the MERS VLPs. In the absence of the MERS-CoV RNA sequences, GFP RNA alone was not assembled or expressed in the VLPs. In addition, no GFP expression was detected when the Huh7 cells were incubated with VLPs collected from the culture medium of cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding MERS-CoV structural proteins and the plasmid that encodes the heterologous mRNA GFP-PS580 containing the SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal (Fig. 3c; VLP/PSSA), which indicated that the SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal could not be assembled into MERS VLPs.

As shown in Fig. 4b, an interaction between the biotinylated SL19805ME and the MERS-CoV N protein was detected. However, no signals were observed with the protein control BSA and in the control groups of unlabeled and biotin-labeled RNA.

            "text": "Although the structure of the full-length MERS-CoV N protein has not been determined, a recent study revealed structural features of the N-terminal region of MERS-CoV in common with SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses [28\u201330]. The N protein of coronavirus is structurally organized into two domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), which are separated by a flexible linker (Fig. 5). The NTD structure is organized as an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet core domain with disordered loops, whereas the CTD is composed of mainly \u03b1-helices. Previous studies demonstrated that the CTD of the SARS-CoV N protein is involved in oligomerization to form a capsid structure, whereas both domains may be involved in RNA binding [19, 30\u201334]. In addition, the linker is able to modulate the RNA binding activity of the NTD and CTD [35]. In this study, the RNA-binding characteristics of the MERS-CoV N protein were examined by analyzing the interactions between the SL19805ME RNA and various fragments of the N protein. Following expression and purification of the His-tagged N proteins (Fig. 5a), a filter binding assay was performed. The results demonstrated the RNA binding activities of the full-length N protein and both the N(1\u2013263) and N(239\u2013413) fragments that represent the NTD plus the flexible linker and the CTD, respectively (Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, when deleting a part of the \u03b2-sheet structure of the NTD, the N(1\u2013156) fragment had a lower RNA-binding activity compared to that of the N(1\u2013263) fragment, which indicated that the structural integrity of the NTD could be important for RNA binding. However, a 25-amino-acid N-terminal deletion from the N(239\u2013413) fragment, which generated the N(264\u2013413) fragment, had little effect on the RNA-binding activity. These results indicate that both the NTD and CTD of the MERS-CoV N protein could interact with SL19805ME, which is a 45-nt stable stem-loop structure in the viral RNA packaging signal.",

Nevertheless, the binding activity was much lower than that of the SL19805ME. This result suggests that interaction of the viral RNA with the N protein may be a prerequisite but not sufficient for RNA packaging into VLPs.

In addition, subsequent interactions between the N protein and other viral structural proteins may facilitate assembly of the viral RNA into VLPs.",

Further studies demonstrated that the 258-nt PS258(19712\u201319969)ME RNA fragment could function as a packaging signal and drive the packaging of the heterologous GFP gene into the MERS VLPs (Fig. 3c).

In addition, the packaging signal selectively interacts with the viral M protein, which drives the packaging of the viral RNA into the virus particles [25]. Studies on various coronaviruses indicate that coronaviruses could package the RNA fragments containing their own packaging signals [15, 16, 19]. In this study, we further demonstrated that MERS VLPs could package the PS258(19712\u201319969)ME RNA fragment of MERS-CoV, but not the SARS-CoV packaging signal PS580 (Fig. 3c). This suggests a specificity of the MERS-CoV RNA packaging. In addition, the involvement of the N protein in genome packaging may vary among the different coronaviruses. Previous studies demonstrate an N-dependent packaging of the SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal [19], but an N-independent packaging of the MHV RNA fragment was also suggested [24, 25]. In this study, an N-dependent packaging of MERS-CoV RNA was demonstrated (Fig. 3c).",

Previous studies demonstrated the involvement of both the structural domains in binding the RNA of SARS-CoV and MHV (either independently or cooperatively as a bipartite) and showed the involvement of the C-terminal domain in oligomerization of the N protein [19, 30\u201334, 36\u201338]. In this study, the RNA-binding activity was demonstrated for the full-length N protein and both the N(1\u2013263) and N(239\u2013413) fragments that represent the NTD plus the flexible central linker region and the CTD, respectively (Fig. 5). The reduced RNA-binding activity of the N(1\u2013156) fragment may indicate a critical role of the structural integrity of NTD. Alternatively, the central linker region may play a role in RNA binding. However, the N(264\u2013413) fragment that lacks the N-terminal 25 amino acids of the N(239\u2013413) fragment has an RNA-binding activity comparable to the N(239\u2013413). This is different from the observation that the absence of the N-terminal 22 amino acids of SARS CoV N protein CTD significantly diminished its interaction with RNA [31]. Critical structures and sequences of the MERS-CoV N protein involved in RNA binding could be further studied. The MERS VLP system, which was established here for studying virus assembly and infection, could be used as a model system for evaluation of the efficacy of antiviral drugs.",
