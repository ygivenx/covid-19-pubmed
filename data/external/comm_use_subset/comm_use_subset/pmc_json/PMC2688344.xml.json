Upon diagnosis, most patients already have developed locally advanced or metastasised disease. More will develop metastasis during follow-up. Though, when diagnosed and treated early, the overall 5-year survival rate is around 90%. Unfortunately, there are currently no suitable tumour markers for early diagnosis of CRC. Non-invasive diagnostic methods that could be suitable for screening patients, such as measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, faecal occult blood testing and faecal DNA analysis, all have low sensitivities and/or specificities (2\u20135).",

Microarray analyses have yielded highly predictive prognostic profiles for e.g. breast cancer (6). However, genomic analyses depend on the availability of tissue material to assess acquired genetic changes and are thus less suitable for screening large populations or follow-up of patients after surgery. In contrast, proteomic profiling can be done in easily-accessible body fluids like serum, which can be assessed before, during and after (treatment for) CRC. As tissue is constantly perfused by the blood, (tumour) tissue-originating proteins, but also tissue-processed endogenous proteins are represented in the blood and can reflect the actual state of an individual\u2019s health.",

To assess large sample groups, a high throughput method that does not need much pre-analytical sample clean-up is preferable. We and others have previously searched for CRC serum protein profiles with surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) (8\u201313). Although much debate has surrounded this technology, several discriminating proteins in these studies overlapped, indicating inter-laboratory reproducibility and validity. However, in these studies most CRC patients had advanced disease and were compared to healthy controls. As the ultimate goal is to use protein profiling for early diagnosis, possibly even in pre-cancerous stages, prospective studies are needed in a more heterogeneous population of patients at risk. Furthermore, for protein profiles to be suitable for follow-up of CRC patients, their levels should be reflective of response to treatment or relapse.",

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale clinical study in which previously established CRC serum protein profiles are validated in a clinically relevant population of patients with an indication for colonoscopy. Of the 690 eligible patients who were asked to participate in this study, 609 were evaluable for serum analysis (88.3%). Small differences between the evaluable and non-evaluable patients were the older age of the latter group and different indications and diagnoses for colonoscopy. Comparison of latter indicates that patients with the least and most severe diagnosis were most likely to be non-evaluable. That is, patients whose complaints disappeared were more likely to miss colonoscopy, whereas patients with CRC were more likely to give no consent because of their disease. The omission of these extremes in the eligible population may have precluded the detection of more differences between patients and controls. We confirmed the decreased expression of m/z 3.3 and 6.6 kDa, two ions of apolipoprotein C-I, in the current population of CRC patients. Recently we have shown that one of our earlier biomarker candidates, an N-terminal albumin fragment of 3.1 kDa, is a product of proteolysis during storage at \u221220 \u00b0C (16), explaining why we did not observe this peak in this analysis. The lack of an expression difference for peaks at 4472 Da and 28 kDa is likely related to the different patient characteristics or sample handling protocol compared to our previous study. We did not find any significant differences between pre- and post-surgery serum protein profiles. As apolipoprotein C-I is synthesised mainly by the liver and small intestine (17), it is plausible that resection of the tumour does not immediately influence the abundance of this protein. However, we observed a correlation between the post-surgery peak intensities of m/z 3.3 and 6.6 kDa and the time between surgery and serum collection, indicating that apolipoprotein C-I levels do return to normal, but with a time-lag of about 3 months after surgery (data not shown). Also for CEA a time lag of 6 to 12 weeks levels after surgery is common before levels return to normal.",

We expected that the potential to classify patients by their serum protein profile would be lower in the current population, since we compared patients with early-stage disease to a control group which was essentially not \u2018healthy\u2019. Because of this, more background noise was introduced in this analysis. However, an analysis in this population is essential for assessment of the clinical utility of this type of mass spectrometric profiling. Importantly, we could not discern patients with AP from CON, which would be advantageous in establishing which patients need a colonoscopy for removal of AP. Quantitative methods are needed to determine the actual differences in serum levels of apolipoprotein C-I between CON, AP and CRC. Then, suitable cut-off levels can be established for clinical use. Such an approach was taken e.g. by Habermann et al., who used an ELISA for quantitation of complement C3a des-Arg and validated their MS results (13). Although others have suggested serum protein profiles on a different chip surface with good sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination of AP and CRC (9), these results remain to be validated in larger patient groups. Therefore, the current serum protein profiles can as yet not replace endoscopic screening. In addition, regarding the specificity of apolipoprotein C-I for CRC, we must remark that a similar decrease of apolipoprotein C-I or protein peaks with similar mass has been described in several other types of cancer and benign disease (10; 18; 19). Hence, its potential usefulness for CRC seems confined to follow-up of patients.",

In addition we compared discriminating serum proteins with those in tissue. We found a protein peak of 6.6 kDa, which might represent apolipoprotein C-I, in tissue samples. Contrary to serum, these peaks exhibited a higher abundance in CRC than in AP and CON. However, serum protein levels do not necessarily reflect the processes occurring in tissue. For example, apolipoprotein A-I can be decreased in serum due to less synthesis in the liver, but increased in tissue due to local synthesis (10; 20). A gradual increase of the 6.6-kDa peak and others was obvious looking only at the different histologic subtypes of polyps, indicating that these subtypes indeed reflect the extent of transformation of these polyps. Also, a relationship between peak intensity and polyp size was observed for some peaks, which indicates that polyp size could be a surrogate measure for the extent of malignant transformation. Whether hyperplastic polyps are in fact pre-malignant stages of CRC, as is suggested by the hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (21), and not innocent polyps, remains to be established by direct comparison of hyperplastic polyp and normal tissue protein profiles. Normal tissue was not analysed in the current study, as we did not attempt to find diagnostic tissue proteins, because of the limited utility of tissue as a matrix for screening purposes due to the need for colonoscopy.",

In the current study we also found peaks with masses corresponding to these proteins, namely m/z 3442, 3375 and 3493. Only the first peak was also found increased in CRC compared to AP and CON in our study. In the pair wise comparison of CON and CRC, we found m/z 3493 borderline significantly increased in CRC (p = 0.019). The facts that we did not compare normal mucosa to CRC and used whole tumour tissue instead of microdissected tumour cells are likely the cause of the discrepancies with published reports. Whereas others have also reported the presence of these peptides in serum and suggested their potential as serum markers (22; 23), we did not detect them in serum under the current binding conditions. The potential of the \u03b1-defensins as diagnostic biomarkers for CRC seems limited, as their serum levels are also increased in other cancers and several benign immunological conditions. Furthermore, our tissue protein profiling results indicate that their expression is only increased in CRC and not yet in polyps, hampering their use for the identification of polyps with malignant potential. Yet, as suggested previously, they may be useful as markers for CRC prognosis and monitoring (24). Unlike Melle et al. (25; 26) we did not observe a significant expression difference between AP and CRC at 10.84 or 12.0 kDa that could correspond to heat shock protein 10 or calgizzarin. This may also be caused by the above-mentioned difference in tissue processing.",
