            "text": "Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the strongest organic poison for humans and animals. It is produced by the anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium Clostridium botulinum [1,2]. The estimated human lethal dose is about 10 nanograms per kilogram of bodyweight if the toxin is inhaled and one microgram if it is taken orally [3,4]. The most common forms of natural botulism are food-borne, wound, and infant [2]. Food-borne botulism occurs through contaminated food ingestion, and the case fatality rate is now about 5\u201310% in developed countries (as opposed to 60\u201370% before 1950). Wound botulism occurs when an open wound is exposed to C. botulinum spores, and the case fatality is approximately 10\u201315% of patients even with aggressive treatment. Infant intestinal botulism occurs with spores ingested and spread over the digestive tract, as infants lack the protective flora of adults, with case fatality rate estimated to be le,ss than 1\u20132%. Inhalation botulism does not occur naturally and may occur in the context of a bioterrorist attack [2,5]. Among the four major human pathogenic BoNTs (BoNT/A, B, E, and F), BoNT/A poses the most serious challenge for medical treatment due to its extremely high potency and extraordinary persistence in human patients [6]. According to the World Health Organization [7], an antitoxin, usually based on equine antitoxin, should be administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. However, side effects, such as allergic reactions, fever serum sickness, and anaphylactic shock, often occur. In the past, at-risk persons and populations have been vaccinated with a chemically inactivated penta-serotype BoNT/A-E toxoid [8]; however, its use has been discontinued due to declining potency [9]. In other affected individuals, botulism treatment is mainly supportive, with mechanical ventilation being the only effective life-saving treatment [10,11].",

            "text": "A good alternative to antitoxin serum with minimal or no side effects is treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to BoNT, which can be prduced in vitro. Along with conventional antibodies, single-domain antibodies (sdAb), also referred to as VHHs (variable domains of heavy-chain only stibodies) or nanobodies, have been widely used since their discovery in camelids along with classical immunoglobulins (IgG) [12,13,14]. The absence of light chains in IgG and a lack of constant domain 1 (CH1) in the heavy chain are the key characteristics of heavy-chain antibodies (HC-Abs). Therefore, an antigen-binding site of HC-Abs is formed only by a single domain, which is linked directly via a hinge region to the Fc (fragment crystallizable) domain. HC-Abs recognize the antigen with only one special variable domain, referred to as VHH. The structure of the VHH domain resembles the VH IgG domain [15]. The complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of these HC-Abs possesses the extraordinary capacity to form long finger-like extensions, which can extend into cavities on antigens, as the CDR3 is often much longer than that of conventional VH domains [16,17]. Despite their small size (~15 kDa), sdAbs maintain affinities and antigen-binding specificities comparable to those of full-size mAbs [18]. Clear advantages include the ability to recognize hidden antigenic sites that are inaccessible for conventional antibodies due to their structure; stability over a wide range of temperatures and pH; high solubility, as well as economical and facile expression and production in large quantities in microorganisms [15,17]. Several studies were conducted to test the potency of VHHs as inhibitors of viral infections [18] and different toxins, produced by such plants and microorganisms as Ricinus communis [19], Mycoplasma hominis [20], Clostridium tetani [21], Clostridium difficile [22], Crotalus durissus terrificus [23], and Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) [24]. It has been demonstrated that the antigen-binding region of VHHs produced by camelids showed strong anti-BoNT activities in animal models [25,26]. Due to their unique features and high efficacy, sdAbs are currently in clinical phase trials for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, hematology, and respiratory diseases [27]. For instance, Cablivi is a nanobody-based medicine, which has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) treatment [28].",

Another approach was to generate virus vectors encoding chimeric proteins with one or more VHHs fused in frame to a cDNA encoding the red blood cell membrane proteins glycophorin A or Kell. In vitro studies and stem cell transplantation research has demonstrated that the half-life of these VHHs could be extended to several weeks with retained functionality [32]. The VHH could also be fused to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of an IgG. Such modifications, termed fusionbodies, increase the total protein complex size, as well as VHH-Fc interaction with neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), making it impossible to clear by the renal filtration system [30]. Furthermore, the attached Fc fragment can promote effector functions, such as phagocytosis and cytotoxicity, thereby enhancing the neutralization of pathogen entry and replication [33].",

One construction was a dimer form of each clone (B11-dimer and G3-dimer) held by a glycine-serine linker (Gly4Ser)3 and expressed in the pET30 plasmid. The second construction was a monomer of each clone linked to a human IgG Fc fragment (B11-Fc and G3-Fc) (Figure 4a). Fc-modifications have been used to increase the antibody circulation time in blood. Human Fc-fragments cross-react with murine Fc-receptors and are capable of binding mouse FcRn [35,36]. Human Fc was chosen for these constructions to be used in further research and clinics. The dimers were produced and purified from the bacterial periplasmic fraction and verified by SDS-PAGE to be ~30 kDa. VHHs fused with Fc fragments were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-S) cells and verified by SDS-PAGE to be ~40 kDa under reducing conditions (Figure 4b). To determine the polypeptide chain of the toxin that bound specific antibodies, it was denatured by DTT into its HC and LC. SDS-PAGE was performed in denaturing conditions followed by western blot. B11-Fc and G3-Fc clones were tested, and anti-human IgG (Fc-specific)-peroxidase antibodies (1:2500) were used as detection reagents (Figure 4c). These antibodies were associated with the HC (100 kDa) of the toxin, which corresponds to the receptor domain. An immunoblot with BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT (under reducing conditions) were performed as control (Figure 4d). We investigated the affinity of clones B11 and G3 via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Amine coupling was used to immobilize BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT on the sensor chip. The kinetic binding on- and off-rates between the antibodies and the toxin were determined from sensorgram analysis and used to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) (Table 1).",

The concentrations of G3, B11, as well as B11-dimer and G3-dimer, detected at 1 h post-injection were only about 10% of the initial level observed at 0 h. However, B11-Fc and G3-Fc modification constructs had a relatively long serum half-life. The concentrations of B11-Fc and G3-Fc 96 h post-injection were approximately 10% of the initial level. Moreover, two weeks after injection, the concentrations of B11-Fc and G3-Fc antibodies were approximately 1% of the initial level. These data are in agreement with reports on other VHHs with monomeric and fusionbody formats [37] (Figure 5b).",

In particular, it has been shown that HC-only antibodies or VHHs derived from HC-only antibodies, produced by camelids demonstrate strong anti-BoNT activities in animal models [6,43,44]. The main differences of VHHs from conventional antibodies include specific conserved amino acid substitutions in framework region 2 (FR2) that make contact with the LC of classical antibodies, as well as a longer length, more variable amino acid composition in the CDR3s, and a folded back loop [27,45,46]. Specific VHHs can be isolated from VHH libraries. One type of such libraries\u2014immune libraries\u2014can be produced based on peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from camelids that have been immunized with an antigen of interest in a prime-boost strategy [47]. In our study, we used a toxoid consisting of BoNT/A toxin and small amounts of hemagglutinin (HA) as an antigen and screened for VHHs against BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT using phage display technology.",

The approach of splitting the toxin into its HC and LC enriches the neutralizing clones in the library. Based on their neutralizing activity when pre-mixed with different toxin LD50 doses, two clones were selected.

Constructs with fused Fc fragments were previously made to extend the antibody half-life to neutralize the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [48,49], target the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) to prevent human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) strain entry and replication in vitro [50], and increase the Fc effector functions to neutralize rotavirus [51] as well as the influenza virus HA [52]. A recent study of modified VHHs dimers and VHHs fused to Fcs targeting unique epitopes on the immunogen, composed of a portion of the central delivery domain and the entire combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain of Clostridium difficile type B, showed modest and much greater toxin inhibitions, respectively [53]. It should be noted that a combined approach for efficient serum clearance of BoNT/A has been developed before. Sepulveda et al. [54] used single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) as protein binding agents pre-complexed with one or two single anti-tag mAbs with an Fc domain and tested this construction in vivo for protection and pharmacokinetics. When three or four types of such constructions were given simultaneously, mice were protected at high LD50s, and BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera. Protection against BoNT/A light chain was observed when scFvs fused with Fc fragments (scFv-Fc) obtained from a macaque immune library were tested ex vivo [55]. Furthermore, the substantial contribution of the homologous Fc fragment to the potency of three individual anti-botulinum mAbs in antibody preparations has been demonstrated [56].",

Blood was collected from the facial vein at 0, 1, 4, 24, 48, 96, 168, 240, 336 h time points. Sera were separated and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use. Concentrations of the injected antibody molecules in the above-collected samples were measured by ELISA. For ELISA, BoNT/A was coated on microtiter plates (Nunc) overnight at 4 \u00b0C at 100 ng/well in 50 mM bicarbonate buffer. After washing three times with TPBS, plates were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS for one hour at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 200\u00d7 diluted sera were added to the wells, followed by a one-hour incubation. Mouse anti-His-tag antibody [HRP] (1:1000) (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used to detect monomers and dimers of G3 and B11 antibodies in the mouse sera. Goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody [HRP] (1:2000) (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was used to detect G3-Fc and B11-Fc antibodies in the mouse sera.
