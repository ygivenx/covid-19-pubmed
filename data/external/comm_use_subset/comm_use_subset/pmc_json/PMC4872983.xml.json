            "text": "Disease management constitutes the ability to decrease costs of interventions within a specific population. In this type of study, the inexistence of a control group may lead to a series of bias and practical difficulties(1). The approach using time series analysis is an alternative in the evaluation of disease management programs. When a time series is analyzed, the variable observed depends on its previous period, presenting a dependable series. This feature assists investigators in identifying, explaining, and predicting the effects of management programs performed throughout time. Depending on the program, inclusion of patients may not be instantaneous varying with each case. Therefore, a program that includes participants followed-up for 3 to 6 months can perceive the first results only several months or years later(2). Because of the importance of \u201ctime\u201d for disease management studies, this review presents an analysis of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. This model is the most commonly used by time series health researchers(3\u20136). Time series models have greater ability of prediction and wide applicability than nontemporal techniques(7). Diffusing database use and data inclusion (eg, by using electronic medical records) creates an adequate environment for this methodology.",

Such model estimations enabled the hospital staff to predict 3 days ahead of time the number of beds that would be required during the epidemic. This study also commented on the viability of the ARIMA model for hospital bed planning and for other critical resources during epidemics of infectious diseases(8). Another study conducted in China(9) suggested the need for an adequate model to forecast, based on historical data, cases of hemorrhagic fever with kidney syndrome. Currently, China has 90% of cases of this disease reported globally, and the use of ARIMA models enables them to create better management and short-term predictions of the disease(9).",

It is important to mention that data in healthcare have a relative variability, and it is difficult to identify these patterns. A way to overcome this limitation is to evaluate the autocorrelation (ie, to evaluate how an observation is related to the prior observation). To convert these data to the stationary stage, the investigator creates a new series of data, based on the differences of the current period in relationship to the previous one. Series are considered stationary when autocorrelation does not show statistically significant results.",
