CCoV is a common infection in young dogs, particularly those housed in large groups [2\u20135]. CCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and it belongs to the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus-1 [6]. CCoV consists of two distinct genotypes, CCoV-I and CCoV-II; the CCoV-II viruses are further divided into two subtypes CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb [3, 7]. The S protein of CCoV is a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, and it plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion. Accumulating reports attributed that the increase in the severity of CCoV infections in dogs and the emergence of CCoV variants to potential recombination events within the S gene, which occur when a host is co-infected with different CCoV types [8\u201310]. Therefore, CCoV has received much attention as an emerging cause of infectious disease in dogs [4, 11\u201316].",

However, information about the epidemiology of CCoVs in China is not available in the past five years. In the current study, we conducted a molecular epidemiologic investigation of CCoV in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Moreover, the genetic evolution and co-infection of the identified CCoV strains were analyzed. Our aim was to provide insights into the epidemiology and genetic diversity of the CCoV strains circulating in northeast China.",

Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers (six nucleotides) using Moloney murine leukemia virus (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In this study, the EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (2\u00d7 Premix) (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), and the Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for PCR amplifications of all target genes. Other PCR amplification conditions were performed according to the protocols described by Pratelli et al. (2004) [23] and Erles and Brownlie (2009) [24]. The purified PCR products were directly subjected to Sanger sequencing, and each sample was sequenced three times. Sequence analysis was performed using the EditSeq program in the Lasergene DNASTAR\u2122 version 5.06 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).

Co-infections between CCoV and CPV-2 have been documented in dog populations in Western Europe, Japan, and Albania [32\u201334]. However, the high co-infection rate of CCoV with CaKV has not been reported in China and other countries. CaKV had been reported to be associated with severe enteritis in a litter of puppies [13]. It is speculated that the high prevalence of co-infections of CCoV with CaKV and CPV-2 may be associated with the occurrence of viral diarrhea in dogs in northeast China.

The high prevalence of CCoV in the feces of diarrheic dogs aged 2\u20134 months was partially validated in other studies [11, 32, 33]. The high positive rate (56.14%) of CCoV was found between October and December, which may be associated with seasonal variations in northeast China. At present, most dogs in northeast China are vaccinated for CPV-2, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 1, and canine adenovirus type 2. In our study, of the 57 CCoV-positive samples, the immunized and non-immunized animals accounted for 43.86% and 36.84%, respectively. This result demonstrated that vaccination for other canine viruses did not effect CCoV infections in the dog population in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Given the high prevalence and co-infection rates of CCoV, although it is controversial whether CCoV vaccines provide adequate immunity [35, 36], the immunization for CCoV is recommended in the dog population in northeast China in the future.",

To investigate single or multiple infections of CCoV types I, IIa, and IIb, we attempted to amplify three fragments of the S gene of 57 CCoV-positive samples by RT-PCR. Only the S genes of 28 CCoV strains were obtained, of which 26 strains belonged to CCoV-IIa, while the remaining two strains belonged to CCoV-I and CCoV-IIb, respectively. Compared with the reference strains, the partial S genes of the 26 Chinese CCoV-IIa strains exhibit genetic diversity, which is in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis of the M genes identified in our study. The CCoV-IIb strain HRB-BB9 was closely related to CCoV-IIb reference strains from Europe. The CCoV-I strain HRB-A4 clustered with reference strains from Europe, North America and South America. Additionally, it was rarely reported that one co-infection between CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb was found in the 28 CCoV-positive samples. The limited data demonstrated that CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa, and CCoV-IIb co-circulated in northeast China, and that CCoV-IIa strains predominated in the dog population.",

Resulting data increase our understanding of the evolution of CCoV strains circulating in northeast China, and they provide valuable epidemiological information for further studies of CCoV.
