            "text": "Avian respiratory tract infections are associated with massive economic losses particularly under poor intensive rearing conditions in winter seasons. Several pathogens, adverse environmental conditions and poor managemental factors are involved [1\u20133]. Pathogens include avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian pneumovirus (APV), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). Avian respiratory tract infections can be caused by single pathogens or in combination with each other in form of preceding, concurrent or secondary infections [3\u20135]. Change in the ecosystem of the respiratory microbiome [6], mechanical damage of the epithelium, loss of ciliated cells and the impairment of innate immune responses are a consequence of primary respiratory infections and associated with enhanced disease and economical losses during superinfections [7].",

Laboratory investigations revealed that IBV represents the most common pathogen detected during these outbreaks [8\u201310]. IB is a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, renal and reproductive tract of chickens. The disease caused by single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus belongs to the genus of Gamma coronavirus [11]. The spike (S) glycoprotein represents the major structural and immunogenic domain, and plays a pivotal role in tissue tropism and carry the receptor-binding site [12]. The S glycoprotein is cleaved post transitionary into S1 (globular head) and S2 (stalk) domain [13]. The S1 domain possesses three hypervariable regions (HVR 1, 2 and 3) responsible for the high genetic and antigenic variability of IBV [14]. Despite massive vaccination strategies used in Egypt, IBV extensively circulates in all over Egypt in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chickens with continuous viral evolution [9,15,16]. Complications between APEC and IBV infections are widely observed under field conditions and are reproduced under experimental conditions resulting in enhanced severe colibacillosis [7] and enhanced pathogenicity post IBV infection.",

Based on partial spike protein gene sequencing, all positive IBV samples were clustered within the Egyptian variant IBV that belongs to the GI-23 genotype [18].

Results obtained revealed a significant higher persistence of APEC and IBV shedding together with higher morbidity and mortality in the mixed infection group comparing to single infected groups. This finding agrees with several previous studies [29,42,43]. Mechanisms behind the escalation of pathogenicity after mixed IBV and APEC infections are not yet fully understood. However, alteration of the immune response is most likely the cause not mechanical altering of the mucociliary barrier [29]. Bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced the severity of single APEC O78 challenge as well as a mixed infection with APEC and IBV. In brief, a high dose of bacteriophages administered intratracheally reduced the morbidity, prevented mortalities and significantly decreased APEC shedding compared to non-treated APEC challenge. Local application of bacteriophages at the site of APEC infection that is relatively inaccessible via the circulatory system, i.e. intra air sac administration, enables bacteriophages to eliminate the disease [44]. This explains the success of intrathoracic air sac injections in the reduction or prevention of mortality in several studies [38,44]. In the present study with a higher bacteriophage dose and intra-tracheal inoculation, APEC was significantly reduced in the bacteriophage treated lung tissue. In the case of mixed infections, bacteriophage treatment did not only reduce bacterial counts but also significantly reduced IBV detected in the lung, and associated with reduction in morbidity and mortality in the mixed infection group but not the single IBV infected group. These results show the efficient inhibition of APEC replication associated with a reduction of IBV severity during mixed infections.",
