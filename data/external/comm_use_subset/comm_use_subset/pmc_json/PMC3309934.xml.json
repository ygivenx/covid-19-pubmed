The viruses, such as enterovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus, were most often isolated from the pediatric outpatients [1]. Adenovirus causes acute respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years old. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common causative pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children and young adults. In Taiwan, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was reported to account for 20\u201330% of CAP cases [2], [3]. Airborne viruses are known to be associated with larger particles and aggregate in nature [4]. Most aerosolized droplet nuclei are between 0.58 and 5.42 \u00b5m in diameter [5]. One investigation found 53% of detectable influenza virus particles in the respiratory aerosol fraction (1\u20134 \u00b5m) [6].",

Previous studies have found that sampling devices such as the all-glass impinger 30, the SKC BioSampler and a frit bubbler are unsuited to collect viral particles [8]. Filtration was used to collect airborne particles that contain viruses, including rhinovirus [9], [10], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [11]\u2013[13], RSV [14], enterovirus, adenovirus, and influenza A virus [15]. PCR analysis amplifies nucleic acids exponentially, and is particularly sensitive to airborne infectious agents, such as rhinovirus [9], [10], RSV [14], enterovirus, adenovirus, influenza A virus [15], SARS coronavirus [11]\u2013[13], and measles virus [16].

The detection rate of airborne adenovirus DNA products in the pediatric emergency room clearly exceeded those of Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products. Airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products were detected in around 46% of samples from the pediatric outpatient department of the hospital. The distribution of microbial species in the pediatric public areas warrants further attention from the department of environmental safety and health to reduce the risk of microbial exposure in humans. The possibility of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae that transmitted by the airborne route also warrants further investigation.",

Furthermore, airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae were frequently detected in the pediatric outpatient department and the detection rates were highest in autumn and winter seasons. This results suggest that the ventilation rate in pediatric public areas (including the emergency room and outpatient department) of hospitals should be increased during the peak seasons of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae contamination to reduce the airborne bioaerosol levels. The limitation of this study was lack of environmental characteristics measurement along with airborne adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae sampling. Further study will enable the relationship between indoor environmental characteristics (including temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration) and the airborne adenovirus/Mycoplasma pneumoniae to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The air sampling time in the pediatric outpatient department was shorter than that in the pediatric emergency room. The main reason was that the pediatric outpatient department of the hospital was close at nighttime. The monthly detection rate of airborne adenovirus DNA products in the filter samples in the pediatric outpatient department was lower than that in the pediatric emergency room, but the measured viral concentrations in March, May, June, and July in the pediatric outpatient department considerably exceeded those measured in the pediatric emergency room. Additionally, Mycoplasma pneumoniae exhibited not only a higher detection rate but also higher concentrations in the pediatric outpatient department than in the pediatric emergency room. The possible cause may be the indoor unfair ventilation and more patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the pediatric outpatient department. The results demonstrate that the mean CO2 concentration in the pediatric outpatient department exceeded that in the pediatric emergency room. Therefore, the ventilation system should be adjusted periodically and the air change rate should be increased during peak seasons with high viral concentrations in the pediatric public areas. Also, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters should perhaps be installed in the ventilation systems in the pediatric public areas of hospitals to maintain indoor air quality. In addition, the results indicated that monthly distributions of detection rates of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the air samples were inconsistent with the median concentration distributions of airborne adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the pediatric public areas. The possible reason might be included: 1) the air samples in the pediatric public areas were only collected twice in a week; 2) the exact number of infected patients in the pediatric public areas was unknown.",

Tseng et al. study indicated that the influenza A virus concentrations in the air were significantly correlated with the number of patients with low respiratory tract infections (r = 0.43, p = 0.02), but no correlation occurred between the viral concentrations and the number of patients with upper respiratory tract infections (r = 0.33, p = 0.06) [15]. During the study period, there was not outbreak occurrence of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in the hospital. There were a great number of patients and visitors in the hospital, and not all of patients with respiratory tract infection were tested for adenovirus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, so it would be underestimated the number of patients with adenovirus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the pediatric public areas. The relationship between the number of infected patients and the number of air samples with detected certain pathogens warrants further investigation.",

The quality of indoor air depends on heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the number of persons, human activity and other factors (i.e., the outdoor air quality) [19], [20]. Until recently, no standard method had been established for detecting specific viral aerosol particles. Tolerable levels of airborne viruses in hospitals have not yet been established. Airborne particle concentration has been suggested to be an indicator of microbial contamination [21]. In this study, PM10 and PM1 levels were higher in the pediatric outpatient department than in the pediatric emergency room. Hence, further investigations must be performed to characterize the relationship between particulate matter levels, such as PM10 and PM1, and the concentrations of airborne viruses and bacteria.",
