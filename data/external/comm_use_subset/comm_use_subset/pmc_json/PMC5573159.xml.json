B2 haplotype chickens are more resistant to avian coronavirus infection than B19 haplotypes and these differences in disease resistance were observed early after infection in our previous studies [10]. This suggests that innate immunity plays a major role with the macrophage being a key player in this enhanced immune response as evidenced by the B2 haplotype birds\u2019 greater capability to produce nitric oxide (NO) in response to IFN\u03b3 and Poly I:C [13]. In addition, B2 macrophages activated T cells more efficiently than macrophages derived from B19 haplotypes [14].",

In addition, macrophages release cytokines activating other immune cells and antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immune response [21\u201323]. It has become increasingly clear that dysregulation of macrophage function is involved in inflammatory disease processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer [24\u201326]. Involved in these interactions are crucial molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize invading microorganisms, resulting in communication with the adaptive immune system such as increased expression of MHC surface molecules, T cell receptors and secreted cytokines [21,23]. Genetic differences in any of those molecules can potentially account for differences in immune competence and thus provide potential immunogenetic markers for disease resistance to various pathogens.",

Next, Cufflinks was employed to estimate transcript specific expression levels across the transcripts and genes within the reference genome based on the number of sequence reads for each mRNA. The sequence read data was normalized using the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) method to more accurately determine expression levels.

At day t-6, after plating of monocytes without interferon stimulation, several genes relating to inflammation, interferon responses and differentiation are upregulated in the B2 haplotype. This is to be expected as adherence of the monocytes is actually an activation signal, but it is notable that this signal is not resulting in the same gene expression pattern in the B19 haplotype. This pattern can be observed for genes such as IL1\u03b2, PTSG2, IL6, which are mainly associated with the inflammatory M1 phenotype. On the other hand, Adenosine receptor A2B is also showing increased gene expression at this time in B2 cells, and this receptor plays an important role in differentiation, as well as in the inflammatory response. Expressions of these genes are consequently initially increased at the time of adherence, and then again after stimulation with interferon, in the B2 haplotype. Some, but not all of these genes are expressed after stimulation with interferon in the B19 haplotype, but not to the same extent as the B2 macrophages, which appears to relate to the initial lack of expression at t-6 days, the beginning of differentiation.",

This seems to indicate a lack of appropriate regulation in the B19 birds, consequently leading to less coherent initiation of gene expression when stimulated. Some of the genes showing this pattern are macrophage differentiation associated GATA2 and FADD, as well as macrophage podosome markers VCL and GSN. Taken together, these results appear to suggest that the regulation of B2 differentiation from monocyte to macrophage is very tightly regulated with many genes increasing in expression, quickly followed by shutting down this increased gene expression. In contrast, the regulation of B19 gene expression is not well regulated, appearing to \u201clinger\u201d with either delayed or extended gene expression. Consequently, we observed differences in expression of genes after stimulation with interferon. Specifically, genes that were strongly expressed at day t-6 and not expressed (or only weakly expressed) at day t-3 in the B2 birds, were robustly increased at 2 and 4 hours of stimulation. In contrast, the same genes showed weak and delayed expression in B19 birds after stimulation, emphasizing the importance of the regulation of gene expression during differentiation. This relates very well to the differences we previously reported in morphology of B2 and B19 macrophages during differentiation and after stimulation.",
