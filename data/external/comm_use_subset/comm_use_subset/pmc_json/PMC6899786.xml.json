Similar to other large mammals, the earliest\u2010known ancestors of the camelid family, Protylopus, originated in the North American savannah during the Eocene (~45 Ma), with a size smaller than a goat. At least 20 genera of camelids, e.g. Megacamelus and Procamelus, developed and disappeared again over the following million years (Honey et al. 1998; Rybczynski et al. 2013), until the ancestors of Old World camels reached Eurasia via the Bering land bridge around 6.5\u20137.5 Mya. Fossils of Paracamelus and other giant camels have been recorded in Asia (Kozhamkulova 1986; Flynn 1997), Europe (e.g. Spain; Pickford et al. 1995), Northern Africa (Camelus thomasi; Peters 1998) and the Arabian Peninsula (e.g. Syria; Martini et al. 2015). The progenitors of the New World camels entered South America around 3 Mya (Prothero & Schoch 2002; Rybczynski et al. 2013). Figure 1 presents an early migration map of camels.",

Nowadays their range has become severely reduced to only four locations worldwide: three in China (Taklamakan desert, Gashun Gobi desert and Arjin Mountains in the Lop Nur Lake region) and one in Mongolia (Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area \u2018A\u2019). These are now the last refuges for wild camels, which are listed as Critically Endangered (Hare 2008), as estimates for the numbers of remaining animals range from 1000 to 1600 (Lei et al. 2012; Yadamsuren et al. 2012). The genetic status of C. ferus has been heavily debated, as morphological similarities with its domestic counterpart led to the assumption that wild camels were merely the descendants of domestic animals that had returned to the wild (Peters & von den Driesch 1997). However, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (2003) fixed the first available specific name based on a wild population \u2018C. ferus\u2019 to the wild camel (Gentry et al. 2004), and genetic studies (Ji et al. 2009; Silbermayr et al. 2010; Jirimutu et al. 2012; Mohandesan et al. 2017; Yi et al. 2017) confirmed that the wild two\u2010humped camel is an original wild form and separate species C. ferus.",

The regions of domestication, however, are still a matter of debate, with two hypotheses presently being discussed: HI, domestication took place in northeastern Iran and the adjacent Kopet Dagh foothills in southwestern Turkmenistan, part of the historical region \u2018Bactria\u2019, which was eponymous for domestic two\u2010humped camels (Beneke 1994); and HII, a centre of domestication was further to the east where people were familiar with wild camels over an extended period of time, e.g. in Kazakhstan or northwestern Mongolia. The lack of wild camel remains in the Neolithic strata of the Kopet Dagh foothills led to the assumption that fully domesticated two\u2010humped camels were acquired from eastern Asia (Peters & von den Driesch 1997). Both hypotheses still need to be tested using ancient DNA analyses of wild and early\u2010domestic two\u2010humped camel samples. A preliminary palaeogenetic analysis of 12 Bactrian camel bones from Late Bronze and Early Iron Age sites in Uzbekistan and Siberia showed the same mitochondrial haplotypes as described in modern domestic Bactrian camels, suggesting a single domestication process (Trinks et al. 2012). A significantly higher genetic diversity detected in the genomes of Iranian camels could hint of an ancient origin of domestic Bactrian camels from this region (Jirimutu & Ming 2018), supporting hypothesis HI. However, post\u2010domesticated cross\u2010species hybridisation with dromedaries would have left similar signals in the genomes and thus cannot be ruled out. Movements of domestic camels or multiple origins of the founder populations also could have led to the observed higher diversity in Iranian camels.",

            "text": "Based on osteological and pictorial evidence as well as cultural context, the domestication of dromedaries probably happened in the late second millennium (1100\u20131800) BCE (Uerpmann & Uerpmann 2002; von den Driesch & Obermaier 2007; Iamoni 2009 and Grigson 2012, 2014; Uerpmann & Uerpman 2012; Magee 2015). Mitochondrial, nuclear and ancient DNA analyses of a global dataset of modern individuals and up to 7000\u2010year\u2010old wild dromedary samples revealed shared ancestry between wild dromedaries from the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula and modern animals (Fig. 2). A minimum of six wild maternal lineages were captured during the process of domestication with the most frequent mitochondrial haplotype still present in approximately 70% of the worldwide dromedary population. This can be explained by a \u2018restocking from the wild\u2019 scenario, with an initial domestication followed by introgression from individuals from wild, now\u2010extinct populations (Almathen et al. 2016). As suggested by the environmental context in which wild dromedaries would have evolved, i.e. foraging in coastal habitats (Peters 1998), their native distribution and population size were restricted compared with the ancestors of other livestock species. A sudden population decline around 6000\u20138000 ya (Almathen et al. 2016) indicates that, by the time cultural control over the wild one\u2010humped dromedary was initiated, its populations may already have become increasingly disjointed owing to anthropogenic activities, until they disappeared ca. 2000 ya (Uerpmann & Uerpmann 2002; von den Driesch & Obermaier 2007; Uerpmann & Uerpman 2012; Grigson 2014).",

Larger herds in northern Africa appeared only during the fourth to seventh centuries CE (Late Antiquity/Early Middle Ages), where their adoption into local economies may have been slow (Bulliet 1975; Midant\u2010Reynes & Braunstein\u2010Silvestre 1977). Another possible route for dromedary introduction into Africa might have involved a transfer from the south of the Arabian Peninsula by boat via the Gulf of Aden to Eastern Africa or further north across the Red Sea to Egypt (Fig. 3). The southern sea route is supported by socio\u2010ethological observations, as today's Eastern African dromedaries are used largely for milk production rather than for riding and transportation, and this could be rooted in practices associated with the early stages of dromedary husbandry on the southern Arabian Peninsula (Bulliet 1975; Grigson 2012).",

The traditional usage of dromedaries as pack animals, their exchange and movements along transcontinental caravan routes might account for the observed lack of global population structure. The most contemporary migration route started in the 1860s and linked the Indian Subcontinent to Australia, where several thousand camels were imported until the 1920s for the development of the Australian outback (Faye et al. 2004; Rangan & Kull 2010).

In Old World camelids hybridisation between Bactrian camels (C. bactrianus) and dromedaries (C. dromedarius) was associated with the transportation of goods along multiple long\u2010distance trade routes. This practice intended to produce animals with the robustness of the Bactrian camel, the endurance of the dromedary and an ability to tolerate sharply contrasting climatic conditions. The history of anthropogenic hybridisation is currently being investigated using archaeozoological and palaeogenetic techniques (http://www.hybridcamels.com). Preliminary results revealed hybrids from a Roman archaeological site in Serbia, Viminacium, dated to approximately the late third to fourth centuries CE (Burger et al. 2018). A complete camel skeleton from the seventeenth century CE excavated close to the river Danube in Austria attests to the usage of dromedary\u2013Bactrian camel crosses during the second Osmanic\u2013Habsburg war, as troops besieged Vienna (Galik et al. 2015).",

This improvement in physical performance and other (behavioural) traits, termed heterosis or hybrid vigour, arises from allelic interactions between parental genomes, potentially leading to increased growth, productivity and fitness of the fertile F1 hybrids. Hybrids of the second generation (F2), which are crosses between F1 hybrids (Jarbai), in Old World camels are usually not favoured because of their difficult character and weak progeny performance (Faye & Konuspayeva 2012). In western regions of Turkey, a much relished sport is camel wrestling, where prized male Tulus are entred into heavily regulated fights (\u00c7ak\u0131rlar & Berthon 2014; Manav et al. 2018; Fig. 4a).",

The latest surveys have revealed a reduction to only 900\u20131600 animals worldwide (Yadamsuren et al. 2019, Lei et al. 2012) . The remaining population is surrounded by an estimated number of 10 000 domestic camels, in addition to 50\u201360 already existing fertile hybrid camels in the circumjacent settlements. In some cases, the hybridisation of domestic females with wild bulls is initiated to enhance the fitness of domestic camels (Yadamsuren et al. 2012). The extensive livestock\u2013wildlife interface around the Great Gobi Special Protected Area \u2018A\u2019 is of particular concern for the conservation of the Mongolian wild camels. The movement of domesticated animals into the habitat of the wild population leads to the transfer of potential pathogens across this domestic\u2013wildlife interface (Walzer et al. 2012). Introgression of domestic Bactrian camel genes into wild camels has been demonstrated in mitochondrial (Silbermayr et al. 2010) and nuclear DNA (Silbermayr & Burger 2012) as well as the Y\u2010chromosome (Felkel et al. 2019).",

The increased interest in camel milk in a more urbanised world has boosted research activities on dairy camel selection (Faye 2018). Studies have mainly focused on udder morphology (Ayadi et al. 2016), management in intensive systems (Nagy & Juhasz 2016) and the assessment of (non\u2010)genetic factors for milk composition (Nagy et al. 2017). Despite the lack of selection pressure for dairy yield in camels, a rough classification into three groups was suggested. (Alhadrami & Faye 2016) The first group is the high\u2010producing dairy camels with an annual milk production of more than 3000 l are characterised by a large body size (up to 2.40 m at withers) with developed abdomen, large hump, prominent mammary vein and an overall well\u2010developed udder (Fig. 4b; Table 2). In the second group are medium producers ranging between 1500 and 3000 l are usually dual\u2010purpose animals (milk and meat or packing/riding) with medium body and hump sizes (Fig. 4c). Such animals are common in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but also in Sahelian countries (Table 2). Their milk production improvement is less sensitive to feeding supplementation, as these animals have the tendency to accumulate fat in their hump rather than producing more milk. Their coat colour is usually light, contrary to the former group, in which the hair is darker. The third group contains the low producers with less than 1500 l of milk, including the Bactrian camel and dromedaries used for other purposes than milking, thus their udder is not well developed.",

Indeed, the lack of standardised recording methods and lactation lengths, together with the heterogeneity of the farming system, especially in extensive management, has hampered a comprehensive analysis of the dromedary milk production potential on a global scale (Faye 2008). Recently, Nagy et al. (2017) monitored the changes in milk gross chemical composition of individual dromedaries representing seven different populations over a 5\u2010year period, showing a strong influence of the respective dromedary types on all parameters. Furthermore, the milking performance of three Saudi dromedary types managed under the same conditions during a 10\u2010month lactation period showed that camels achieved peak yields at the fourth month of lactation, whereas the total lactation yield and milk composition varied among the three populations (Gaili et al. 2000).",

Overall, milk whey proteins were reported to display a wide range of bioactivities including immune modulating, antibacterial and antifungal activities (reviewed in Mati et al. 2017). In relation to milk production, oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. The novel characterisation and re\u2010sequencing of the 825 and 811 bp long OXT gene in dromedaries and Bactrian camels showed one and two polymorphisms in the intron regions of this gene, respectively.

The latest study on pregnancy and parturition in over 2100 dromedaries from six different breeds/ecotypes showed that the season (month of the year) and the female camel (not the breed) were the most important determinants of variation in gestation length and calf birth weight. Seasonal changes were independent of nutritional factors but associated with climatic conditions, e.g. the photoperiod (Nagy & Juhasz 2019). Assisted reproduction technologies are mainly practiced in racing dromedaries, as newly developed techniques are labour\u2010 and cost\u2010intensive.
