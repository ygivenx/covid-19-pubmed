IFN\u03b3 induces the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine14,15. By depleting tryptophan, IDO1 activation curtails the growth of C. trachomatis, which is a tryptophan auxotroph16. Under conditions of limited tryptophan availability, the chlamydial life-cycle deviates from normal development to form an aberrant, viable but non-cultivable, growth form termed persistence17,18. Renewal of tryptophan availability can reactivate persistent forms to return to normal development19. However, when initial levels of tryptophan are already limiting, IFN\u03b3 exposure can block all development, including the onset of persistence20. Curiously, although IFN\u03b3 inhibits the growth of C. trachomatis in cells that are pre-depleted of tryptophan in vitro, the developmental cycle of C. trachomatis serovar D exhibits a moderate resistance to the effects of IFN\u03b3 if the cytokine is added at the time of infection21,22. Consistent with the latter observations, clinical observations indicate the presence of active C. trachomatis infections within the infected endocervix despite the presence of higher than normal levels of IFN\u03b3 in the infected microenvironment23. Therefore, we wondered if C. trachomatis had a mechanism by which it could attenuate the effects of IFN\u03b3 secreted by immune cells in response to a primary infection.",

It is likely these protective effects rely on the prevention of secondary infections. This is evidenced by multiple studies indicating that pre-treatment of host cells with interferons blocks the subsequent replication of a pathogen, even if it possesses effectors to evade such responses33,34. Therefore, while pathogens may circumvent the effects of interferons during primary infection, infection spread may be limited by the effects of interferons on uninfected bystander cells in the infected microenvironment. These observations may be relevant to chlamydial infections in vivo. Histological evidence from infected human tissues revealed a small number of infected cells to be surrounded by large numbers of uninfected-bystander cells35,36. Therefore, even if C. trachomatis possesses a mechanism to block the effect of IFN\u03b3 on an ongoing primary infection, the effects of the cytokine on bystander cells would block infection spread, consistent with overwhelming evidence that IFN\u03b3 is critical to control chlamydial infections in vivo.",

Punctate FITC signal, presumed to be EBs, were observed around the periphery of A2EN cells by one-hour post infection (hpi). By 36 hpi, inclusions with internal and peripheral FITC signal were observed. Pertinently, by this time, no fluorescent signal was observed at the cell periphery of infected or uninfected cells (Supporting Information Figure S1).

Similar results were obtained when cells were stained for chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (data not shown). A growth curve after infection using labeled EBs was performed to quantify IFU recovery between 12-72 hpi (Fig. 1D). The results indicated that infections initiated using labeled EBs developed at the same rate as control infections (ibid).

Pre-treatment of epithelial cells with IFN\u03b3 at low concentrations results in tryptophan depletion and the induction of persistent chlamydial growth forms17. While characterizing the effect of IFN\u03b3 on chlamydial growth in A2EN cells at 38 hpi, it was observed to not substantially impair infection or normal development if it was added at the time of infection (Fig. 2A,B). Consistent with these observations, IFU recovery 48 hpi after infection of A2EN cells indicated a modest decrease when IFN\u03b3 was added at the time of infection (Fig. 2D). In contrast, no recoverable IFUs were obtained at 48 hpi when A2EN cells were pre-treated with IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 2C,D). These observations are consistent with published reports that C. trachomatis serovar D infections of HeLa cells are moderately resistant to the effects of IFN\u03b321. Therefore, we considered it possible that C. trachomatis interfered with the induction of IDO1 by IFN\u03b3, or with IDO1 function. This hypothesis was explored by using the CPP to isolate pure populations of live infected and bystander cells after culture in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b3.",

Such differences between bystander and infected cells are not unique to the IFN\u03b3 response. Previous studies examining cell surface proteins indicated that the NK cell ligand, MIC-A, is upregulated on infected but not bystander cells52. Therefore, while we have used it to probe responses to IFN\u03b3, our approach will be of general utility to discern differences between infected and bystander cells. Currently, studies requiring a pool of mostly-infected cells rely on infections performed with an m.o.i that is sufficiently high to infect the majority of cells exposed to Chlamydia. Indeed, our finding that the IFN\u03b3-induced expression of IDO1 is suppressed within infected cells was confirmed using conditions in which >95% of Chlamydia-exposed cells were infected. This suppression was not observed when only 25% of cells in the exposed pool were infected. Although infections using high m.o.i have been informative, they do not reveal the contributions of bystander cells toward host defenses against infection.

A single cell analysis to evaluate the NF\u03baB-dependent induction of IL-8 after infection by Shigella flexneri uncovered dramatic differences between infected and bystander cells54. Although the NF\u03baB-dependent induction of IL-8 was downmodulated in Shigella infected cells, NF\u03baB activation and IL-8 expression were amplified in uninfected bystander cells (ibid). Protective immune responses dependent on bystander cells have also been described for the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium (ibid). While they differ mechanistically, these findings coincide with our observations that the effect of IFN\u03b3 on bystander cells limits the spread of a primary Chlamydia infection in vitro. Bystander cells are also likely to mediate proinflammatory responses associated with C. trachomatis pathology. Paradoxically, although there is strong evidence that NF\u03baB responses are inhibited in Chlamydia-infected cells in vitro4,5,55, animal and human studies indicate that a proinflammatory response is a hallmark of C. trachomatis pathogenesis [reviewed in56]. Akin to S. flexneri, bystander cells in the C. trachomatis-infected microenvironment may drive this proinflammatory response. From a broader perspective, studies with multiple intracellular pathogens emphasize the need to elucidate bystander cell contributions to infection dynamics and outcomes. The method we have developed to isolate live infected and bystander cells provides a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms by which bystander cells modulate the Chlamydia infection microenvironment.",

The observation that NF\u03baB-dependent transcriptional responses are downmodulated within infected cells was previously attributed to its cleavage by the chlamydial CPAF5 and/or TSP proteases4. Recent studies in which infected cell extracts were prepared under conditions where CPAF was inactive during cell lysis indicated that the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB is not cleaved by a chlamydial protease within intact cells57. Therefore, although NF\u03baB activity is reduced within infected cells, this reduction can no longer be attributed to its cleavage by a chlamydial protease. A reduction in NF\u03baB activity would also be observed if the capacity of Chlamydia to block nuclear accumulation of activated STAT1 extended to NF\u03baB. A possible block to NF\u03baB nuclear import in Chlamydia-infected cells is not without precedent. Enteropathogenic E. coli and Shigella secrete T3 effectors that prevent the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB58.",

The inhibitory mechanisms used by these pathogens fall into four broad categories. The first involves downmodulation of IFNGR, which renders Listeria monocytogenes-infected macrophages refractory to IFN\u03b325; The second uses STAT1 degradation as exhibited by Leishmania donovani41. The third category, inhibition of STAT1 activation, is used by Chikungunya virus26. The fourth involves the inhibition of activated STAT1 nuclear import and can be seen in infections by Ebola virus28, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus30 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus32. The Ebola virus expressed protein, VP24, binds the same domain of KPNA1 as STAT1. Association of VP24 with KPNA1 displaces STAT1, thereby preventing its nuclear localization28. The Nsp1b protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus disrupts STAT1 nuclear localization by degrading KPNA130. The ORF6 protein of the SARS coronavirus inhibits STAT1 nuclear localization by a mechanism that has not been completely elucidated. ORF6 sequesters karyopherin \u03b12 and it is proposed that sequestration affects the cellular environment necessary for KPNA1 function32.",

These images were deconvolved using AxioVision\u2019s Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Thresholding was used to delineate the circumference of each nucleus. Using 10 cells, the average cell depth was estimated to be 7.4 microns in the area corresponding to the nuclear circumference. Non-thresholded stacks of the 10 nuclei indicated the average nucleus height to be 6.1 microns. After determining these values, all images were acquired as stacks containing 35 z-sections spaced 0.2 microns apart. Acquired images were processed using Fiji (ImageJ)64. Image stacks for each channel were deconvolved using emission wavelength-specific theoretical point spread functions (PSFs) that were generated using the ImageJ plugin, PSF Generator65. The Landweber deconvolution algorithm implemented in the Image J plugin DeconvolutionLab was used for deconvolution66. Thirty-five positively-constrained iterations of deconvolution were performed with no early stopping criteria.",
