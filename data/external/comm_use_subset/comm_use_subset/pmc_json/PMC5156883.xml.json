MP infection is thought to influence the expression of associated proteins, which are released into the bloodstream through different pathways (Covani et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Li et al., 2014). Plasma proteins including cytokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and other soluble mediators are essential for MP infection. In terms of pediatric MPP diagnosis, culture and serological tests are insensitive, time-consuming, and cross-reactive in children (Daxboeck et al., 2003; Long et al., 2012); therefore, they are not appropriate for the rapid and accurate detection of MP infection in clinical practice.",

Recently, advances in high-throughput technologies, such as proteomics, have made the analysis of plasma proteins possible (Li et al., 2014). Proteomic analysis using a label-free protocol is increasingly being performed for biomarker selection. Based on the principle that a special mixture of plasma proteins present different characterizations, this technique has been widely used in many diseases including infectious diseases (Papadopoulos et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2004; Agranoff et al., 2006; Hodgetts et al., 2007), cancer (Engwegen et al., 2006), and vascular disease (Pinet et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2009). Although many protein biomarkers of MPP have been indicated by proteomics, specific proteins that can be used to discriminate MPP from other infection diseases, especially in children, have not been fully elucidated.",

However, ELISA showed that only the levels of SERPINA3, APOC1, and CFLAR were significantly different among all three groups and their ratios were consistent with the trends of the proteomics analyses. Using the same optimal cutoffs for each protein, we analyzed the sensitivities and specificities of different combinations of two or three of the different proteins for the diagnosis of MPP. The specificities of combined proteins were generally higher than APOC1, while the sensitivities of combined proteins were generally lower than the best protein for differentiating MPP patients and HC or IDC patients. In summary, our results showed that APOC1 alone was the best choice for differentiate of MPP in children. APOC1 had the best sensitivity and specificity. To the best of our knowledge, the sensitivity and specificity of the MP-specific antigens currently used are poor when used as a diagnostic test based on ineffective antibody detection (Zhang et al., 2014). Li et al. (2014) used label-free quantitative proteomics to demonstrate that IL-33 production in A549 cells was increased when they were infected with MP.

            "text": "MP is a unique cell wall deficient and cholesterol requiring bacteria (Berb\u00e9e et al., 2005; Ko et al., 2014). Cholesterol metabolism is essential for MP growth and infection. APOC1 is a 6.6-kDa plasma protein that inhibits receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance (Shulman et al., 1975). It is secreted by many organs, including the liver, spleen, and lung, and is secreted into the blood (Lauer et al., 1988). Therefore, the plasma level of APOC1 is associated with cholesterol metabolism and MP infection status in humans. Lipid metabolism is one of the essential changes in many infectious diseases, including MPP (Katsel et al., 2007; Xiang et al., 2007). Furthermore, many cholesterol metabolites have been analyzed by studies with the aim of screening and identifying early biomarkers for infectious disease (Leoni et al., 2006; Bach et al., 2009; Gilch et al., 2009). Several genes associated with cholesterol metabolism and lipid biosynthesis were reported to be up-regulated in serum or plasma (Brown et al., 2005). Because APOC1 activates cholesterol metabolism (Barbisin et al., 2014), its up-regulation leads to an increase in cholesterol biosynthesis, consistent with the concomitant presence of MP infectious disease.",
