There were 43 proteins in total (including different splice variants of GP gene) from the five ebolaviruses. Further, all the possible 9mer peptides from each protein were predicted for their immunological potential. One of the challenges in vaccine development is to avoid self-tolerance as the body\u2019s immune system rarely acts against self-antigens. Thus, all those 9mers that are available in the human body (or human genome) were removed. In order to achieve this goal, we removed all those viral patterns that are 100% identical to any pattern found in human thousand proteomes. Human thousand proteomes were created by using 1000 Genomes data and translating it to proteins sequences2526. This led us to the 9mer peptide/pattern that is found in this virus but absent in human proteomes. In order to develop an effective vaccine against a wide range of species, it is important to identify conserved patterns across the different species of Ebola. Therefore, this study involves the identification of unique patterns of 9mer peptides along with the frequency of their occurrence across different ebolaviruses. Also, a high priority was given to a pattern, which was common in the most number of ebolaviruses, which led to patterns/peptides of size of 9 residues that were conserved among ebolaviruses.",

The major role of the MHC is to bind to antigenic regions (or peptides) and present these peptides on the cell surface, where appropriate T-cells recognize these peptides. Thus, it is important to predict MHC binders, as these binders have the ability to activate the T-cells of the immune system. In this study, we have used ProPred1 with top 4% cutoff (default) for predicting MHC Class I binders29. ProPred1 is a matrix-based program, which predicts the peptide binding potential for 47 MHC Class I alleles. These binders may activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), so we may call these binders as potential CTL epitopes, which were predicted using CTLPred with default parameters. Similarly, to predict potential T-helper epitopes, we predicted MHC Class II binders in the above conserved peptides. The prediction of MHC Class II binders was performed using ProPred30 with top 3% threshold as suggested by the authors of ProPred. It is a quantitative/virtual matrix-based method that allows the users to predict promiscuous MHC Class II binders for 51 alleles.",

CTLPred is a direct method that predicts T-cell epitopes (CTL) from a primary sequence of the antigen instead of using the intermediate step where MHC Class I binders are predicted. CTLPred has a number of modules (e.g., ANN, SVM) for predicting CTL epitopes; in this study we have used SVM-based module with default parameters. In the past, numerous methods have been developed for predicting MHC Class II binders but none of them has been able to predict the type of interleukins released by these binders. In this study, we have used a method, IFNepitope with a default threshold of 0.0 to predict the antigenic region or MHC binders that can activate Th1 cells (T-helper cell type I)32 responsible for releasing interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). In brief, we predicted IFN-\u03b3 inducing peptides in Ebola antigens using IFNepitope. Similarly, we also predicted antigenic regions that can activate Th2 cells responsible for releasing of cytokine, interleukin-4 (IL4). In this study, we used IL4pred, at a default threshold of 0.2, for predicting the IL4-inducing antigenic regions or peptides in Ebola antigens33.",

Next, we identified 19mers, which were present in human genome in order to eliminate off-target interaction. Finally, we selected all those siRNAs, which may silence targets gene with efficacy more than a value of 0.80. We wanted to identify promiscuous siRNA that could target all five ebolaviruses. Unfortunately, we did not find a single common 19mer oligonucleotide in any of the five ebolaviruses (Figure S7). The distribution of siRNAs selected against Ebola across the five ebolaviruses at gene level has been shown in Fig. 4. The distribution of potential siRNAs against each target gene in ebolaviruses is shown in Table 4 and the number of siRNAs targeting common ebolaviruses is enlisted in Supplementary Table S2. Our server shows potential siRNAs against target genes in the form of tables with the Circos plots40 for visualization. Users can get detailed information like strain ID, gene, siRNA sequence, cognate mRNA sequence, starting position and efficacy from our website.

In this study, we made an attempt to analyze the conserved epitopes so that the resulting vaccine covers a broad range of species, sequenced till date. Besides conservation, immune response is the next challenge to be addressed by the vaccine candidates. We have predicted diverse kinds of immune responses for better efficacy of the candidates. In the past, computational studies have been carried out for designing vaccines against viruses4445. But these studies were limited in terms of the number of proteins covered and the types of immune responses considered464748. We have observed the peptides (9mers) that are capable of stimulating different kinds of immunity. In the current study, we have uncovered 123 conserved peptides among all the human pathogenic ebolavirus that can activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In addition to CTL activation, we have also identified 42 peptides that can activate the T helper response after binding with MHC class II. We have also eliminated the peptides that could share sequence identity with the human proteome to avoid any cross-reaction of vaccine candidates with human proteins. We are hopeful that these vaccine candidates will provide better immunity and lead to a successful vaccine in the future. We have also discovered 45 conserved peptides that were able to trigger B-cell response to generate antibody among all the human pathogenic subtypes of the Ebola virus. These peptides could serve in the diagnosis of the Ebola virus.",
