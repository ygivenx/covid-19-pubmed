            "text": "Since the coincidental isolation of Seneca Valley virus (SVV), recently termed Senecavirus A (SV-A) [1], as a cell culture media contaminant in 2002, a number of serologically similar viruses were identified and grouped to the classification of Senecavirus [2]. The primary sequence analysis of the conserved polypeptide regions (P1, 2C, 3C and 3D) of the first isolate (SVV-001) showed that the virus is most closely related to cardioviruses in the family of Picornaviridae [2]. The single-stranded RNA genome of SV-A displays the secondary structural features of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that resembles the IRES element of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) of the family Flaviviridae, giving rise to the possibility that genetic exchange may have occurred between members of Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae during persistent co-infection in pigs [3]. Importantly, SV-A is a natural oncolytic agent, with the ability to selectively replicate in; and kill human tumor cells of neuroendocrine origin, thus, the virus is being advanced as a tool for potential therapeutic intervention of cancer [4].",

            "text": "Swine are considered to be the natural hosts of SV-A and all known SV-A sequenced isolates have been obtained from pigs. Previously, by regression analysis of partial genome sequences, it was suggested that different isolates of SV-A had a common ancestor and were assumed to have been introduced into the US pig populations (http://www.europic.org.uk/Europic2006/posters/Knowles.svv.01.pdf). Virus isolated in cell culture from tissue specimens of a diseased pig presenting vesicular lesions on the snout and feet in 2005, was identified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories\u2019 (NVSL) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) as SV-A using a broad pan-viral microarray (unpublished data). More recently, this vesicular disease syndrome, with as yet unidentified etiology, has been termed swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD) [5, 6]. Despite the isolation of SV-A in cell culture, FADDL has been unsuccessful at reproducing clinical signs by experimental inoculation of pigs with live virus. Negative observations were also made by other laboratories who conducted animal inoculations with multiple SV-A isolates [7]. Singh et al (2012) proposed SV-A as the causative agent of SIVD from a detailed clinical, diagnostic and histopathological study on a Chester White boar suffering from anorexia, lethargy, lameness and vesicular lesions [8]. However, association of SV-A with SIVD, or as the sole causative agent, is speculative at this time since the virus has also been isolated from pigs lacking clinical disease [2]. SIVD has been reported in pigs in the continents of North America and Australia [6, 9\u201311]. Although SIVD itself does not pose an economic concern, veterinary diagnosis from clinical signs is complicated since similar vesicular lesions can be formed due to common viral infections such as parvovirus, enterovirus, toxins in food supply, or burns [12\u201316]. Additionally, SIVD clinically resembles high consequence transboundary animal diseases (TADs) such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), vesicular stomatitis (VS), and vesicular exanthema of swine (VES). A few laboratory methods have been developed for detection of SV-A including a virus serum antibody neutralizing test and a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (cELISA), which are not widely available [7, 17]. The principal aim of this study was to develop a specific real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for fast, sensitive, and quantitative detection of SV-A RNA in vesicular diagnostic tissues.",

Doubling efficiency of the amplified target DNA was estimated to be 86% from the y-slope (-3.72) with a regression R2 value greater than 0.99 (Fig 2). Diagnostic RNA samples with controls were analyzed by RT-qPCR, and the products were subsequently visualized by DNA gel electrophoresis to demonstrate correlation of amplification products to the presence or absence of a specific target.

All of these diagnostic specimens, listed in Table 2, were previously diagnosed negative for the presence of high-consequence porcine vesicular diseases including FMDV, VSV, VESV, and SVDV, but all possible endemic vesicular disease rule outs were not evaluated. A total of 67 (79% of total specimens analyzed) diagnostic specimens, representing 44 (i.e., 88% of animals tested) clinical animals, showed detectable amplification plots with Ct values ranging between 11 to 38 and Tm values of approximately 78\u00b0C, indicating detectable SV-A in those specimens (summarized in Table 2). A slight variation in Tm of products was observed and expected due to known variations in base composition of target amplicon sequences among different isolates and also due to differences of ramping and Tm collection rates of the thermal cyclers used. Thus, the products which contained a single melting peak with positive CT values produced Tm values within the range of 77.7 to 80.8\u00b0C, with a mean of 79.3\u00b0C. Melting temperature parameters fell within the range of 79.3\u00b0C \u00b11.6\u00b0C. SV-A RNA was found in a variety of different types of clinical specimens including vesicular fluid, epithelium, lymph node, swabs and epithelium from hoof lesion, etc., (Table 2). Of note, many of the vesicular diagnostic specimens were also found positive for the presence of one or more common viruses such as circovirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, pestivirus, etc., suggesting frequent co-infections of SV-A with other porcine viruses in field animals. Thirteen RT-qPCR positive samples were also tested by the conventional RT-PCR assay, confirming SV-A presence in all samples. Similarly, 18 RT-qPCR negative samples were confirmed for absence of SV-A particles by conventional RT-PCR assay and RNA integrity was confirmed present using the beta-actin RT-qPCR as previously described (data not shown).",

Differential diagnosis of SIVD from high consequence vesicular animal diseases, such as FMD, is crucial due to trade and movement restriction and other economic impacts associated with foreign animal diseases. Therefore, FADDL routinely investigates the presence of SV-A as the possible cause of vesicular lesions in swine while performing priority diagnosis from other devastating vesicular diseases including FMD by respective disease-specific RT-qPCR assays. The SV-A RT-qPCR test developed in this study complemented our laboratory needs for a fast, specific, sensitive and quantitative assay. Once demonstrated as sensitive, specific and reproducible in feasibility studies, we applied it to analyze swine vesicular diagnostic specimens that were previously found negative of the foreign animal disease agents FMD, VS, SVD and VES. Surprisingly, 88% of animals with vesicular lesions were positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR, confirming the previous observation that the virus appears to be associated with SIVD [7]. The SV-A conventional PCR was previously performed upon request only, and the SVV qRT-PCR assay was only performed regularly starting in June 2015 on all swine vesicular investigation submissions, due to the increased prevalence of the virus. The virus was detected in several types of tissue specimens suggesting that it is ubiquitously distributed in different organs of an infected animal. Some of the RNA templates demonstrated very low Ct values (<14) suggesting a high presence of SV-A particles in those specimens. Additionally, the virus could not be detected in any of the tissues from the 35 pigs that did not possess SIVD signature clinical signs.",

In this study, we were able to directly detect the low levels of SV-A RNA, presumably viral genome, in 27% of sera from swine with or without SIVD symptoms. This included 3 feral swine indicating that wildlife can serve as the possible natural reservoir of the virus. Recently, Yang et al 2012 [6] described the development of a SV-A indirect and cELISA assays which could be used for specific detection of SV-A serum antibodies. While farm animals are routinely monitored for appearance of vesicular lesions and precautionary laboratory diagnoses are done on suspect animals, feral swine are less frequently observed for vesicular disease. Pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown, and a cause for the observed high frequency of SV-A infection in animals presenting with vesicular disease is not yet understood. It is likely that environmental stressors or other infectious agents may be required in addition to SV-A for induction of SIVD. This assumption is supported by our frequent detection of other porcine viruses along with SV-A in clinical field animals and on an observed correlation from case histories indicating stressful conditions, such as movement, and the presence of SV-A in vesicular tissues presented in Table 2. An additional factor complicating the understanding of pathogenicity is the potential for sequence variation between strains of SV-A. Employing sensitive and specific detection methods for SV-A in rule-out diagnostic investigations of high consequence vesicular diseases in swine may not only help to resolve such disease investigations but ultimately may help to better understand the factors contributing to the presentation of SIVD.",
