The largest epidemic of CHIKV disease ever recorded took place during 2004\u20132011, and involved an estimated 1.4 to 6.5 million cases and the first autochthonous CHIKV infections in Europe (Italy in 2007 and France in 2010) [2], [3]. Imported cases were also reported in nearly 40 countries, including European countries, Japan, and the USA. The epidemic was associated with the emergence of a new clade of viruses, which were efficiently transmitted by Aedes albopictus, a mosquito vector that has seen a dramatic global expansion in its geographic distribution [4]\u2013[6]. CHIKV disease is characterized by acute and chronic polyarthritis/polyarthralgia, which is usually symmetric and often incapacitating and occasionally protracted [4]\u2013[8]. Other symptoms, such as fever, rash, myalgia, and/or fatigue, are often also present during the acute phase. The recent epidemic was also associated with atypical and severe clinical forms of CHIKV disease and some fatalities, which appeared to be restricted to the very young and elderly patients with comorbidities [8], [9].",

The folding, transport to the surface and function of these glycoproteins relies on their correct interactions with each other. E1 consists of three \u03b2-sheet domains, termed I, II and III, while E2 contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (A, B and C, with A being at the N-terminus). In the complex, domain B lies at the membrane distal end and contacts E3, domain C is closest to the viral membrane and domain A is in the center. E1 interacts laterally with E2 all along domain II, along with additional points of contact from other regions of E1. E1 contains an internal fusion loop at the tip of domain II, which in the mature structure exists as a \u03b2-hairpin lodged in a groove between domains A and B of E2 [15]. E3 also plays a role in protecting the fusion loop from premature exposure.",

            "text": "Treatment of CHIKV rheumatic disease usually involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or simple analgesics, which can provide relief but is often inadequate [8]. Although a number of vaccine strategies have been, or are being, explored [16]\u2013[19], there are currently no licensed human vaccines [20]. Nevertheless, it is clear that CHIKV neutralizing antibodies from infected humans or vaccinated monkeys can mediate protection prophylactically, or soon after exposure. Polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from humans recovered from CHIKV infection, when passively transferred into neonatal and interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor deficient (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice, protected these animals from CHIKV-induced viremia and mortality [21]. Purified total IgG from monkeys immunized three times with a CHIKV virus-like-particle vaccine (containing E1 and E2) similarly protected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice from CHIKV viremia and mortality [17]. A recent study described two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 5F10 and 8B10, which were isolated from CHIKV infected individuals. These mAbs specifically neutralized CHIKV and o'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV, a virus closely related to CHIKV), but none of the other alphaviruses tested [22]. The 5F10 and 8B10 mAbs, when used in escape mutant studies were shown to recognize key residues in E2 (V216) and E1 (T101), respectively [23]. The combination of 5F10 and 8B10 were also shown to significantly delay CHIKV-driven lethality in mice deficient in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 receptors, and mature B and T cells [24]. Similarly, a group of mouse-derived mAbs, clustering close to the putative receptor-binding domain of E2 [25], were also found to be protective to various degrees in mouse models of CHIKV [26]. Additionally, an immunodominant linear epitope at the N-terminus of E2 is also a target for protective antibodies [27].",

In total, 910 CHIKV Env mutants were generated (98.5% coverage), sequence confirmed, and arrayed into 384-well plates. Each Env mutant was transfected into HEK-293T cells and allowed to express for 22 hrs. Cells were stained for 1 h with human mAbs C9 (0.42 \u00b5g/ml), E8 (2 \u00b5g/ml), CKV061 (0.75 \u00b5g/ml, isolated from phage display library in identical manner to E8), E26D9.02 (0.5 \u00b5g/ml, a gift from Dendritics), and rabbit polyclonal antibody (1\u22362000 dilution, a gift from IBT Bioservices) diluted in 10% NGS (Sigma). mAbs were detected using 3.75 \u00b5g/ml AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% NGS (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. Mean cellular fluorescence was detected using the Intellicyt high throughput flow cytometer (HTFC, Intellicyt). Antibody reactivities against each mutant Env clone were calculated relative to wild-type env protein reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type Env-transfected controls. Mutations were identified as critical to the epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test human mAb, but did support reactivity of the other CHIKV antibodies. This counter-screen strategy facilitates the exclusion of env mutants that are misfolded or have an expression defect [34]. Critical amino acids required for antibody binding were visualized on CHIKV env crystal structures (monomer PDB ID #3N41 and trimer PDB ID #2XFC, [15]), to obtain 3D epitope maps.",

Viremias were measured by collecting 40 \u00b5l of blood from a tail vein into 0.8-ml MiniCollect serum separation tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmunster, Austria). The tubes were spun at 4,000\u00d7g for 2.5 min on a bench-top microcentrifuge. Serum was collected and viral titers were determined as described previously and expressed as CCID50 per ml [35].",

Breeder pairs were housed under specific-pathogen free conditions in micro-isolator cages (Innovive Inc., San Diego, CA). Mice were checked daily and the date when litters were first observed was considered day 0. On day 9, litters with their mothers were transferred to static disposable cages (Innovive Inc.) and transferred a BSL-3 facility for infection and treatment. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice were infected with 5\u00d7105 PFU of CHIKV (S27 strain) intradermally in the ventral thorax. Some mice were also intraperitoneally injected with C9 or control human IgG/mouse in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) immediately prior to CHIKV infection. The control IgG used in this experiment was purified IgG from human serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Results were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves using Aable version 3.06 software (Gigawiz Ltd., Co., OK). The significance of differences was determined using log-rank chi-square analysis with the results not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Results are considered significant if P\u22640.05.",

The E2-A162 residue is solvent exposed and is predicted to be easily accessible when CHIKV Env is in the native trimer conformation (Figure 4). The E2-A162 residue is in the acid-sensitive region (ASR), sandwiched in a critical pocket between CHIKV E1, E2 and E3, as determined by the CHIKV envelope crystal structure [15], [40]. Interestingly, the ASR, along with the E2 domain B, was also recently described for alphaviruses as being unstructured following acid pH triggering [40]. In our study we found that residue E2-A162, when mutated to serine, reacted at 12% of WT reactivity against C9 but reacted at greater than 70% of WT reactivity against other anti-CHIKV antibodies, strongly suggesting that the E2-A162S mutant is properly folded and involved in the C9/envelope binding interaction (Figure 4A).

In contrast, in the same experiment, 6 week old mice injected with C9 IgG 24 hours prior to exposure to virus, showed no detectable viremia or foot swelling (Figure 5). These results demonstrate that the C9 antibody completely protected adult animals prophylactically against viremia and arthritic disease.",

We previously developed a CHIKV pseudovirus assay [28] that we found amenable in our current study for high-throughput screening and selection of B-cell clones expressing CHIKV neutralizing antibodies. C9 neutralizes both CHIKV pseudoviruses and replication-competent viruses with high potency. The E8 monoclonal antibody shows less dramatic neutralization of pseudovirus and does not neutralize live virus at the highest concentration tested (20 \u00b5g/ml). This suggests that although CHIKV antibody selection can be carried out using the high-throughput pseudovirus assays for greater convenience, a live virus-PRNT assay is the more reliable confirmatory assay for CHIKV neutralization.",

E8 recognized 6 spatially proximal residues (Y69, F84, V113, G114, T116A and D117) in E2 domain A, however the non-neutralizing nature of the E8 antibody suggests that the residues are not easily accessible on the native CHIKV envelope on live virus, and indeed the epitope appears to be partially occluded when visualized on the native trimer crystal structure. The site-directed mutagenesis mapping studies, confirmed by neutralization escape mutant studies, revealed that E2-A162 is a critical residue required for C9 mAb recognition. Interestingly, based on the crystal structure of the CHIKV envelope, the E2-A162 residue is located in the ASR of E2 that encompasses amino acids 159\u2013171 and 231\u2013258 [15]. The ASR in E2, along with domain B, is a highly conserved functional region among alphaviruses and is involved in the conformational rearrangements triggered by acid pH that lead to the exposure of the fusion loop in E1 and finally results in membrane fusion [15], [40]. It is possible that neutralizing antibodies such as C9 that bind to the ASR region could fully or partially prevent the disordering and dissociation of E2 from E1 following pH triggering, thereby reducing fusion efficiency and CHIKV entry. Residues within the ASR have previously been reported to be critical for efficient particle formation and stability [44], highlighting the delicate conformational balance that this region brings to E2.",

However, a previous study described a strain (Ag41855) isolated from Uganda during a 1982 outbreak that has a valine at the E2-162 position [41]. Mutating E2-A162 to valine did not result in a loss of C9 potency, suggesting C9 should be active against most currently circulating strains of CHIKV and other strains that arise in the future with that particular amino-acid. The fact that E2 proteins bearing the aliphatic, hydrophobic amino-acids alanine or valine did not prevent C9 neutralization, while E2 with a polar serine residue at position 162 escaped neutralization, suggests that C9 forms a critical hydrophobic interaction with that side-chain position.",

While, the isolation and epitope characterization of C9 antibody and demonstration of its potent neutralization in vitro and in vivo are invaluable to future studies aimed at identification of neutralization epitopes in order to produce effective antigens for vaccines, we hypothesize that the epitope recognized by the C9 antibody is also an important region to target for antibody-based intervention in future anti-CHIKV strategies.

Clones with reactivity <20% relative to wild-type CHIKV env were identified as critical for C9 binding. Mutation of residue A162 in E2 to serine significantly reduced C9 binding (green bar) but did not affect binding of E8 (red bar) or other control antibodies (gray bars). Residues are numbered according to E2 in PDB entry #3N41 [15]. (B) A162S and A162V pseudoviruses were tested for C9 inhibitory potency. The infectivity of the mutants compared to WT was tested (inset graph), indicating that the mutants did not hinder CHIKV env folding or function. Average raw luminescence units are shown for each construct and an env-minus negative control. (C) The critical residue A162 (shown in green) was visualized on the CHIKV env crystal structure.
