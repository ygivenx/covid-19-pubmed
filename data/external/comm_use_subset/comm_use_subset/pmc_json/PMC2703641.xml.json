            "text": "Baculoviruses are large enveloped viruses with double-stranded circular DNA genomes and have been used for various biotechnological applications. Baculoviruses are utilized for the high level production of recombinant proteins in insect cells [1,2] and the gene transduction to mammalian cells both in vivo and in vitro as a foreign gene delivery vectors [3-5]. Moreover, budded baculoviruses are applied for displaying the recombinant proteins on their surface for antibody production, functional analysis of receptors and vaccine production [5-7]. More recently, an increasing number of investigators have challenged the use of baculovirus for gene therapy applications [8]. The preparation of modified baculovirus vectors which are able to direct gene expression in mammalian cells represents a safer alternative over classical mammalian viruses. In order to use baculoviruses in gene therapy, the development of efficient production process towards high-titer preparation is required, because of low baculovirus transduction efficiency in mammalian cells compared to other viral delivery system, e.g. retroviruses.",

These two DNA fragments have approximately 95.8% sequence identity. Recombinant BmNPV-CP-/bx-GGT2 stock [15], whose titer was determined by end-point dilution method, was diluted and its baculovirus DNA was extracted from each diluted baculovirus DNA solution by High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics K. K.). The cross point for each elute, containing baculovirus DNA, was determined by Q-PCR. As the number of cycle increased, the fluorescent intensity increased in all samples except for a negative control (Figure 1A). No DNA amplification was observed for negative control containing 6 \u03bcl of water instead of baculovirus DNA. The melting curves of amplified DNA fragment by Q-PCR were analyzed. Single peaks were observed at approximately 82\u00b0C, indicating that DNA fragments were amplified specifically by forward and reverse primers without any unspecific binding (Figure 1B). Standard calibration curve of cross points vs. virus titer is shown in Figure 1C. This result confirms that corresponding cross points and determined titers were correlated linearly with a correlation efficiency of 0.99. On 2% agarose gel, DNA fragment at between 100 and 200 bp markers was found without any other bands (Figure 1D).",

Five hundred \u03bcl of the filtrate was applied upon Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated with PBS. Elution was performed by PBS and every 0.5 ml was collected. Its chromatogram is shown in Figure 3A. The first peak was eluted between 6.5 and 8.5 ml in the void volume, and GP64 was detected in the first peak fractions (Fraction 14, 15 in Figure 3A). Maximum baculovirus titer was 4.86 \u00d7 107 pfu (Figure 3B) at the fraction 14 and the total number of recovered rBmNPV-hPRR was 1.21 \u00d7 108 pfu with recovery ratio of 100% (Table 2). It suggested that there is no loss of BmNPV at this purification step. However the concentration of the virus was done by ultracentrifugation, and its recovery decreased by 30% (Table 2). Finally, rBmNPV-hPRR was purified by 48-fold.",

Baculovirus infection was not observed using transfection solution as baculovirus solution, indicating that it is difficult for the amount of rBmNPV-hPRR in transfection solution to infect Bm5 cells in normal condition due to a very small amount of baculovirus titer. This implies that many amplification steps are a prerequisite towards a successful infection of Bm5 cells. It takes at least a month to amplify baculoviruses up to a sufficient titer. Using hemolymph as a baculovirus stock to increase baculovirus titer can thus save time, cost and labor.

In the case of purification of BmNPV from silkworm larval hemolymph, this paper gives the first report using SEC. Quantity of rBmNPV-hPRR per mg of protein decreased at 5 days p.i. compared to 4 days p.i.. However, protein-band pattern in purified rBmNPV-hPRR at 4 and 5 days p.i. was similar; this denotes that there was no contamination in purified rBmNPV-hPRR at 5 days p.i.. But proteins of which rBmNPV-hPRR is composed of may increase at 5 days p.i.. In fact, purified rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph at 5 days p.i. contained more envelope proteins than that at 4 days p.i.. Moreover, hPRR which is expressed in the envelope was observed at 5 days p.i., but not 4 days p.i. Electron micrographs revealed that purified rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph at 5 days p.i. possessed thick envelopes, resulting in low purification efficiency of rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph at 5 days p.i.. The increase of envelope proteins in rBmNPV-hPRR of larval hemolymph at 5 days p.i. was caused by thick envelopes around rBmNPV-hPRR particles. Besides, it was previously reported that increase of mutant virus, defective interfering baculoviruses (DIs), which lacks considerable parts of its genome, was observed during serial passage of AcMNPV in insect cells [29,30] and the large deletion of its genome may be caused by several hetero- and homologous recombination mechanism [31]. DIs of BmNPV was also found in cultured cells [32]. DIs might not be detected by Q-PCR titer measurement method because of the large deletion of its genome, probably the loss of ie-1 gene. It is suggested that DIs, which missed ie-1 gene, increased in hemolymph during BmNPV infection and therefore quantity of rBmNPV-hPRR per mg of protein decreased at 5 day p.i.",

Hemolymph from silkworm larva infected by rBmNPV (rBmNPV-hPRR) contains its titer in higher amount of BmNPV, even though 1:105 diluted hemolymph was injected to silkworm larva. Moreover, a higher titer of rBmNPV-hPRR solution (4.50 \u00d7 109 pfu/ml) was obtained from silkworm larval hemolymph. Purification of rBmNPV-hPRR from silkworm larval hemolymph was successfully implemented by Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography. The purified rBmNPV-hPRR showed that the hPRR was displayed on the surface of rBmNPV. This system allows a large-scale production and purification of rBmNPV displaying recombinant protein, which can be applicable for the functional analysis of receptors, drug delivery system and vaccines against infectious viruses and protozoa.",
