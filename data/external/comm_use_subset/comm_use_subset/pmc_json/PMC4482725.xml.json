The generally accepted belief is that genetic diversity provides a benefit for RNA viruses for which success depends on the capacity to effectively proliferate in a range of internal environments and evade host immunity [4\u20136]. Such plasticity could be particularly beneficial for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), which require successful infection, replication and transmission by taxonomically divergent vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.",

            "text": "On the other hand, some would argue that mutation rate is simply coupled to replication rate and that the low fidelity of RNA viruses is not a requirement, but rather a consequence of selection for maximum replicative fitness [7]. There is indeed a clear relationship between replication fidelity and replication rate [8], but there is also evidence that the two can be uncoupled. For example, the high-fidelity variant of poliovirus (PV), G64S, was shown to have replicative kinetics equivalent to wildtype virus in vitro [9\u201311]. Pushing mutation rate beyond maximum replicative fitness creates a scenario in which genetic information is lost and selection can no longer outpace the accumulation of deleterious mutations, termed lethal mutagenesis [12,13]. Selection for mutational robustness could buffer somewhat against the negative impacts of increased mutational load, yet there is clearly a limit to this, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of ribavirin and other mutagenic antivirals against a range of RNA viruses [14,15]. In addition, previous studies demonstrate that mutator variants of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), coxsackievirus (CV), SARS-coronavirus and PV are highly attenuated [16\u201319]. Conversely, high-fidelity variants of PV, CV, foot and mouth disease virus and CHIKV have also been shown to be attenuated in various hosts [10,20\u201325], suggesting that there is likely a delicate balance between the need for accuracy and diversity among RNA viruses.",

Given the species-specific differences in selective pressure and virus-host interactions, there is clearly a need to individually characterize these relationships for other medically important arboviruses [26]. In addition, direct evidence linking specific arbovirus mutations to biochemical alterations affecting fidelity have not been presented, and therefore the mechanism of altered fidelity, including the role of specific structural changes in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and allosteric interactions with other proteins in the replication complex, are not well defined. Lastly, there is intriguing evidence that not just the effect of altered mutation rate, but fidelity itself could be host or even cell-specific [27], which could be particularly relevant for arboviruses.",

Although WNV is one of the most well characterized arboviruses in terms of evolution and host-virus interactions, there are gaps in our understanding of host-specific selective pressures and genetic correlates of viral fitness and pathogenesis. While there is evidence of superior WNV fitness in mosquitoes with highly homogeneous strains [28], and the accumulation of diversity in mosquitoes could simply be a product of relaxed purifying selection as a result of mutational robustness [29], there is also evidence for a correlation between WNV fitness and intrahost diversity in mosquito cell culture and Culex mosquitoes [30\u201332]. Increased diversity has also been associated with decreased WNV virulence in mice [31], suggesting that altering the capacity to accumulate mutations could have host-specific phenotypic consequences.",

Both lineages were passaged in the presence of 50, 100 and 250uM ribavirin, and the virus with the highest infectious titer at 5 days post-infection (pi) was used to initiate the subsequent passage at all concentrations of ribavirin. Ribavirin-treated HeLa cell monolayers were also infected with fresh stock of WNV-IC at each passage as a naive control for comparative antiviral resistance of serially passaged virus. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 was used to initiate all passages and resistance assays. In addition to ribavirin, susceptibility to 50uM 5-fluorouracil (Sigma) was also determined for select WNV strains. HeLa cells were grown in EMEM supplemented with 100ug/ml penicillin streptomycin and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For all cells treated with antiviral compounds growth media was removed and monolayers in 6-well cell culture plates were overlaid with 1ml media containing the antiviral compound and incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C. Media was then removed and replaced with 100ul of virus diluted in media supplemented with antiviral compound and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, 3mls of media supplemented with desired concentration of antiviral was added to each well. Supernatants were harvested at day 5 pi and titrated by plaque assay on African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells (ATCC) according to standard protocol [34]. In order to isolate clonal strains with decreased antiviral susceptibility, 20 individual plaques were harvested from Vero monolayers following the completion of passage 6, re-suspended in 100ul of EMEM, inoculated onto fresh Vero monolayers and grown in liquid culture for 96h. Susceptibility of mutagens was reported as log10 reduction and titer and compared using t-tests following confirmation of normality (GraphPad Prism, Version 5.0).",

The cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, cooled to 15\u00b0C and then grown for 36\u201340 h. Typically, after 36\u201340 h at 15\u00b0C the OD600 reached ~7.0\u201310.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 x g, 10 min) and the cell pellet was washed once in 200 mL of TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA), centrifuged again, and the cell paste weighed. Typically, yields were 20 g of cell paste per liter of culture. The cells were then frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until used.

After loading, the column was washed with fifty column volumes of buffer A and five column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. Protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were collected and assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE. Fractions with the highest purity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol; MWCO of 24,000 Da). The dialyzed protein was then passed thru a Hi-Load 16/600 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B at 1 ml/min using an AktaPrime system. Fractions (3 mL) were collected, assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE, pooled and then concentrated to 150 \u03bcM (~15 mg/mL) using a Vivaspin concentrator (30,000 MWCO). The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm by using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 221,730 M-1 cm-1.

The highest level of mutagen resistance was measured with the RdRp double mutant, WNV V793I/G806R, for which 2.2 and 4.6-fold mean titer reduction were measured following ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil treatments, respectively, as compared to 55 and 37-fold mean titer reductions measured with WNV-IC (Fig 3).",

Levels of WNV RNA for both WNV-IC and mutant strains were statistically similar for all samples chosen for sequencing (~9.0 log10 WNV copies/ml), suggesting differences in replication were not likely to account for differences in the number of mutations accumulated. Assays were completed in duplicate for each WNV strain and sequencing results identified fewer SNPs in all mutant strains relative to WNV-IC, with the exception of the methyltransferase mutant, WNV T248I, for which the number of unique SNPs identified was approximately 2.5 fold higher than WNV-IC. The RdRp double mutant, WNV V793I/G806R, showed the fewest number of unique SNPs; approximately 2.5 fold lower than WNV-IC (Fig 4B). Mutations were distributed throughout the sequenced regions for all WNV strains, yet mutant swarm composition varied significantly among strains (Fig 4C). Specifically, transition to transversion ratios were ~2:1 for WNV-IC and WNV T248I, yet <1 for WNV V793I/G806R. Decreased mutation of WNV V793I/G806R relative to WNV-IC resulted primarily from lack of U to C and G to A mutations, which accounted for 11/28 mutations for WNV-IC and 0/12 mutations for WNV V793I/G806R (chi-squared, p = 0.011). Increased mutation of WNV T248I, on the other hand, resulted primarily from A misincorporations, which accounted for 33/62 mutations for WNV T248I, and just 7/28 mutations of WNV-IC (chi-squared, p = 0.045). Approximately the same number of U to A mutations were identified for WNV V793I/G806R as WNV T248I (4 vs 3), yet no G to A mutations were identified for WNV V793I/G806R, in stark contrast to the 20 identified for WNV T248I (Fig 4C). These results demonstrate strain-specific differences in the misincorporation of different nucleotides and, more specifically, in the propensity for particular mispairs, suggesting mutation frequencies may be dependent on both replication complex and template sequences and/or context.",

Complexes were assembled using a 5\u2019-phosphorylated trinucleotide primer (pGGC), single stranded RNA template, UTP and CTP (Fig 5A). The template was designed such that two nucleotides led to production of a 15-mer RNA. Labeling of the elongation complex was achieved by using \u03b1-32P-labeled nucleotide. Once assembled, the complex was stable and capable of rapid incorporation of the next correct nucleotide substrate (elongation) to produce a 16-mer RNA product. The elongation competent complex was then used to interrogate the kinetics of nucleotide misincorporation. The initial substrate, designed to measure G:U mispairs was used to quantify GMP misincorporation for each NS5 protein (Fig 5B and 5C). Comparing the percentage of RNA product produced over time, it was demonstrated that WNV-IC, V793I/G806R and T248I NS5 proteins displayed similar in vitro kinetics for GMP misincorporation (Fig 5C). These results were consistent with a lack of biological differences in fidelity among NS5 variants, but were also in agreement with deep-sequencing data, for which the number of A to G substitutions were similar among WNV-IC, WNV V793I/G806R, and WNV T248I (Fig 4C). In order to evaluate fidelity differences implied by deep-sequencing data, the template for biochemical assays was redesigned to quantify A:C mispairs, equivalent to G to A substitutions. The number and proportion of G to A substitutions identified following growth in mosquito cells differed among strains, with means of 6, 0 and 20 identified in WNV-IC, WNV V793I/G806R, and WNV T248I, respectively (Fig 4C). Biochemical assays were consistent with these results, clearly demonstrating an increasing rate of A misincorporation for WNV T248I relative to WNV-IC and a decreasing rate of A misincorporation for WNV V793I/G806R (Fig 5C). Taken together, these results demonstrate sequence-specific fidelity differences among WNV mutant strains.",

Specifically, consistently lower viral titers were measured for all RdRp and Mtase mutants in mosquito cells relative to WNV-IC (Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test, p<0.05), and kinetics were similar among mutants with the exception of WNV V793I, which despite having significantly lower titers than WNV-IC had modestly higher titers relative to other mutants (Fig 6). In addition, WNV RNA was quantified with qRT-PCR following one-step growth and particle/pfu ratios were quantified and compared among WNV-IC, WNV V793I/G806R and WNV T248I in order to assess the relationship between fidelity and infectivity. Specific infectivity was elevated in mosquito cells as compared to vertebrate cells for all WNV strains (Fig 7). Trends measured with infectivity are consistent with identified fidelity differences in both cell lines, with the highest infectivity measured with the RdRp double mutant WNV V793I/G806R and the lowest infectivity measured with the Mtase mutant WNV T248I, yet differences were only significant relative to WNV-IC for WNV T248I in BHK cells (t-test, df = 4, p = 0.0028; Fig 7).

Input titers were comparable to a natural dose and similar among WNV strains and experimental replicates (Table 3; [43]). Despite the fact that levels of infection were somewhat lower than have been measured with other wildtype WNV strains (35.8%), stark and highly significant differences were measured when compared to WNV mutants (chi-squared, p<0.001 for all mutants relative to WNV-IC). Specifically, over the course of 3 experimental replicates and multiple time points, a total of just 2 of 210 (V793I/G806R) and 3 of 203 (T248I) mosquitoes acquired measurable infections. To confirm that this was generalizable phenotype which was relevant in natural populations, infectivity experiments were repeated in Cx. quinquefasciatus recently acquired from the field. Although modestly lower input titers were used, infectivity was slightly higher for WNV-IC relative to colonized mosquitoes (39.2%) and a general lack of infectivity was confirmed for replication complex mutants (Table 3).

            "text": "Although fully characterizing the mechanism by which these RdRp residues alter fidelity would require further biochemical and biophysical investigations, mapping of T248, V793 and G805 residues on the crystal structures of NS5 [41,42] provides some indication of possible mechanisms (see Fig 2). Despite the lack of full-length NS5 structure from WNV, the relative orientation of the Mtase domain with respect to the polymerase domain can be defined using the recent crystal structure of the full length dengue virus (DENV) NS5 [47] as a guide. The two NS5 structures are highly similar with an RMSD of 1.18 and 0.65 \u00c5 for the polymerase and Mtase domains, respectively. The residues V793 and G805 are located in the priming loop (aa 789\u2013812), which is a long loop that links two \u03b1-helices in the thumb subdomain and protrudes to reach the active site. Conformational dynamics of the priming loop is believed to be necessary to form a stable initiation complex [42]. A model of the initiation complex is shown in Fig 2B; in this model a 4-mer ssRNA substrate, taken from the complex structure of the related \u02786-RdRp (PDB 1HI0) [48], and rNTP modeled at the priming site (P-site) and catalytic site (C-site) based on the HCV RdRp complex structure (PDB 1GX5) [40] can be accommodated in the WNV NS5 RdRp active site with minimal steric clashes with the protein atoms. To form a stable initiation complex, the active-site residue Trp-800 would alter its sidechain conformation to be able to stack against the priming nucleotide. The priming loop maintains numerous interactions with residues from the thumb, fingers and palm subdomains and substitutions similar to V793I and G806R could potentially disrupt these interactions, impacting the dynamics of the priming loop and subsequently affecting the initiation process of the RdRp. It is not difficult to conceive that V793I and G806R may restrict the dynamics of the priming loop, leading to a higher fidelity mutant in a scenario similar to what has recently been shown for the G64S high-fidelity mutant of PV RdRp [49,50]. In these studies of PV RdRp, remote site mutations altered the polymerase fidelity by causing changes to the dynamics of conserved structural elements and motifs including residues at the active site. Although the interactions of the flavivirus RdRp and Mtase have now been well-documented [51,52] the finding that modifications to allosteric interactions resulting from mutation of a single residue of the Mtase can significantly alter replication fidelity is novel. The T248I mutation is located at the C-terminal loop (aa 245\u2013267) of the MTase domain; which is expected to be at the interface between the two domains of the WNV NS5 (Fig 2C), similar to what is observed in the homologous DENV NS5 structure. The loop harboring T248 is predicted to interact with the region of the fingers in the polymerase domain (aa 350\u2013365). It is very likely that amino acid substitution of T248 by an isoleucine could affect the interactions between the two domains and the inter-domain dynamics, eventually affecting the polymerase active site and altering fidelity. Findings with WNV are therefore consistent with previous data demonstrating that RdRp fidelity is determined by a complex network of interactions and checkpoints by which remote site mutations may alter the dynamics of conserved structural elements and motifs including residues at the active site [9,49,53,54].",

            "text": "Although selection for ribavirin resistance did, as predicted, result in the isolation of high fidelity WNV variants, the fact that a mutator variant also displayed resistance could be explained by antiviral mechanisms independent of lethal mutagenesis for WNV in this system. Similar results were attained with FMDV, for which a low fidelity RdRp was found to have a decreased capacity for ribavirin incorporation [55]. In addition, previous studies with another flavivirus, yellow fever virus, demonstrate that the antiviral actions of ribavirin are conferred primarily by the depletion of intracellular GTP pools [56]. Additional antiviral mechanisms of ribavirin have also been proposed, including inhibition of virus transcription [57] and inhibition of both guanyltranferase and Mtase activity [58,59]. The flavivirus Mtase is required for RNA capping [60], a process partially enabled by GTP binding [61] and competitively inhibited by ribavirin with DENV NS5 [58]. Although T248 is not within the nucleotide binding site it is possible that this mutation could perturb these interactions and subsequently interfere with antiviral susceptibility in this manner. On the other hand, given that WNV T248I also displays resistance to 5-fluorouracil, it is possible that the strain-dependent mutational biases could result in unique evolutionary trajectories and, subsequently, strain-specific differences in mutational robustness and susceptibility to lethal mutagenesis.",

Although others have demonstrated that modifications to fidelity are attainable, the possibility that unique strains may possess unique mutational biases has novel functional and evolutionary implications. Specifically, if mutational landscapes are strain-specific, so too are fitness landscapes of viral swarms and therefore evolutionary pressures acting on them. Such biases could be exploited by evolution as a means of increasing the probability of producing favorable mutant swarms following genetic bottlenecks or could have the opposite effect of constraining deleterious strains by not permitting adequate exploration of sequence space to escape unfit landscapes.",

            "text": "Consistent with previous studies with CHIKV [24] in vitro kinetics were generally similar for the high fidelity WNV V793I/G806R relative to WNV-IC, with modest attenuation measured in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Although fitness differences were only measurable with direct competition of CHIKV and not individual growth assays, the decreases in mutation rate measured for WNV V793I/G806R were also more substantial than those measured for CHIKV, likely due to combining two RdRp mutations which appear to have an additive effect on fidelity. These host-specific effects are consistent with previous studies demonstrating increased swarm diversity in the mosquito for both WNV and its close relative St. Louis encephalitis virus [31,62], but further suggest that the invertebrate environment is not simply a more robust environment which tolerates diversity, but one in which diversity itself likely provides a fitness benefit [30]. It is possible that this fitness benefit results from an inherent need to escape RNAi or other innate invertebrate immune responses [63], or that enhancements in fitness could result from cooperative interactions among distinct genotypes and viral proteins [64]. Despite this, previous passage studies in Cx. pipiens suggest that this need for diversity may be overcome by individual variants with highly superior fitness [28] and results presented here demonstrating attenuation of the low fidelity mutant WNV T248I suggest, not surprisingly, that there is a limit to the benefit of diversity. The association of mutator phenotypes with either similar or attenuated viral growth kinetics is consistent with what has been observed in other systems [17\u201319], and gives further credence to the idea that replication and mutation rate are not necessarily inextricably bound phenotypes. Given that vertebrate environments have been found to be more restrictive both in vitro and in vivo [32,65], it is somewhat surprising that a virus with a mutator phenotype would not also be attenuated in vertebrate cell culture, yet even if WNV T248I is more mutationally robust than WNV-IC, attenuation may be observed if this strain were repeatedly passaged, therefore accumulating diversity and, presumably, deleterious mutants [17,18]. Consistent with this is the fact that the Mtase mutant was also found to be less infectious in vertebrate cell culture. In addition, competition assays with increased sensitivity for detecting more subtle fitness differences [24,66] or in vivo models that more accurately represent natural infections could reveal important phenotypic differences in vertebrate systems [67]. Although in the current studies results confirm that inherent biochemical differences account for differences in mutation rate independent of cell type, it is also feasible that fidelity itself could be host-dependent, as a recent study with vesicular stomatitis virus demonstrates slower mutation rates in insect cells as compared to mammalian cells [27]. Although few have investigated this concept [68], it is not necessarily surprising that the biophysical and biochemical properties of the replication complex might differ significantly in environments with variable temperature, pH, and nucleotide availability. Future studies exploiting new sequencing technologies to evaluate mutation rates in a range of systems will help to clarify these differences [17,69,70].",

Although studies with CHIKV also demonstrate that fidelity variants are associated with decreased infectivity in mosquitoes, differences measured for WNV here are much more profound. These results suggest either that WNV replication in gut epithelial cells is uniquely sensitive to alterations in fidelity or that alternative mechanisms of attenuation related to host interaction with the flavivirus NS5 exist. Regardless, these variants provide powerful tools to elucidate the determinants of flavivirus mosquito competence and novel targets for viral attenuation.",
