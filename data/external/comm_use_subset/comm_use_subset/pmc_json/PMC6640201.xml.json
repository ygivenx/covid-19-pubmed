With the development of sepsis, proinflammatory cytokine levels in the blood are significantly elevated (1\u20134), and Bone (5) noted that \u201ccytokine storm\u201d mortality remains elevated for a long period after a septic episode is resolved. During sepsis, high levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are circulating, and immune responses, including the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells, play critical roles in the regulation of sepsis (5, 6). CD4+ Th cells are the most important lymphocyte subset influencing innate and adaptive immune cells via cytokines and cell-to-cell interactions (7). Th1 cells are induced by IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in response to viral, bacterial and protozoan intracellular infections, and Th2 cells activated by IL-4 are important for the clearance of helminth infections (8, 9).",

            "text": "Diverse classes of biomolecules are packaged, coexpressed, and secreted from cells into bodily fluids to interact with other cells (12, 13), and biomolecules traveling a long distance are transported via a novel pathway. The production of exosomes can be spontaneously secreted depending on the cell type (14, 15) or induced by various stimuli (16). The biochemical composition of exosomes is variable depending on their cell origin (17), and exosomes have been shown to play key roles in regulating immune responses. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes and antigens carried in exosomes are crucial for initiating and amplifying the immune response (18, 19), and determining whether circulating cytokines are released in a controlled manner as a compensatory mechanism in response to a stress signal is important. Konadu et al. (20) reported that HIV-infected and viremic individuals exhibited elevated levels of plasma cytokines, and most cytokines were colocalized with exosomes derived from mouse serum. Twenty-one cytokines and chemokines are markedly enriched in HIV-positive exosomes to negatively control and induce the expression of CD38 on CD4+/CD8+ T cells. The stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to increased exosomal chemokine and RNA levels and is thus involved in the regulation of inflammation (21). In this study, we isolated exosomes from the sera of septic mice, quantified their cytokine levels and assessed their immunomodulatory effect on lymphocytes to confirm our hypothesis that cytokines can be transferred among cells in septic mouse serum via an exosome secretion mechanism.",

            "text": "Sepsis is a lethal disease, and its progression is associated with high serum levels of cytokines, including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (1, 3), which play crucial roles in the development of sepsis (29). Recent studies demonstrate that in addition to existing in the soluble form in serum, cytokines also exist in exosomes. Konadu et al. (20) reported that exosomes purified from the plasma of HIV-seropositive individuals were actively and selectively enriched for most of the screened cytokines and chemokines. Due to the stability of exosomes, the half-lives of the cytokines and chemokines within exosomes are increased (30, 31). In the present study, we provide evidence that most cytokines/chemokines not only exist in the free form but are also packaged into exosomes in the sera of mice with sepsis. Here, we showed that the protein contents of exosomes harvested from the sera of septic mice increased with disease progression and reached a maximum level at 48 h after LPS challenge (Figure 1D). But we failed to detect any significant difference of the number of exosomes from septic mice in comparison with the control (Supplementary Figure 5). The proteins in exosomes reportedly vary among different cell types (32, 33), and in the progression of sepsis, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are released by various types of immune cells, such as T cells, B cells and macrophages. Cytokines/chemokines in both the soluble and exosomal forms reflect the complicated integration of the bioactivities of all immune cells. However, the two forms of serum cytokines/chemokines displayed different dynamics during the development of sepsis. Most of the soluble cytokines/chemokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-10, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10, in the sera of septic mice showed increased levels, which peaked at 2\u201312 h, whereas most of the cytokines/chemokines in the exosomes showed delayed peak expression at 12\u201324 h after sepsis modeling. Growth factors, such as VEGF, also showed varying dynamics between the soluble and exosomal forms in the sera of septic mice. Together, these results suggest that most cytokines/chemokines exist in both the soluble form and the exosome form but display different dynamics during the development of sepsis.",

We performed a blocking assay with neutralizing Abs specifically targeting mouse IL-12 (Figure 3C) or IL-4 (Figure 3D), revealing that the differentiation of T cells was promoted by the IL-12 and IL-4 cytokines, which were associated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Consistent with these results, Yu et al. showed that mTGF-\u03b21-Exo induced a vigorous Treg cell response (40). We also incubated the exosomes with purified T lymphocytes derived from TLR4 knockout mice and found that the exosomes from septic mice still enhanced Th1/Th2 cell differentiation (Supplementary Figure 2), indicating that the biological effects on Th1/2 differentiation were TLR4-independent. Together, these data implied that the exosomes from septic mice (Exo-24) had a potent capability to enhance Th1/2 cell differentiation via the actions of IL-12 and IL-4 cytokines.",

IL-4 blocking antibodies inhibit the differentiation of T cells might through direct interaction with IL-4 rapidly released from exosomes or targeted cells.

In this study, we demonstrated that the exosomes harvested from septic mice failed to directly recruit lymphocytes but enhanced the migration of lymphocytes by direct physical interaction, which was supported by analysis of the air pouch model in vivo.

In this study, we observed that pretreatment with exosomes from septic mice did exert significant biological effects. We found that administration of exosomes from septic mice inhibited the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 in the serum, alleviated tissue injuries in the lung and liver and prolonged the survival times of mice subjected to CLP modeling. TNF-\u03b1 is a vital proinflammatory cytokine, and IL-10 is a vital anti-inflammatory factor; both cytokines are involved in the development of sepsis. Suppression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 production provided a reasonable explanation for the remissive tissue injury and prolonged survival rates of mice.",

Preadministration of exosomes from septic mice not only suppressed cytokine production and alleviated tissue injury but also prolonged the survival of CLP mice. Characterizing the role of exosomes in sepsis would strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sepsis development and provide potential targets for therapeutic applications (51).",
