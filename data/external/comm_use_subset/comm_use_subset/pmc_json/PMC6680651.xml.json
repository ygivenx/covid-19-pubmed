Improved fertility and increased use of sexed semen have made replacement heifers more available for dairy operations [2]. Some producers keep all newborn replacement heifers in case more replacements are needed than anticipated, which can create a heavy financial burden for producers when raising excess heifers. Heifer raising expenses are often lumped into broad farm-wide expenses such as feed, labor, and health costs, making it difficult to accurately calculate heifer raising costs [3]. In addition, failing to identify the on-farm cost to raise a replacement heifer can allow for inefficiencies in feed, labor, housing, or health costs to go unnoticed, which accumulate unanticipated replacement female costs.",

For example, the average total cost to raise replacement heifers to wean was found to only increase by $82.88 per heifer from 2000 to 2015 but ranges within each study can exceed $350 per heifer [4,5,6]. Heinrichs [6] found a range in feed cost on 44 farms of $29.06 to $259.17 per calf; total cost per calf ranged $89.00\u2013$442.78 during the pre-weaning period. In a 2014 survey of 2545 heifer calves in the United States, individual housing was the dominant form of housing pre-weaned heifers at 86.6% and 13.4% were managed in group housing, yet 8 different housing types were reported [7]. Little research has examined the cost between housing types, although the University of Wisconsin has conducted surveys of producers in an automatic and conventional housing scenario. The average cost (min, max) of producers utilizing individual housing was $363.69 ($195.06, $530.76) and those with group housing was $401.58 ($138.39, $585.52), a difference in average cost of $37.89 per calf, but with a difference range of over $300 for individual and $400 for group housing [8].",

Utilization of labor and milk source requires additional decisions based on resources and availability. While gaining in popularity, only 1.9% of the calves were fed through an automatic feeder while almost half of the surveyed calves were fed using a bottle or a bucket [9]. On average, one calf requires 7\u201312 labor hours during the pre-weaning period, or 7\u201310 mins per day [8]. Unpasteurized whole milk was the most common milk source utilized by producers but close to 50% of those also utilized milk replacer [7]. More recent surveys show a similar trend, with 40.1% of calves fed whole or waste milk, 34.8% fed milk replacer, and 25.1% fed a combination of the two. Calf starter was provided, starting on average at 5 days old, to all calves surveyed [9]. ",

Thus, replacement heifers were assumed to require 3.7 M2 per calf. Construction cost [11] varied based on the infrastructure required for each situation, ranging from $10.00 to $15.50 per M2.

The model accounted for four possible feeding milk allotments: 6, 8, 10, and 12 L per calf per day. A 2016 survey of producers in the United States showed over half of the farms were feeding calves between 4\u20136 L per day [7]. Recent studies have shown that increasing milk allotment can increase average daily gain (ADG) pre-weaning, result in larger skeletal measurements at weaning, and decrease vocalizations caused by milk deprivation [12,13]. Milk allotments and starter intakes per calf for this model were reflective of experimental data [14]. In this study, calves were randomly assigned to 6, 8, 10, or 12 L feeding treatments of pasteurized whole milk with ad libitum access to calf starter. A step-down weaning program was performed: milk was fed at maximum allotment until weaning at 42 days. Milk allotment was decreased by 50% until day 50, where allotment was decreased daily by 20% until weaned. Calves were assumed to be consuming at least 2.25 kg of calf starter at weaning. An additional 20% was assumed to be fed to account for waste and loss. This additional expense was added to daily calf starter cost. Milk and calf starter costs were calculated on a daily basis for the entire pre-weaning period, from day 0 to 65. ADG was determined using the dry matter intake requirements and resulting gain from NRC, 2001. Calf weight was modeled daily to determine appropriate weaning weights based on dry matter intake from milk replacer or whole milk.",

Stochastic simulations allowed for variation of inputs values which are reflected in ranges of potential outcomes, unlike a static model which will always produce the same outcome. Modeling variables stochastically, such as weaning age, mortality rates, and disease prevalence, we can simulate different outcomes. All variables were modeled following a Pert distribution set with minimum, most likely, and maximum value. Assumptions were made based on published literature, surveys, and market assumptions were also used to calculate the total cost (Table 1). A month in the cost spreadsheet was considered 30 days. This model is available online at https://afs.ca.uky.edu/dairy/decision-tools, wherein all variables and assumptions can be modified to reflect different situations and individual farms.",
