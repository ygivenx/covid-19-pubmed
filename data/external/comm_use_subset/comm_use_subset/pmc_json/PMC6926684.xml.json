Health care-associated infection can occur during a patient\u2019s treatment process or many surgical procedures and poses a major threat to patient safety and care [2]. Health care-associated infections prolong hospital stays and increase the medical cost burden [3,4]. In Korea, the incidence of health care-associated infections has been reported to occur in 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients [5]. In 2015, 186 Korean cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred, mostly due to inappropriate infection control within the hospital [6]. For these reasons, Korean health care authorities and the government have strongly emphasized the control and prevention of health care-associated infections [6,7]. In particular, standard precautions comprise the minimal infection prevention policy that must be followed regardless of the kind of infectious disease; however, several international studies have reported that health professionals\u2019 adherence to standard precautions is suboptimal [1,3].",

In 2017, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Korean Society for Health Care-associated Infection Control and Prevention developed a standardized health care-associated infection prevention guideline in accordance with the circumstances [5]. Adherence to standard precautions comprises the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care including hand hygiene, sharps safety, use of personal protection, respiratory hygiene; safe management of blood and body fluid spillages; and decontamination of equipment, waste, linen, and laundry [10]. While standard precautions serve as the universal infection prevention guidelines which must always be followed, the results of several studies focused on nurses have revealed low adherence rates [1,12].",

At the organizational level, patient safety culture, personal protective equipment accessibility, and work environment [1,3,14] have been reported as factors that affect nurses\u2019 adherence to standard precautions. Particularly, it is necessary that health professionals demonstrate a high level of commitment and a strong, cohesive spirit among various departments in health care settings [9,20]. Importantly, patient safety management should be maintained in all hospitals to provide better quality of care. In this context, nurses\u2019 perception of patient safety management may be linked to workload demands, which involve lower safety activities such as infection control [21,22]. However, few studies have investigated whether nurses\u2019 perceptions of patient safety management are related to their adherence to standard precautions.",

At first, two researchers, proficient in both English and Korean, independently translated the CSPS into Korean, and then a third researcher compared the two versions and selected the best translation. Next, the translated Korean CSPS was evaluated by ten nurse experts with more than 10 years of clinical experience and postgraduate degrees to verify understanding and cultural congruence as well as to evaluate content validity. The four attributes of the questions were rated on a 4-point scale (1 = \u201cnot relevant\u201d; 4 = \u201chighly relevant\u201d). The content validity index was 0.87, with good congruence with the original version. To ensure the validity of the questionnaire, a pilot study was conducted two weeks prior to the main study. The questionnaire was distributed to 10 staff nurses to be tested for user-friendliness and clarity. No changes were made to the questionnaire after the pilot study as all questions were found to be clear. The questionnaire took 10 to 15 min to complete. Finally, the translation was sent to the original developer for another discussion to decide on the Korean translated version of the CSPS. The 20 items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 (1 = \u201cnever\u201d, 2 = \u201cseldom\u201d, 3 = \u201csometimes\u201d and 4 = \u201calways\u201d).

The total scores ranged from 0 to 20, and a higher score signified higher adherence to standard precautions.

According to Pereira et al.\u2019s study [28], standard precaution adherence rates for Brazilian and Hong Kong nurses were approximately 69.4% and 57.4%, respectively. This discrepancy, compared to previous studies, could have been related to the shorter clinical experiences of the participants in this study.

            "text": "In the present study, standard precaution adherence rates were relatively high in units with fewer than 20 nurses, such as newborn nurseries, delivery rooms, and psychiatric wards. Shin et al. [30] found that the standard precaution adherence rates of nurses in the newborn nurseries were higher than those of nurses in medical, surgical, and intensive care units. Since newborns are vulnerable to infections, and an environment with a large number of newborns is highly susceptible to the spread of infections, thorough implementation of infection prevention guidelines is important [32]. Such precautions reflect the specificity of departments that care for patients at high risk of infection, which likely result from safety management awareness and increased performance of safety precautions due to continuous infection rate monitoring and training. Additionally, the rate of adherence to standard precautions in this study was significantly lower among nurses who worked in settings where there were more than 15 patients per RN per shift. According to Korean medical laws, the daily patient census per RN is 2.5, which converts to an estimated patient-per-RN rate of approximately 15 per shift. The average estimated patient-per-RN rate per shift in Korean general hospitals from 1996 to 2013 was 16.3 to 21.8, which exceeded the minimum standards required by law [33]. Failure to obtain an adequate number of nurses leads to increased job burden, insufficient nursing time, and decreased job performance ability [34], and an increased rate of infections [17,34]. Accordingly, sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified nurses or optimal nurse-to-patient ratio should be considered to increase the rate of adherence to standard precautions for patient safety.",

More importantly, the multiple linear regression results revealed that nurses\u2019 perceptions of patient safety management were only significantly associated with adherence to standard precautions after adjusting for other covariates. As nurses\u2019 perceptions of patient safety management may affect nursing activities [14,26,35], raising nurses\u2019 awareness about patient safety management must be prioritized to increase adherence to standard precautions. Particularly, practical guidelines and continuous training to increase nurses\u2019 positive awareness, interest, and willingness to participate in patient safety management can contribute to improvements in practicing standard precautions [36]. Despite no observed significant relationship between nurse-to-patient ratio and adherence to standard precautions in hierarchical analysis, our correlation matrix showed that nurse-to-patient ratio was weakly associated with adherence to standard precautions. According to a recent review [37], low adherence to standard precautions may be caused by inappropriate work conditions (excessive workload and reduced teams). Thus, intervention studies are needed in future to improve work conditions such as appropriate staff sizing.",
