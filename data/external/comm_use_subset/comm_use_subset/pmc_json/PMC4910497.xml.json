            "text": "The need for a names-based cyber-infrastructure for digital biology is based on the argument that scientific names serve as a standardized metadata system that has been used consistently and near universally for 250 years. As we move towards data-centric biology, name-strings can be called on to discover, index, manage, and analyze accessible digital biodiversity information from multiple sources. Known impediments to the use of scientific names as metadata include synonyms, homonyms, mis-spellings, and the use of other strings as identifiers. We here compare the name-strings in GenBank, Catalogue of Life (CoL), and the Dryad Digital Repository (DRYAD) to assess the effectiveness of the current names-management toolkit developed by Global Names to achieve interoperability among distributed data sources. New tools that have been used here include Parser (to break name-strings into component parts and to promote the use of canonical versions of the names), a modified TaxaMatch fuzzy-matcher (to help manage typographical, transliteration, and OCR errors), and Cross-Mapper (to make comparisons among data sets). The data sources include scientific names at multiple ranks; vernacular (common) names; acronyms; strain identifiers and other surrogates including idiosyncratic abbreviations and concatenations. About 40% of the name-strings in GenBank are scientific names representing about 400,000 species or infraspecies and their synonyms. Of the formally-named terminal taxa (species and lower taxa) represented, about 82% have a match in CoL. Using a subset of content in DRYAD, about 45% of the identifiers are names of species and infraspecies, and of these only about a third have a match in CoL. With simple processing, the extent of matching between DRYAD and CoL can be improved to over 90%. The findings confirm the necessity for name-processing tools and the value of scientific names as a mechanism to interconnect distributed data, and identify specific areas of improvement for taxonomic data sources. Some areas of diversity (bacteria and viruses) are not well represented by conventional scientific names, and they and other forms of strings (acronyms, identifiers, and other surrogates) that are used instead of names need to be managed in reconciliation services (mapping alternative name-strings for the same taxon together). On-line resolution services will bring older scientific names up to date or convert surrogate name-strings to scientific names should such names exist. Examples are given of many of the aberrant forms of \u2018names\u2019 that make their way into these databases. The occurrence of scientific names with incorrect authors, such as chresonyms within synonymy lists, is a quality-control issue in need of attention. We propose a future-proofing solution that will empower stakeholders to take advantage of the name-based infrastructure at little cost. This proposed infrastructure includes a standardized system that adopts or creates UUIDs for name-strings, software that can identify name-strings in sources and apply the UUIDs, reconciliation and resolution services to manage the name-strings, and an annotation environment for quality control by users of name-strings.",

            "text": "The \u2018big new biology\u2019 complements traditional and reductionist approaches to biological research because it will be based on open sharing of data that will enable co-operative enterprises and large scale projects (National Research Council of the National Academies 2009). Within this emerging area, names are said to have a special role (Patterson et al. 2010; Pyle 2016) because, from the time of Linnaeus, biologists have applied a convention of forming and using scientific names. Scientific names annotate almost all useful biological statements for most of the intervening 250 years. They still play that role, but are supplemented increasingly with records in which organisms are identified through molecular sequence data - such as molecular barcodes (Hebert et al. 2003, Federhen et al. 2016). Names act as a system of metadata with which we can organize open distributed data in a biologically meaningful way, and as such they make larger scale studies possible. Projects such as LifeWatch, Atlas of Living Australia and especially Encyclopedia of Life rely on names to organize content (Fuentes and Fiore 2014, Patterson 2010). The Global Names Architecture is a vision to make a names-based cyberinfrastructure available for open and free use. Along with phylogenetic informatics (\u200bParr et al. 2012), molecular bioinformatics, ecoinformatics (Michener and Jones 2012), and ontologies (Bard and Rhee 2004), a names-based cyberinfrastructure will make possible collaborative projects that extend across the scope and scale of biology, and create new opportunities for discovery.",

They include incorrectly formed names, changes to the correct name for a taxon, or the use of the same name-string (the sequence of characters, digits, and spaces that makes up the name) for more than one taxon (Patterson et al. 2010). This has led to a collection of environments and tools (see Peng et al. 2012 for overview) and standard names-lists (e. g. Zermoglio et al. 2016) to help manage the use of names both as metadata and to prevent the use of names that are mis-spelled or no longer are endorsed as the correct name by any taxonomic authorities. The Global Names Architecture (GNA) is a vision for an underlying free and open names-based cyber-infrastructure that will provide services (such as confirming spelling, authority informationm or indicating if the name has been rendered into synonymy) to users of names by drawing on expert sources of taxonomic and nomenclatural knowledge and adding value to them with new tools and data management environments. Some of the GNA tools are included in this study, but not all contingencies have been addressed, nor are all tools developed to deliver production grade (aiming at 95% satisfaction) services as yet. GNA aims to be dynamic (see below) and to embrace differing views as to the correct name for a taxon - views that are held in \u2018Taxonomic Authority Files\u2019 (van den Berghe et al. 2015).",

Because of it, a search initiated with a single name-string may not find content that applies to a taxon because it was labelled with a different name. This problem has many causes. One is if species are moved to a different genus. The cryptophyte known as Chilomonas\nparamecium was moved to Cryptomonas when the species paramecium was found to have a sister group relationship with species within Cryptomonas (Hoef-Emden and Melkonian 2008). In response, the species was moved to Cryptomonas and a second name, Cryptomonas\nparamecium, was created for the same species. The new name is a homotypic (objective or nomenclatural) synonym of the first name (see glossary of terms). That is, additional names are created for the same taxon because of new taxonomic and phylogenetic insights.",

Triactinomyxon\ngyrosalmo and Myxosoma\ncerebralis are different life-history stages of the same species, a discovery that came long after the stages were described as separate species (Wolf and Markiw 1984). The two names are heterotypic (taxonomic or subjective) synonyms.

Scientific names are presented in a latinized form, are compliant with the relevant code of nomenclature, or, if the codes do not apply to them (for example, because they are names of high ranking taxa), they are written in a comparable form consistent with the expectations of biologists. Scientific names may include annotations, authors, and dates of nomenclatural acts. Code-compliance typically addresses the names of families, genera, subgenera, species and subspecies. This definition of scientific names is not consistent with the use of the same term by GenBank (see \"Results\" below). Other classes of 'names' include common names, also referred to as vernacular or colloquial names, are part of living languages, such as French, Tagalog, or Latvian. Another class of 'names' are surrogates that may be strain numbers, acronyms, or other strings that take the place of a name. Finally, taxa may be distinguished using identifiers in the form of short molecular sequences or barcodes, or with data identifiers such as LSIDs or UUIDs. This classification is inexact as, illustrated below, some name-strings include scientific elements, or may be part common names, part acronym, or part surrogate (here and elsewhere, examples of name-strings from this exercise are presented in bold):",

Kummerovia striata and Kummerowia striata are alternative spellings in the same source; and corbulasulcata is a concatenation of Corbula sulcata.

The Codes of Nomenclature seek to prevent homonyms by stipulating that when a name is used, it can never be used again for another taxon. However, given the number of species and the absence of comprehensive nomenclators, it is possible that one author inadvertently introduces as a new name one that has already been used. Dolium was introduced in 1990 for an unusual euglenid (Larsen and Patterson 1990), but had already been used for a mollusc (Lamarck 1801). As different Codes of Nomenclature apply to different areas of life, the same name may be legitimately used for taxa of plants and of animals (Peranema is a name for a fern and for a flagellate). Up to 15% of generic names are homonyms (IRMNG homonyms, McNeill 1997), but the number of species-level homonyms (e.g. Pieris\njaponica Shir\u00f4zu, 1952 - a butterfly, and Pieris\njaponica (Thunberg) D. Don ex G. Don - a flowering plant) is small (a few hundred) (IRMNG species homonyms). In the absence of agreement to use a unified code, transregnal homonyms will need to be disambiguated to avoid information on unrelated species being included among the results of a search using a homonymic name. Reference to authors, species names in the case of generic homonyms; and taxonomic or other context has the potential to achieve disambiguation.",

Notations are often absent such that the chresonym name-string is indistinbguishable in form from a scientific name (with author). The name of the South American water willow usually ascribed to Nicolaus von Jacquin is included in Catalogue of Life with the five different authors: Justicia carthagenensis Willd. ex Nees, Justicia charthaginensis L.

To sample the name-strings in DRYAD, about 200 data packages were chosen randomly for download. Each data package included one or more data files. Unique name-strings (scientific names only) were identified in all data files by two human annotators (Kappa agreement = 0.832).

One aim for this is to remove elements that show a lot of variation between lexical variants of the name-strings for the same species.

Onmce these are removed, differently presented versions of the same name found in different sources can be matched. There can be different versions of canonicalization. Complete canonicalization retains all of the latinized elements of the original name-string. Standard canonicalization retains only those elements that are required by the codes. The complete canonical of Aaleniella (Danocythere) is Aaleniella (Danocythere), whereas the standard canonical of the same name is Danocythere. In this analysis we relied on standard canonicals.",

As a result, it can identify Dorsophila melanogaster as being a variant of Drosophila melanogaster. It combines the Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm with heuristic rules designed specifically for scientific names to produce improved levels of recall, precision and execution time. The number of actions such as a character change, addition, deletion within the source name-string that leads to a match with a target name-string is referred to as 'Edit Distance'.

The process can involve full name-strings or canonical names by invoking parsing tools. Cross-mapper can be applied to checklists that are supplied in CSV-form from, for example, spreadsheet environments such as MS Excel, Apple Numbers, Open Office, Libre Office, and Google Sheets. We include a \u2018pre-processing\u2019 step with regular expressions that can be used to eliminate recurring idiosyncrasies in sources of names to produce standardized names. The business rules of pre-processing can be adapted to suit each source. Pre-processing was used to manage the content from DRYAD in which there were a large number of name-strings that were created by concatenation of genus and species elements of the name interpolated with another character such as \u2018_\u2019.

The name-string Canela can be fuzzily matched to the genus names Canelo or Canala, and from this information alone, we are unable to determine which is right. Matches of binomial or trinomial names, or of names with authorship information are more likely to be correct. Different authorships do not necessarily mean different taxonomic meaning. Monochamus\ngalloprovincialis (Olivier, 1795) and Monochamus\ngalloprovincialis Secchi, 1998 refer to the same species, the former including the original author of the basionym and the latter is a chresonym - a reference to the use of the name.

Points reflect features of name-strings which increase the likelihood of a correct match, and negative values to features that decrease it. For example, an exact match of a uninomial genus name (Erigeron) adds one point to give a confidence score of 0.75; a match of a binomial name (Erigeron altaicus with Erigeron altaicus Popov) increases the probability significantly, for which we add 3 points to give a confidence score of 0.988. A match with all of the author information (Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers.) adds a further point to give a confidence score of 0.999. However, if the authorship of the name did not match (e.g. Erigeron canadensis L. with Erigeron canadensis Brot.) we subtract 2 points, to give an overall confidence score of 0.75.

The integration of the identifiers as surrogates within a names-based infrastructure is achieved through algorithmic analysis of similarities to create bundles of identifiers that may correspond with species (BINs, Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013), and with the inferred phylogenetic (=taxonomic) location within a global classification scheme being achieved through analyses of molecular similarities (Hinchliff et al. 2015). Hinchcliff and colleagues provide a very extensive tree (dendrogram) that includes mostly the entities for which we have molecular data. In it, a large number of the \u2018tips\u2019 are not named species, but are entities labelled with molecular identifiers. It is unlikely that many such entities will be resolved to named species. This is most evident with prokaryotes. Given the exacting standards for code-compliance (i.e. availability in culture), a growing number of entities will either not be given any name, or will have interim names identified as such with the term \u2018candidatus\u2019 or other marker. It is urgent that molecular identifiers and names are managed together as alternative tokens for taxa, a point addressed for fungi by Schoch et al. (2014) and for bacteria by Federhen and colleagues (Federhen 2014, Federhen et al. 2016). In order to connect content attached to names to content associated with molecular identifiers, the integration process should include the mapping of molecular identifiers to species.

An alternative to reconciliation is the use of standardized names compilations as reference systems (Boyle et al. 2013, Zermoglio et al. 2016). Standardized lists promote consistency and provide gold-standard material for the last step in reconciliation - that of name resolution. While such lists may be useful, they are are expensive to maintain, do not address the problems associated with multiple points of view, nor address the management of now obsolete names in older documents, nor taxonomic concepts, nor the dynamic nature of taxonomies and phylogenies (Franz and Thau 2011). Standard lists need to be able to call on reconciliation and resolution to keep pace with name changes and name introductions. ",

The concatenations were addressed by pre-processing with regular expressions - with a dramatic improvement in cross-matching to other sources (Table 3). The library of expressions needs to be continuously improved as each new problem is identified. Other solutions include translation tables but such tables need to be included within reconciliation services of a names-based infrastructure. In addition to idiosyncrasies, about 400 name-strings relating to scientific names in DRYAD lacked the genus name (S hangoei and virescens). About one name-string in 20 in both GenBank and DRYAD contained no taxonomically useful information. As for the future, we see no benefits from the continued use of idiosyncratic versions of name-strings. Manual curation is tedious.

With the use of canonical versions of name-strings, chresonyms inflate the perceived matching of lists. Apparent chresonyms are instances of taxon+author combindations that do not refer to nomenclatural acts, and may, for example, because if subspecific taxa are excluded while the authors for those taxa are retained. As noted above, a junior synonym for the snake eyed skink from Mauritius, Ablepharus boutonii africanus, matched 15 variants of Ablepharus\nboutonii. 43,000 unique name-strings matched two or more names in Catalogue of Life. Some of these matches will result from canonical matching of species and subspecies, from errors in data entry, and there are a small number of instances of homonyms which match if canonical forms of names are used. Chresonyms have the potential of confusing reconciliation - as in examples where one name in Catalogue of Life is given as a synonym of two different species (Lacerta caucasica Engelmann Et Al., 1993 is indicated as a synonym of Darevskia\nalpina (Darevsky, 1967) and Darevskia\ndaghestanica (Darevsky, 1967)).

Most tools establish the existence of similar or different concepts on the basis of the taxonomic tree-path (parents), sister taxa, and subordinate taxa. The approach is sensitive to taxonomic completeness and conventions of sources under comparison. The use of concepts draws attention to finer granularity than can be achieved with names on their own. But, as different concepts with the same name overlap, the unambiguous definition of concepts by reference to defining characteristics will be needed if they are to be used in organizing biodiversity information. Yet, the characteristics that allow overlapping concepts to be distinguished are not codified in a standard way, are rarely specified, and, if accessible, can only be established with examination of taxonomic texts.

Firstly, the approach should be limited to canonical elements to eliminate the consequences of noise in author and date information. If edit distances greater than 1 are used, we should associate the more exacting result (Chiatherina sp. ZSM 34143 matches Iriatherina at a distance of 2, and Chilatherina at a distance of 1) with the confidence score when fuzzy matching hits more than one target. Under those circumstances, additional semantic elements (perhaps species and subspecific names or authority information) may be called on to evaluate the competing matches. Knowledge of Latin and Greek grammar - such as gender compliance - may be used to discriminate among results: Aphis citricida matched to Aphis citricidus, Aphis citricola Del Guercio, 1917, and Aphis citricola van der Goot, 1912.

At one end of the spectrum are instances in which all characters in a source name-string referring to a terminal taxon match a string in a target. Such matches may be the best, but could also be misleading. The increasing redistribution of digital names lists without any critical oversight may lead to matches among sources that have not verified the validity of the names. As an example, some recognize that the Global Names Index is not a source for taxonomically endorsed names, but others (e.g. http://marine.lifewatch.eu/belgian-lifewatch-e-lab) do treat it as a taxonomic database. Perfect matches may then be formed with other instances of the same mis-spelled name-strings or with chresonyms. Cross-checks against multiple taxonomically endorsed data sources or annotation (see below) are desirable to eliminate such matches. The next level of performance is a perfect match of the canonical versions of the terminal taxa. There is a small level of risk of homonyms (such as the examples of Asterina gibbosa and Baileya australis given above). Most homonyms have been listed in the IRMNG compilation and so can be converted into a reference vocabulary that the cross mapper can call upon to alert users to the possibility of a homonym. Less precise matching, from rank of genus and above is not useful if the agenda is to use names to interconnect data. Given the numbers of homonyms (McNeill 1997) canonical matches of generic names are likely to encounter homonym problems.",

We see the ideal system as one in which each annotatable object is assigned a Universally Unique Identifier, and annotation tools in the form of plug-ins for browsers (see NameSpotter discussion below) allow comments to be added to the identifiers. Reconciliation is likely to be required for items that have more than oner UUID. The annotation tools might be activated by mouse-overs or embedded in specialist editing environments. Annotations, once made, will be then compiled centrally, can accompany the data object, be made visible to the data source or supplier of the digital object, and may or may not automatically update the digital object. Annotation can be used to correct errors or add additional information. It provides a mechanism for quality control. It is an appealing solution because quality control based on users will target content in use. In the case of a names-based infrastructure, annotation could be used to confirm or reject the results of fuzzy and canonical matching, address matters relating to homonyms, correctly identify synonyms and distinguish them from chresonyms, link or remove names in reconciliation groups, better manage common names, and so on.
