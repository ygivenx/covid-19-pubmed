The BoV genome possesses three main open reading frames, ORF1-3, encoding the non-structural protein NS1, capsid protein VP1/2 and nuclear phosphoprotein NP1, respectively1. The BoVs have emerged and caused diseases in various animals and humans, including canine BoVs (CBoVs), porcine BoVs (PBoV), bovine parvovirus, gorilla BoV, California sea lion BoV, rodent BoV, feline BoVs (FBoVs) and human BoVs (HBoVs), and so suggests a potentially wide host range of BoVs1\u20133. Many researches have indicated the association of BoVs with various clinical symptoms. Respiratory and intestinal diseases have been observed frequently in BoV-infected hosts4, but other uncommon clinical presentations have also been reported. These include encephalomyelitis in a PBoV-infected pig, necrotizing encephalitis in HBoV-infected humans and hepatitis in CBoV-infected dogs5\u20137. Likewise, previous studies have reported the detection of the BoV genome in liver, lymph node, feces and blood of infected hosts, suggesting that BoVs could cause systemic infections2.",

Firstly, the novel FBoV-1 was detected in various samples, such as feces, blood, kidney and nasal swabs, collected from asymptomatic cats in Hong Kong1. Thereafter, FBoV-2 and \u22123 were discovered during high throughput metagenomic study of fecal viromes in healthy cats8,9. However, neither the pathological roles of these FBoVs associated with intestinal disease nor other systemic diseases have been established. To date, the emergence of FBoVs has been reported in Belgium, China, Japan, Portugal and USA8\u201313, where the FBoV genomes were detected in the feces of cats with and without clinical signs. Later, the FBoV-1 genome was detected in cats with severe enteritis12, but the relationship between FBoV-1 detection and clinical presentations with its pathogenesis in infected cats is still limited. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that the FBoV-1 genome was the most co-infected virus with other viral pathogens. For example, the FBoV-1 genome was detected in the brain of feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) infected cat showing neurological signs10. So far, the reports have addressed the potential role of FBoV-1 infections, yet the role of FBoV-1 when co-infected with FPLV is still unknown.",

Recombination allows viruses to quickly change their properties and results in novel genetic variants. For BoVs, genetic recombination has been focused on as a potential mechanism for virus evolution. For example, the evidence suggests that HBoV-3 emerged as a result of genetic recombination between HBoV-1 and HBoV-214. Likewise, the HBoV-4 genome carried the admixture genome between HBoV-2 and HBoV-315\u201317. Furthermore, homologous genetic recombination among CBoV-2 strains was also evident2. These findings indicated that genetic recombination is likely to play an important role in the diversity of BoVs.",

Genetic analysis of the full-length coding genome of the obtained Thai FBoV-1 strains indicated three separate strains (one per cat) and evidence of natural genetic recombination.

The phylogenetic tree of FBoV-1 revealed different two main clades (1 and 2), with the 19R81C- and 19R124C/THA/2019 strains in the first clade but separated into two separate subclades (1 A and 1B), while isolate 18R217C/THA/2018 was placed in the second clade and closely related to the FBoV-1 genomes detected in China (Fig. 3). The genetic relationship among the FBoV-1 was analyzed as a pairwise nucleotide identity map (Fig. 4).

However, clinical presentations of hemorrhagic syndrome with multi-systemic involvement are atypical findings for simple FPLV infections. Thus, an unknown concurrent infectious etiology, highly likely viral, may have played an important role in these outbreaks. This prompted us to expand the search for other unknown pathogens.

The FBoV-1 viral genomes have been previously detected in both cats with and without diarrhea1,11,12, but the pathological roles and viral localization are still debatable. In this study, the presence of FBoV-1 associated with these outbreaks was confirmed by the PCR from various fresh tissues of the moribund cats and fecal swabs from cats in the same households. Furthermore, the FBoV-1 localization and distribution were documented by ISH analysis, suggesting the extent of infection and viral tropism. Detection of FBoV-1 DNA using PCR showed the patterns of viral distribution. However, the demonstration of FBoV-1 in and other organs of moribund cats by PCR, in the absence of FBoV-1 ISH signal outside the intestinal tract and lymphoid tissues, was inconsistent, suggesting the possibility of viral spread via the blood stream. This finding was consistent with previous publications that documented the evidence of bocaviral viremia in the absence of viral localizations2,18. Since various BoVs were identified in intestinal tract of humans and other animals, with and without clinical diseases, investigations of FBoV-1 were recently conducted in intestinal tract samples of cats1,8,9,11\u201313. However, the role of FBoV-1 enteric disease is not fully yet investigated. To better understanding the role of FBoV-1 associated with intestinal lesions, substantiation of virus localization in tissue and association of histological features are important. In the present of study, the FBoV-1 genomic signals were localized mainly in the nucleus of cryptal epithelium, intestinal stromal supporting cells and rarely detected in epithelium of villi. This finding indicated the first identification of FBoV-1 localization in the intestinal tissues and supported the previous evidences suggesting the FBoV-1 is more prevalent in fecal samples. This finding also indicated the common features of bocaparvoviral infection associated with intestinal diseases. Furthermore, the FBoV-1 signals were also detected in endothelium of small-sized blood vessels at intestinal submucosa and serosa, suggesting another possible evidence of FBoV-1 spread via the blood stream. Of note, the detection of FBoV-1 in many tissues would argue it is possible to be a persistent virus in cats, whether in blood or specifically in the tissues, as recent studies of persistent infection of BoVs19\u201321. Therefore, in this present study, a contributory role of FBoV-1 enteric disease is possible while a role of FBoV-1 viremia is needed further studies of FBoV-1 pathogenesis.",

However, the FPLV antigen was only detected at a low level in the mesenteric lymphoid tissue, while FBoV-1 antigens were detected at a large-scale, particularly in the necrotic areas of both the cortex and medulla of the lymph nodes. The presence of FBoV-1 antigens was not limited to mesenteric lymph nodes but was also systemically spread through the various lymphoid organs. The presence of FPLV and FBoV-1 antigens may also reflect the time point of infection, as the FPLV antigen might be cleared after necrosis of the lymphoid tissue. In addition, FBoV-1 may be associated with the lymphoid necrosis itself similar to reports of bocapavovirus infection in various host species18,22. These results support that the pathological role of FBoV-1 can be associated with lymphoid necrosis, as reported previously, and may contribute to the acquired immunodeficient state of the host18,23,24. The role of immunocompromise situation, as FPLV infection in theses cats, may induce secondary viremia or vice versa. As such, hosts with FBoV infection are likely to be more susceptible to other infectious diseases. Subsequent systemic immunosuppression might allow the virulent bacteria to colonize in tissues and, therefore, contributed to lesions in other organs. In vivo study of the FBoV-1 infection may demonstrate the exact role of FBoV-1 in the focused diseases.",

A recent study showed that BoV can induce a DNA damage response (DDR) for cellular infection20,25\u201327, and the fact that parvovirus has limited its genetic resource and requires the DDR process to facilitate its replication process26,28. Thus, the association of BoV infection with enhanced parvovirus replication has been reported29, while vice versa, parvovirus can also induce the DDR process26,28 and help BoV infection27. Thus, we hypothesized the possible synergistic effect of FPLV and FBoV-1 infection in this study. Alternatively, many current studies have revealed that BoV causes not only acute infections but also probable persistent or subclinical infections by forming the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) structure and integrating into the host genome21,30,31. Furthermore, the BoVs have been associated with lymphoid necrosis18,23,24 and may be a primary persistent infection resulting in immunosuppression, allowing secondary infection with FPLV, despite previous vaccination. In this study, the role of FBoV-1 infections remains elusive, whether primary or secondary. Nevertheless, experimental study of such dual infections is needed to further clarify the true significance of the FBoV-1 infections.",

Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic hemorrhage of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of FBoV-1 associated with enteric disease is possible. Since antigens/nucleic acid of the FPLV, but not those of other viruses, were detected in tissues of diseased cats, the clinical presentations are likely synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1, arguing the causative role of FBoV1 in the disease progression. Thus, we speculate the synergistic effects of dual infections with FBoV-1 and FPLV, ultimately resulting in a more severe and sudden clinical disease. The genetic recombination of FBoV-1 is firstly identified in this study, supporting the evolutionary mechanism of BoVs. Further in-depth studies of the pathology of the FBoV-1 infection are required to fully elucidate the significant clinical presentation of infected cats and to provide optimal guidance for diagnosis, surveillance and quarantine of FBoV-1 suspected cats. Further applied studies should be undertaken into FBoV-1 protein functions, to better understand how recombination events alter FBoV-1 pathogenesis and transmission.",

Bonferroni correction was set as the default setting. The alignment of each detected FBoV-1 sequence with those available in GenBank was used as the template for genetic recombination analysis. Any potential recombination event that was detected by at least four methods was considered to be a potential recombinant44,45. Major and minor parents of the potential recombinant detected in the RDP were further analyzed using a similarity plot and bootscan analysis in the SimPlot software package v. 3.5.146. The recombinant genome derived from the RDP analysis was used as the query sequence. The recombination analysis was conducted with a window size of 200 bp and step size of 20 bp. The recombination breakpoints were identified and analyzed by the Kimura-2 parameter (K2P) model for bootscan analysis and the GapStrip model for the similarity plot. A phylogeny of the detected recombination region was then constructed in order to confirm the suggested recombination. The ML phylogenetic tree construction criteria and procedure were conducted as described in the analysis of the complete coding genome.

Examined tissues included the brain, lung, heart, tongue, stomach, small and large intestine, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The DNA probe covering 133 bp of the NS1 gene of FBoV-1 was prepared using a PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The PCR reaction was performed under the same thermal cycling conditions described earlier using the described NS1 primers1 except using the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligonucleotides instead of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. Validation of the hybridization probe was performed by size resolution on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and using control DNA for Northern blot immunolabelling (not shown). The ISH with chromogenic DNA was performed as previously reported47, with minor modification. Briefly, each 4-\u00b5m-thick FFPE slide was deparaffinized, rehydrated and subsequently rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Thereafter, the slides were treated with proteinase K (200 \u00b5g/mL; VWR, Radnor, USA) in prewarmed PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Slides were then washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. In order to eliminate the endogenous alkaline phosphatase, cold 20% (v/v) acetic acid were applied on each slid for 20 sec, and the slides were soaked with PBD 3 times for 5 min each then dried at room temperature. Thereafter, all slides were then prehybridized in hybridization buffer [50% (v/v) formamide, 6X SSC, 5X Denhardt\u2019s solution, 100 \u00b5g/mL DNA, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate] at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min. Meanwhile place on ice. Fifty ul of hybridization buffer containing probes for FBoV-1 were applied on each slide while hybridization buffer containing DIG-labeled feline herpesvirus probe was placed on each negative control slide. The slides were then transferred to a humidified chamber and further incubated at 37 \u00b0C for overnight. Then slides were soaked in the series of buffer standard saline citrate including 2X SSC at pH 7.0\u20137.4 and 1X SSC at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min of each and 0.5X SSC at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. For blocking nonspecific binding, all slides were flooded with blocking solution mixture composed of 1 ml blocking solution and 9 ml of Maleic acid buffer (DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), then were incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The slides were subsequently rinsed by 20 mM Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. After nonspecific blocking, 100 ul of anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (1:200 in 1X Blocking solution) were placed on each slides, and the slides were incubated in the moist chamber for 60 min at room temperature, then washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, and placed in detection buffer (DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 5 min. Liquid permanent red (LPR) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied in the dark room at room temperature for 30 min.
