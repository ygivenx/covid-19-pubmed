            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major agents that causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and young children, which is characterized by fever, ulcers in the oral mucosa and vesicles on the hands and feet1. Although EV71 infection in most cases is self-limited, it can also induce severe neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis (AM), encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis (BE), pulmonary edema (PE) and other rarer manifestations1. These neurological complications can sometimes lead to permanent neurologic sequelae and even death, and fatal PE or cardiorespiratory failure is thought be the main disease process in fatal cases1. It has also been postulated that dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cellular immunity are possibly responsible for this pathogenesis2\u20134. For instance, an in vitro study conducted by Lu et al. showed that EV71 inhibited the cellular type I IFN response by targeting a subunit of the IFN receptor, IFNAR12. An animal study revealed that both the lymphocyte and antibody responses reduced the mortality and tissue viral loads of EV71-infected mice3. In a clinical study, it was shown that elevated cytokine production (including IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3) and lymphocyte (including CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, natural killer cells) depletion were responsible for EV71 infection4. Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective vaccines or therapy available for EV71 infection. Therefore, developing a better understanding of the neuropathogenesis of EV71 infection is of the utmost importance in developing a more effective clinical therapy for treating HMFD patients.",

            "text": "Chemokines are a group of small secreted proteins that have been shown to induce directed chemotaxis in response to inflammation5. The most investigated chemokines belong to the CC and CXC families, which are classified by the relative position of the first consensus cysteines (either separated by a non-conserved amino acid or next to each other). CC chemokines include regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, also termed CCL5) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also termed CCL2), while interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, also termed CXCL10), monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG, also termed CXCL9) and interleukin-8 (IL-8, also termed CXCL8) belong to the CXC family5. Although they were initially characterized as being important in inflammation by targeting leukocytes, chemokines are now considered to be crucial mediators that play fundamental roles in both the physiological and pathological immune responses5. For example, the concentration of RANTES is higher in patients with a bacterial infection (including sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia, skin abscess) than controls with no infection, indicating that RANTES may be involved in the pathogenesis of bacteria6. In the same study, a unique pattern of immune response with high levels of IP-10 but low levels of MCP-1 were found in patients with sepsis6. IP-10, MIG and IL-8 were significantly elevated in the sputum of asthma patients compared to healthy controls7. Similarly, the plasma levels of IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and IL-8 were significantly higher in patients with PE than those with uncomplicated BE, indicating overexpression of the chemokine cascade, which appears to play an important role in the immune response to EV71 infection8. However, few studies have evaluated the levels of chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HMFD children. Additionally, encephalitis is the common neurological complication of EV71 infection; little is known about the roles of chemokines in encephalitis, and the key mediators underlying this inflammatory response remain unclear. Moreover, despite the severe consequences, early recognition of HFMD patients with neurological complications is important for selecting optimal intensive care, which might prevent disease progression.",

When the cut-off point of MIG was 2.10 pg/ml, its sensitivity and specificity were 67.7% and 100%, respectively (Fig. 4c). Similarly, IL-8, RANTES and MCP-1 had 58.6%, 56.6% and 62.6% sensitivity, and 95.5%, 95.5% and 81.8% specificity, when the optimal cut-off values were 52.71 pg/ml, 1.26 pg/ml and 97.24 pg, respectively (Fig. a,b,d). Subsequently, a combination marker of these five chemokines was evaluated by ROC analysis, which had an area under the ROC curve of 0.953 (Table 2). Its sensitivity and specificity were 89.9% and 95.5%, respectively (Fig. 4f). Hence the diagnostic efficiency of the combination marker was superior to that of the single chemokine.",

In the present study, the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 were found to be significantly changed in the CSF of HFMD patients in the acute stage of EV71-related encephalitis (Fig. 1). Our finding suggests that chemokines, which function in the selective recruitment of leukocyte populations, are involved in the pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) EV71 infection. The increased expression levels of IL-8, IP-10 and MIG are consistent with those of previous studies8,11. In addition, we found chemokines that were correlated with each other (Fig. 5), in accordance with the result of string bioinformatics analysis12, which showed that these chemokines act in cooperation with each other rather than alone (Supplementary Fig. S1). Likewise, a cytokine storm has been considered to be the main trigger of EV71-related cardiopulmonary collapse13. Taken together, this evidence implied that the dysregulation of the chemokine cascade in the CNS appears to be important regarding the elicitation of the inflammatory response to EV71 infection.",

MIG and IP-10 are Th1 cell attractants, while MCP-1 is Th2 chemokine and RANTES can recruit both Th1 and Th2 cells5. Previous studies have shown that HFMD is a Th1-driven disease4,9. In line with this finding, we also showed that Th1 chemotactic factors (including MIG, IP-10 and RANTES), rather than MCP-1, are potent chemoattractants of Th2 and are significantly elevated in the acute phase. Thus, we assumed that increased CSF MIG, IP-10 and RANTES in children with encephalitis may result in enhancement of Th1 lymphocyte recruitment into the CNS. Accordingly, decreased expression of the Th2 chemokine MCP-1 in encephalitis patients may contribute to a diminished antagonizing effect on Th1 cytokine production and hence intensify Th1 predominance. Interestingly, we revealed that MIG, IP-10 and RANTES were decreased in the recovery phase, while no significant differences were observed for MCP-1. Together, these data imply that Th1 chemoattractants predominate after EV71 infection and contribute to host defense by promoting a protective Th1 response.",

            "text": "MIG and IP-10 are IFN-inducible CXC chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for activated T cells, memory T cells and natural killer cells by signaling through the CXCR3 receptor14. This could explain why MIG was strongly and positively correlated with IP-10, reflecting a temporal co-operation between CXCR3 ligands. An abundance of data demonstrated that MIG and IP-10 are induced in a diverse spectrum of neuroimmune diseases that influence the CNS14. Shen et al. observed that overexpression of IP-10 increased the MIG levels, reduced the viral burden in multiple tissues and increase the survival of mice after EV71 infection15. Consistently, IP-10 and MIG were significantly increased in the present study. Since chemokines are produced by CNS cells within hours of infection5, we suppose that the increased chemokine levels in patients with encephalitis may mediate early regulation and recruitment of protective immunity, reducing tissue damage. Likewise, it was reported that IP-10(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had reduced MIG levels that failed to control viral replication in the brain16. Kuang Y et al. showed that IP-10 enhanced the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and attenuation of rabies virus (RABV)17. This evidence suggests that early expression of IP-10 or MIG within the CNS after virus infection is important in initiating and maintaining a protective immune response. However, it has been implicated that herpes simplex virus (HSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can aggravate disease18\u201320. In detail, exaggerated activation of IP-10 and MIG have been proposed to be associated with adverse outcomes (intensive care unit admission or death) of SARS18. Increased secretion of IP-10 in the eye facilitates the spread of HSV to other restricted sites within the eye20. IP-10 regulates the severity of the LCMV-induced inflammatory process, resulting in fatal meningoencephalitis19. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that IP-10/MIG have subtle and perhaps divergent roles in different virus infection.",

Similarly, a previous study showed that the CSF to plasma ratio for MIG tended to increase with the increasing severity of disease and that the CSF IP-10 levels in patients with EV71 BE were significantly higher than the plasma levels in control subjects8. Moreover, no established antiviral treatment is available for HFMD. Therefore, our results indicated that IP-10 and MIG might be novel biomarkers to diagnose encephalitis, which may guide patient treatment in clinical practice. Although, the significant difference of IP-10 and MIG had been determined in the CSF, the number of detected cases was not large enough to have power as a solo diagnostic biomarker for encephalitis. Moreover, we performed ROC analysis to analyze the diagnostic efficiency of the markers for encephalitis and showed that the sensitivities of CSF IP-10 and MIG were low (67.7% and 67.7%). However, the combination marker of the five chemokines had a significant elevation of the area under the ROC of 0.953, and its sensitivity in detecting encephalitis was 89.9%. Therefore, the combination of these five chemokines could be applied to clinical diagnosis of encephalitis, which may potentially serve to monitor disease progression, and guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

Similarly, Wang et al. showed that the ratio of mean CSF to plasma levels for MCP-1 tended to fall with increasing disease severity8. These results suggest that MCP-1 may contribute to the overwhelming disease process. Inversely, it was shown that the plasma MCP levels elevated with increasing disease severity8. This could be explained by the difference in the immune response between the systemic and local inflammatory response. Interesting, although the MCP-1 levels decreased in convalescence, there was no statistically significant difference of the MCP-1 levels between the acute and recovery phases. This may be associated with the small paired sample size. To better elucidate this aspect, it would be interesting to determine the MCP-1 levels over a larger scale and at more than one time-point.",

Importantly, the results of the correlation and ROC curve analyses indicated that CSF IP-10 and MIG may have clinical diagnostic values in encephalitis. Additionally, further studies are needed to validate whether IP-10 and MIG could be therapeutic targets for EV71 infection. Thus, our findings provide important insights into the roles of some chemokines in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection.",
