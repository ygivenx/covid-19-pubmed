The first epidemic occurred in the spring of 2013 in eastern China [1, 2], while the second epidemic occurred over the winter of 2013\u201314 in eastern and southern China. As of 12 January 2015, there have been 490 laboratory-confirmed cases of human H7N9 infection and 188 deaths while the detection of a small number of mild cases in sentinel surveillance system implies that the true number of human infections is likely to be much greater than the reported laboratory-confirmed cases [3]. More than 80% of the confirmed H7N9 cases reported exposure to live poultry or a live poultry market (LPM) prior to symptom onset [1]. Because the H7N9 virus has low pathogenicity in poultry, unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, it is challenging to control the transmission of H7N9 from poultry to humans. LPMs were closed in the cities with H7N9 cases reported and/or environmental specimens testing positive for H7N9 during the spring 2013 and winter 2013\u201314 epidemics. Permanent closure of LPMs has been proposed in some of the cities affected by H7N9 [4, 5].",

Given the geographical differences observed in laboratory-confirmed cases in the two H7N9 waves, in this study we aimed to investigate patterns and changes in live poultry exposure, risk perceptions and attitudes towards H7N9, and preventive interventions adopted by the public in rural and urban areas of Guangdong province in southern China which was heavily affected during the winter 2013\u201314 epidemic.",

Human infection with H7N9 was associated with exposure to live poultry or LPMs from epidemiological investigations on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases for risk factors during the first wave in 2013 [1, 2, 10, 11]. A small number of H7N9 cases were reported in the spring 2013 epidemic in Guangdong province where our surveys were conducted while more cases were reported during the second epidemic in winter 2013\u201314 (Fig 1), indicating higher transmission of H7N9 during that period. The declining exposure to live poultry and LPMs in urban subjects in the second wave compared to the first wave was consistent with greater worry among respondents (Table 1), leading to changes in protective behaviors such as less visits to LPMs and less purchase of live poultry (Table 2) while there was a seasonal increase in poultry demand due to the Spring Festival in both urban and rural China from the late January to the early February. Nevertheless, exposure to live poultry was still common in both epidemics.",

The inconsistency between the higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection and the unchanged poultry exposure in rural subjects implied that decision-making on raising backyard poultry might not be driven by these factors although contact with live poultry or virus-contaminated objects was regarded as the possible routes of H7N9 transmission by most of rural subjects (Table 1). Changes in raising backyard poultry in the rural area was different from patterns observed in the urban area on live poultry exposure in both waves possibly implying that circulation of H7N9 virus in rural backyard poultry was less than that detected in urban LPMs.",

Reduction of live poultry exposure reported by urban subjects in two surveys to some extent reflected the effect of market closure although poultry demands usually increase during the Chinese Lunar New Year and the change in live poultry contact could also be due to increased risk perception to the virus in the public or seasonal variation in poultry exposure. Around one third of urban respondents supported closure of LPMs in both surveys (Table 1) despite much more proximal risk in the second survey, during the winter 2013\u201314 epidemic when many cases were reported in Guangzhou. Perceived susceptibility was not a significant predictor of support for LPM closure (Table 2).",

As with all observational studies, our findings may have been affected by reporting biases such as recall bias or social desirability bias, the latter occurring if respondents provided answers that they considered to be more desirable than the truth. Because we used telephone surveys in urban areas and face-to-face interviews in rural areas, and responses may differ depending on the mode of data collection, we avoided direct quantitative comparisons between the two settings. Our present study focused on an urban and rural area in southern China, and the findings may not generalize to other parts of China.",

A minority of urban respondents supported permanent LPM closure. Further efforts are needed to protect public health if H7N9 re-emerges in a third epidemic in the winter of 2014\u201315.",
