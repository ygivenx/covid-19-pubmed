The competition asked entrants to forecast the timing, peak, and disease incidence of the 2013\u20132014 influenza season using Twitter or other Internet data to supplement ILI weekly reported data. The work described in this paper was conducted as an entry for this competition. The CDC challenge concluded on March 27th, 2014. Though individual entries\u2019 scores were not announced, the winner was. Officials conducting the contest found each entry informative as to the capabilities of disease modeling to inform public policy but the general consensus was that the current state of influenza forecasting still has too much uncertainty to base public health policy on. Details of the contest will be announced in a forthcoming paper by the CDC [12]. Based on our entry to this contest, we present a novel method to provide a probabilistic forecast of the influenza season based on a mathematical model for seasonal influenza dynamics and historical U.S. influenza observations. The forecast is dynamically adjusted using a statistical filter as current influenza data is observed.",

It is necessary to have a historical record of these observations in order to asses the relation between the forecasting model and the data source. Our primary data source, ILINet, is the CDC\u2019s outpatient influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system [6, 14]. ILINet data represent the collection of outpatient data from over 3,000 hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices across the U.S. Each week, these locations report the total number of patient visits and the number of those visits that were seen for ILI, defined as fever (temperature \u2265 100\u00b0F) and a cough or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. Since 2003, these data have been collected weekly, year-round. ILINet data make up one portion of the CDC\u2019s complete influenza surveillance efforts. For example, U.S. influenza-related mortality and virological strain data are also collected, but they are not used in this study. For a complete overview of the CDC\u2019s influenza surveillance programs we refer the reader to [6, 7, 14].",

However, ILI represents a limited syndromic observation of people who seek medical attention each week [7, 10]. Furthermore, the distribution and specific reporting practices of the approximately 3,000 healthcare providers involved in ILINet, the lack of care-seeking for many individuals infected with influenza, and the possibility of ILI symptoms without infection from the influenza virus complicates the understanding of the relation between a reported level of ILI and actual U.S. influenza prevalence. An additional drawback is related to the bureaucratic hierarchy of the ILI system; there is a 1\u20132 week lag present in data availability.",

These two properties are informed by both the inherent model dynamics and current observations of flu. Fortunately for epidemiologists, the methodology for generating probabilistic forecasts with a deterministic mathematical model based on observed data has been well developed in climatology, meteorology, and oceanography [20\u201322]. We demonstrate how the ensemble Kalman smoother, can be used to iteratively update a distribution of the influenza model\u2019s initial conditions and parameterizations. An advantage of our technique is that it retains information about when the model dynamics systematically diverge from the dynamics of observations. The systematic model divergence from observed influenza dynamics will be used as a basis for future research in model discrepancy to improve forecasts.",

However, this capability is still in its infancy in the field of public health. For more complete literature reviews on the field, we refer the reader to [23, 24]. Briefly, we present the literature on epidemic forecasting influencing this work, all of which rely on a Bayesian viewpoint to adjust an underlying disease model given incoming observations [25]. First, disease forecasting methods that use data to parameterize an underlying causal model of disease can use either sequential Monte Carlo type methods [14, 26\u201331] or ensemble methods [32\u201335]. Some work has been done on comparing the two methods [36, 37]. There are also several works of a more statistical nature [38\u201343], one that relies on a pure Kalman filter [44], and one that uses variational assimilation methods [45]. Of these works, the majority tune a differential equation-based compartmental disease model [26, 28\u201330, 32, 33, 36, 37, 45]. However, some forecasts have been formed using agent based simulations [27, 31, 41] or spatial models [34, 35].",

Using the MapReduce programming paradigm [46], we aggregate these hourly requests into weekly access counts and normalize the total number of accesses per article using the total requests for all articles across the entire English Wikipedia in each week. Wikipedia access logs have been studied extensively in [15, 16], and we refer the reader to these sources for thorough analyses of the data. In short, it was shown that for a range of infectious diseases across many countries, some articles have access rates that are highly correlated with public health infectious disease records.

To select these articles, we used the simple article selection procedure described in [15]: we first gathered access log time series for relevant articles linked to from the main influenza Wikipedia article [47], including the main influenza article itself. This totaled approximately 50 articles. The correlation between each of the 50 article access log time series and U.S. ILI data was computed. It was found that access log time series from the five articles mentioned above were much more highly correlated with the ILI data than the remaining articles, so it was decided that only these five articles would be used. It is important to note that only examining this restricted set of 50 Wikipedia access logs will inevitably leave the potential for the existence of an un-investigated article that is highly correlated with ILI data. However, barring an exhaustive search of Wikipedia articles focusing on the articles linked from the main English influenza article seemed like a reasonable choice.",

This forms our regression vector X = (1, x\n1, x\n2, \u2026, x\n5, ILI\n\u22121).

Fig 1 shows the regression from the 5 Wikipedia access logs and the previous week ILI to historical ILI data.

It is important to note here that the access logs and historical ILI observations used as regressors do not exist on the same scale and therefore it is not correct to use these coefficients to infer importance of the various terms as predictors of ILI. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the individual Wikipedia access logs are not independent or uncorrelated with each other.",

For this reason, it was necessary to define a fixed maximum possible length influenza season that would include the earliest possible ramp up of the flu season and the latest possible tapering off. By examining the ILI data for the entire U.S. from the 2002\u20132003 season to the 2012\u20132013 season, it was found that influenza incidence does not start to noticeably increase until at least epidemiological week 32 (mid-August). Moreover, once the influenza peak has passed, the incidence decreases to non-epidemic levels by at least epidemiological week 20 (mid-May). To illustrate our maximal flu season\u2019s relation to historical ILI data we have included Fig 2 with our flu season highlighted. The exception to our maximal influenza season range is the the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which emerged in the late 2008\u20132009 season causing this season to be prolonged and an early start in 2009\u20132010 season. With the flu season defined to be between epidemiological week 32 and epidemiological week 20, even the 2009 H1N1 emergence is mostly accounted for. We emphasize that our definition of a fixed maximal influenza season allows us to avoid modeling influenza prevalence during the dormant summer months, a task which would require some re-introduction of susceptible individuals into the population. It is possible that, through modeling the increase of the susceptible population over the summer months or the change in distinct influenza strains the definition of an influenza season could be made unnecessary.",

Since there is usually a single dominant strain each flu season, we assumed that recovered individuals are then immune to the disease for the remainder of the season. In practice, this assumption is not entirely accurate since an individual that contracted and recovered from one strain can get infected from a different strain in the same season [56]. Indeed, in the 2013\u20132014 influenza season, an elevated level of ILI was maintained well after the primary peak. Upon investigation of World Health Organization and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (WHO/NREVSS) strain subtyping data this elevated level correlated with the emergence of influenza B as a secondary dominant strain. We still believe the presentation of our results using a single strain model to be informative especially since one will always have to weigh the cost of model parameter explosion, which can confound identifiability of the model from data with model complexity. After all, an influenza model with no spatial heterogeneity and n strains would consist of 2n\u22121(n+2) independent equations [60] compared to the three independent equations we must identify in (2).",

Data assimilation has been successful in a diverse array of fields, from meteorology [20, 21] to economics [22] but has only recently begun to be applied to disease spread [28\u201330, 32, 33, 35\u201337]. One of the most common schemes for data assimilation is based on the Kalman filter in which both the model error and observation error are assumed to be Gaussian and all mathematical models are assumed to be linear. Updating the model using observations is then accomplished by conditioning a joint Gaussian distribution. In particular, the ensemble Kalman filtering methods we use here, explained in detail below, have been successfully applied to non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations with a much higher degree of non-linearity and a much higher dimension than our S\n\u03bd\nEIR model [63\u201365]. Our approach to using Kalman filtering to estimate the underlying parameters of our model is more difficult than an estimation of the state of the system.

This gives a common time frame for each of the historical data sets. Then, at each of these common time points, the average and standard deviation of the historical observations can be computed. Thus, the straw man forecast consists of a normal distribution at each corresponding time point in the forecast with an averaged mean and standard deviation.

This was done following the methods described above. An example fit using a stochastic optimization algorithm to find 10 approximate solutions to (9) for the 2006\u20132007 ILI data is shown in Fig 4. Two things can be noticed from this fit of our epidemiological model. First, there is often a small early peak in the ILI data before the primary peak and our model does a poor job of capturing this. In several conversations we\u2019ve had with experts, the hypothesis has been put forward that the double peak in U.S. ILI data is due to under reporting during the holiday season in the U.S. However, from our observations the first peak can vary in its timing substantially and does not seem to be always present or strongly correlated with the holidays or emergence of separate influenza strains. Second, the ILI data usually remain elevated longer than our model\u2019s realizations can support. Under retrospective examination of the tail for the 2013\u20132014 season, the extended elevated ILI level appears to be due to the emergence of a secondary dominant strain. Further examination of this phenomenon using historical ILI data is necessary but beyond the scope of this study. Both of these areas point to systematic divergence of the model from data. It is always possible that our model fit is representative of influenza prevalence but, due to bias in the ILI reporting, diverges from the historical data. However, without a stronger ground truth dataset to support this, such hypotheses are difficult to test.",

This gives us a convenient weekly summary of our influenza forecast with uncertainty quantified by 50% and 90% posterior credible intervals about the median. It is important to clarify that, since we are adjusting the underlying parameterization and initialization of the S\n\u03bd\nEIR model and not the state of the model directly, the median and credible intervals for quantities such as the start week of the elevated ILI season continue to be adjusted even after they are observed. It is important to report these adjustments as they show how later observations effect the model\u2019s dynamics throughout the entire season. For example, we can observe that the enKS applied to the S\n\u03bd\nEIR model in the later ILI season tries to maintain an elevated ILI level by pushing the simulated peak forward in time. In practical application, the forecast of quantities such as the start week would be fixed once they were observed.",

The straw man\u2019s forecast does not assimilate current observations and thus its predicted start week is constant. Two things should be mentioned about calculating these credible intervals for the straw man forecast. First, since a sample from the straw man forecast has no week-to-week correlations, the weekly forecasts can vary greatly from week to week. This is a problem when computing the start week for the influenza season since a given straw man sample does not remain above 2% for consecutive weeks. Second, for similar reasons the duration cannot even be defined for one time series sample of the straw man forecast. The lack of correlations in week-by-week forecasts in the straw man model severely restricts its usefulness in influencing public health policy. For example, even after the 2013\u20132014 ILI data had been observed to decrease over the course of five weeks the straw man\u2019s median prediction was increasing. This makes it difficult to use to interpret the dynamics of influenza progression. On the other hand, even though the S\n\u03bd\nEIR model has significant errors in the forecast after the peak the trend of decreasing ILI is in agreement.",

The method used a dynamic compartmental model of influenza spread that has been used in previous research [51, 52, 54] but is applicable to any compartmental model of disease with a regularly updated public health data source. Though the flu forecasting system we have presented here is not ready to entirely base public health policy on, the methods provide a valuable framework. In particular, this framework provides real-time model testing, model dependent prior estimation, evaluation of probabilistic disease forecasting, and transitioning from a deterministic model to a probabilistic forecast. Moreover, if prior to the peak our model predicts an unexpected change in the future number of cases, then this is an indication to public health decision makers that the model may be picking up on hidden events and trends that are being missed by more traditional statistical prediction methods. In this regard, the model forecast is similar to having another expert viewpoint available during the decision process that can identify trends that might have otherwise been missed.",

However, a disease model that links spatial spread in each of these regions would have significantly more parameters to determine in a prior distribution.

This forecast does not include any causal model of influenza spread. There is, therefore, no correlation between the forecast at successive time points. This is seen when sampling time series from this forecast (right). The lack of correlation in forecasts for successive weeks severely limits the usefulness of such a forecast for public health decision making. For instance, after the 2013\u20132014 ILI peak was observed a further ILI peak is forecast to be just as likely six weeks later.",

The M-distance between the forecast and ILI data is calculated for each epidemiological week until the end of the influenza season. The M-distances at week 36 uses the forecast observations from week 36 of 2013 to week 20 of 2014 and the ILI data from week 36 of 2013 to week 20 of 2014. The M-distances plotted for the straw man prediction use sample covariances and means calculated from 300 time series draws of the straw man forecast. Due to the lack of causal relations included in the straw man model this measure of accuracy is significantly lower in the early season for the straw man prediction. This figure shows that the data assimilation forecast has a noticeably smaller M-distance, and therefore is quantitatively better, than the straw man model for the early influenza season. Once the influenza season peaks the success of the forecast breaks down due to model error. It is interesting to note that due to the enKS data assimilation our S\n\u03bd\nEIR forecast seems to attempt self-correction, i.e. the M-distance is increasing and then decreases.",

Here we see that up to a month before the peak of ILI the use of a mathematical influenza model with data assimilation provides up to a 20% improvement in the forecast with a minimum of a 10% improvement. However, this improvement is quickly degraded due to model bias close to the peak. It is notable that after the peak is observed the data assimilation attempts to correct the model but can not make up for the S\n\u03bd\nEIR model\u2019s strong tendency to a zero infected state after the peak.",

This causes an overestimation of the start week that worsens as the season progresses. In practice, once the start week has been observed the forecast would be fixed.
