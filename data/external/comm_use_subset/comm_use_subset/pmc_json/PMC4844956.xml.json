            "text": "In order to identify the direct interaction partners of the HEV macro domain, a GAL4 transcription factor based Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H) assay was designed. Two different host strains (Y2H gold and Mav203) were used to perform the assays. Y2H gold contains 4 independent reporters: AUR1-C [confers resistance to Aureobasidin A (Ar+)], HIS3 [permits growth on histidine deficient (H\u2212) medium], ADE2 [permits growth on Adenine deficient (A\u2212) medium] and MEL1 [codes for \u03b1-galactosidase, which produces blue color in the presence of X- \u03b1-gal]. These reporters are expressed upon successful interaction between the BD and the AD fusion proteins. Two different methods were followed to evaluate the interaction between the bait and the prey proteins in Y2H Gold: (a) replica plating of the cotransformants into histidine deficient growth medium containing increasing quantities of 3-AT (3-amino 1,2,4-triazole), a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (encoded by the HIS3 reporter gene), which catalyzes the sixth step in histidine biosynthesis pathway. If two proteins interact with high affinity, more imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase is produced, which requires higher quantity of 3-AT to be inhibited. Therefore, ability of the cotransformants to grow on increasing amount of 3-AT reflects the strength of interaction of the test proteins. Growth of the colonies were monitored after 3 days of replica plating and relative growth was scored in a scale of \u201c+\u201d to \u201c+++\u201d where +, ++ and +++ indicates poor, average and strong growth, respectively. (b) Quantitative estimation of \u03b1-galactosidase activity (encoded by the MEL1 reporter gene) by performing a liquid \u03b1-galactosidase assay in vitro in the presence of its substrate p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-galactoside. Mav203 contains HIS3 [permits growth on H\u2212 medium], URA3 [permits growth on Uracil deficient (U\u2212) medium] and lacZ [codes for \u03b2-galactosidase, which produce blue color in the presence of X-Gal] reporters to monitor the protein-protein interactions. Strength of the interaction between the bait and the prey proteins in Mav203 was evaluated by scoring the colony growth on increasing concentrations of 3-AT, as mentioned above.",

Note that in our laboratory, Y2H screening involving full length ORF2 did not identify any interaction partner, whereas 112-608aa of ORF2 could interact with a few host proteins (Subramani and Surjit, unpublished data). Therefore, in addition to the full length, 112-608aa of ORF2 was used in the current study. All constructs were transformed into Y2H gold along with an empty vector plasmid as negative control (BD) and expression of fusion proteins were confirmed by western blot of the whole cell extract of the transformed colonies using an antibody against the myc-tag, located between the GAL4 BD and our protein of interest. All the constructs produced expected size of the fusion protein (Fig. 1a). Similarly, the X-domain of HEV was cloned as a C-terminal fusion of the GAL4 activation domain (AD) into the yeast expression vector pGADT7 (named AD X) and its expression was confirmed by western blot of transformed Y2H gold whole cell extract using an antibody against the HA-tag, located between the GAL4 AD and the X-coding sequence (Fig. 1b).",

            "text": "AD X was transformed into Y2H gold along with the empty BD expression plasmid (pGBKT7) to monitor self-activation of the reporter genes. No background reporter activity was observed in the AD X+BD cotransformed colonies (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1), ruling out the possibility of self-activation by the X-domain. A previously reported interaction between the BD ORF3 and AD TSG10120 was used as a positive control for the assay. ORF3 and TSG 101 cotransformants could grow well on LTHA\u2212, LTH\u2212Ar+ and up to 20 mM 3-AT on LTH\u2212 plates, indicating that the assay was working as expected (Table 1). Representative images of the colonies obtained from various cotransformants have been shown to correlate with the empirical scoring (Supplementary Fig. S1). In quantitative liquid \u03b1-galactosidase assay too, ORF3-TSG 101 cotransformed samples displayed significant \u03b1-galactosidase activity, compared to the vector controls (Fig. 1c). Next, AD X was transformed in pair with different HEV proteins followed by replica plating of the transformants onto different selection media. AD X, BD ORF3 and AD X, BD Met (methyltransferase) cotransformants could grow on the LTH\u2212, LTHA\u2212, LTH\u2212Ar+ plates and produced blue colonies on the LT\u2212+X-\u03b1-gal plates, indicating that the X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase. Note that, neither ORF3 nor methyltransferase displayed self-activation, evident from the inability of AD+BD ORF3 and AD+BD Met cotransformants to activate any of the reporters (Table 1, Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S1). Comparison of growth of the cotransformants on increasing concentrations of 3-AT supplemented LTH\u2212 plates revealed that AD X+BD ORF3 could grow at 20 mM 3-AT (Table 1), whereas the AD X+BD Met could grow only up to 5 mM 3-AT (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Further, the AD X+BD Met cotransformants also displayed poor growth on LTHA\u2212, LTH\u2212Ar+ plates and less intense blue colonies on LT\u2212+X-\u03b1-gal plates (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting a weak interaction of the X-domain with the methyltransferase, compared to that of the ORF3. Similar results were obtained in the quantitative \u03b1-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1c). The AD X and BD helicase cotransformants could activate only the ADE2 and HIS3 reporters, evident from their ability to grow on the LTHA\u2212, LTH\u2212 and LTH\u2212+ 5 mM 3-AT plates. Neither did they grow on the LTH\u2212Ar+ plates nor displayed blue colonies on the LT\u2212+X-\u03b1-gal plates (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the \u03b1-galactosidase activity between the AD X+BD helicase and AD+BD helicase cotransformants (Fig. 1c). In our hands, DUF3729 itself activated all reporters, rendering it unsuitable for the Y2H analysis. No other viral protein interacted with the X-domain. Similar results were obtained when the bait and prey domains were swapped (data not shown). The same experiment was performed using the Mav203 yeast strain. In our laboratory conditions, both the URA3 and lacZ reporters of Mav203 displayed excessive background activity, ruling out their usefulness. Hence, cotransformants were grown on the LTH\u2212 medium containing increasing concentrations of 3-AT to evaluate the interaction between the X and other viral proteins. In agreement with the Y2H gold data, X-domain interacted strongly with ORF3 than methyltransferase in the Mav203 strain (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The X-domain and helicase cotransformants could grow up to 10 mM 3-AT on the LTH\u2212 plates, as the negative controls (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2).",

However, shorter fragments within the above region [56-96aa (D6 X) or 70-118aa (D7 X)] were unable to interact with the ORF3 protein (Fig. 3a). Secondary structure analysis of the X-domain from various HEV isolates using Mac Vector (Mac Vector Inc., North Carolina, USA) predicted the presence of two conserved \u03b2-sheet structures within the 47-118aa region, which were absent in the D6 X and D7 X mutants. Assuming that those structures were responsible for mediating the interaction between the X and ORF3, we planned to introduce point mutations at crucial amino acid positions within 47-118aa region to destroy the predicted \u03b2-sheets without deleting multiple amino acids at a stretch. Secondary structure analysis of the X-domain predicted that altering 66 and 67 isoleucines (I) to glutamic acid (E) II66,67EE lead to complete disappearance of the \u03b2 sheet from 58th-70thaa. Altering 93 arginine (R) to glutamic acid (E) R93E or 94 leucine (L) to arginine (R) L94R lead to partial destruction of the \u03b2-sheet present between 90th-111thaa, whereas altering 101 and 102 leucines (L) to glutamic acid (E) LL101,102EE lead to almost complete disappearance of the same \u03b2-sheet. Except for the 94th L, which was conserved in 60% sequences, all other altered amino acids (66th, 67th I; 93rd R and 101st, 102nd L) were fully conserved across all HEV isolates analyzed (Fig. 3c). Secondary structure analysis of a triple mutant (R93E, LL101,102EE) predicted complete loss of the 90th-111th \u03b2-sheet.",

A pull down assay was performed to evaluate whether the ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for binding to the X-domain. Approximately same molar equivalents (500 fmol) of the ORF3 and the methyltransferase proteins were allowed to bind with 500 fmol of the GST-X protein. Bound fractions were compared to that obtained by incubating 500 fmol ORF3 with GST-X or 500 fmol methyltransferase with GST-X. With reference to the input amount (50% loaded, Fig. 5f Lane 9, upper panel and Lane 10, middle panel), ~50% of methyltransferase and ~25% of ORF3 could be pulled down by the GST-X (Fig. 5f, Lane 2, upper panel and Lane 3, middle panel). Relative intensities of the bands have been quantified with reference to 100% of input protein and plotted in the accompanying graph (Fig. 5f, bottom panel). When all the three proteins were incubated together, ~5% of methyltransferase and ~10% of ORF3 could be detected in the bound fraction (Fig. 5f, Lane 4, upper and middle panel). Next, increasing quantities of either methyltransferase or ORF3 were used in the incubation mixture, keeping the quantity of ORF3 and GST-X or methyltransferase and GST-X constant. Increasing the methyltransferase amount by two and four fold molar excess increased its level in the bound fraction, simultaneously decreasing the level of ORF3 in the same fraction (Fig. 5f, Lanes 5 and 6, upper and middle panels). However, increasing the ORF3 quantity by two fold molar excess completely abolished the methyltransferase interaction (Fig. 5f, Lane 7), indicating that ORF3 possesses higher affinity for association with the X-domain compared to that of methyltransferase. These data also demonstrate that no cooperativity exists between the ORF3 and the methyltransferase for binding to the X-domain.",

The BD ORF3-Met and AD-X cotransformants revealed that ORF3 interacted with the X-domain in the presence of methionine (1mM methionine was supplemented in the medium to suppress MET25 promoter activity). Upon replica plating of the same colonies onto various selection media lacking methionine, growth was observed only on the LTM\u2212 plates (Table 2; see also Supplementary Fig. S3).

Three independent assays were conducted to validate the true interaction partners: (a) Y2H assay identified direct interaction partners of the X-domain in a heterologous and in vivo set-up. Use of two different yeast strains and domain swapping ruled out the possibility of experimental artifacts; (b) CoIP assays established that the interactions obtained in Y2H assay were strong enough to be reproduced in human hepatoma cells, in the presence of many other potential host interaction partners of the X, methyltransferase and the ORF3; (c) an in vitro pull down assay using partially purified recombinant proteins confirmed that the two interaction partners possess the required motif/signature sequence to associate with each other. Only those viral factors, which could interact with the X-domain in the above three assays were considered as true interaction partners. Therefore, according to our data, only viral methyltransferase and ORF3 happen to be the direct intra-viral interaction partners of the X-domain. Viral helicase activated only two of the four reporter genes in the Y2H gold based assay. Neither did it show positive interaction in the Mav203 based Y2H assay nor associated with the X-domain in the CoIP assay. Therefore, it is not a direct interaction partner of the X-domain. This finding is in contrast to a recent report published by Osterman and coworkers31, who reported helicase to associate with the X-domain. However, it is noteworthy that in both their assays, bait and prey were fusion proteins, (fused to BD and AD in Y2H assay and MBP and eGFPLuc in LuMPIS assay), which might have influenced their interaction properties. In our CoIP assay, X and helicase proteins contained only 8 extra amino acids (contain HA and Myc tags, respectively).

It is involved in 7-methylguanosine mRNA capping, like the HEV methyltransferase and is also conserved in a broad range of organisms39. C20orf133/MACROD2 is a macro domain containing protein.

Comparison with known protein binding motifs did not indicate any homology of the dileucine-containing region to known motifs. Thus, it is unlikely that the two leucine residues are essential amino acids of a linear motif. It could be possible that they maintain a favourable structure or permissive electrostatic environment for binding of the X-domain with the ORF3 or methyltransferase.

Nevertheless, genetic mutants identified in this study will be instrumental in investigating the functional significance of the interaction between X and methyltransferase or ORF3 during the life cycle of HEV. The II66,67EE and LL101,102EE mutations can be introduced in the HEV genome to investigate the functional significance of the interaction between the ORF3, methyltransferase and the X-domain. It is worth mentioning that the C-terminal region of the HEV macro domain is highly conserved: the 66, 67 isoleucine and the 101, 102 leucines are absolutely conserved across all genotypes and isolates of the HEV.

ORF3 is a viral late protein, synthesized from the subgenomic RNA, which is generated after replication of the genomic RNA1. ORF3 has been shown to be dispensable for viral replication but essential for release of the progeny virus from infected cells414243. On the other hand, methyltransferase, which is involved in capping of the viral genome, seems to be important during early stages of the viral life cycle. Assuming that the X-domain is involved in both replication and release of the progeny virus, it might be worth speculating that the X-domain associates with and modulates the activity of the viral methyltransferase during early stages of the infection. At a later stage, ORF3 sequesters away the X-domain from associating with the methyltransferase by virtue of its ability to associate with the X-domain with a higher affinity. This shifts the focus of the virus from replication to packaging and release of the progeny. Future studies are directed at exploring the validity of the above hypothesis and revealing the functional significance of the interaction between the viral macro domain, methyltransferase and ORF3 proteins.
