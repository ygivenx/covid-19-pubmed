Its high fatality rate and human-to-human spread renders the virus a potential bioterrorism weapon. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic regimens for the disease. A safe and efficient vaccine for EBOV is yet to be developed. EBOV is an enveloped single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Filoviridae[3]. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV is an important virulence factor and mediates cell receptor binding and virus\u2013cell membrane fusion [2,4-10]. GP protein also plays a central role in inducing protective neutralizing antibodies in the host [11,12]. Several recombinant GP-expressing viruses have been developed, including replication-defective adenovirus-5 (rAd5) [13,14], replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [15,16], Newcastle diseases virus (NDV)[17], rabies virus (RV) [18] and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPAIV) (Bukreyev et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of the genus Avulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. NDV strains are classified as nonvirulent (lentogenic), moderately virulent (mesogenic), or highly virulent (velogenic) in poultry [19]. NDV has two envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuramidinase (HN) and fusion protein (F). HN functions sialic acid receptor binding and F induces fusion during cell entry of NDV [20]. Viral virulence is mainly determined by the amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of theF precursor [20]. Lentogenic strains contain fewer basic amino acids at this site and can only be cleaved by trypsin-like extracellular proteases, which are largely confined to the respiratory tract, whereas highly virulent strains are cleaved by ubiquitous intracellular proteases, potentially resulting in systemic infections [21]. The attractions of NDV as a vaccine vector for emerging human infectious diseases include: preexisting immunity and maternal antibodies to mammalian paramyxoviruses do not interfere with the infection or replication of NDV because NDV is antigenically distinct from the mammalian paramyxoviruses [22,23]; lentogenic NDV usually shows limited replication in mammalian host cells because it requires a trypsin-like proteinase for the cleavage of the F glycoprotein [20,21,24,25]. Currently, lentogenic NDV strains, such as the LaSota strain, are used as live attenuated vaccines against NDV in poultry [26] and have been actively developed and evaluated as vaccine vectors for the control of human and animal infectious diseases, including influenza [27,28], severe acute respiratory syndrome [29], human parainfluenza [30], highly pathogenic H5N1 [13,31,32], human immunodeficiency virus [33,34], rabies [35], Nipah disease [36], and Rift Valley fever [37]. The safety and efficacy of NDV has been demonstrated in mice [32,36], dogs [35], pigs [36], cattle [38,39], sheep [37], African green and rhesus monkeys [17,30], and humans [40-43]. Recently, a study by DiNapoli et al. showed that a recombinant NDV expressing EBOV GP was immunogenic and caused no abnormalities or disease symptoms after its inoculation into rhesus monkeys [17]. Their study also showed that EBOV GP was incorporated into the recombinant NDV particles, which raised a serious question. Does EBOV GP function biologically normally in the virus particle during cell entry? If so, this entails biosafety concerns regarding the candidate vaccine vector.",

These prepared viruses were then used to infect BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02\u20130.05 with no exogenous trypsin in the medium. As expected, rLa-cell did not infect any cells (Figure 2, column 2), whereas rLa-egg and rLa-cell/TPCK infected individual cells but did not spread between the cells. However, rLa-EBOVGP-egg, rLa-EBOVGP-cell, and rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK showed similar infectivity and spreadability in the cells. At 120 h postinfection (PI), more than 90% of cells were infected by all the differently prepared rLa-EBOVGP viruses (Figure 2, columns 3 and 4).

This is the first step in infection and a prerequisite for viral replication [26]. EBOV has only one envelope glycoprotein, which functions in receptor binding and membrane fusion [4-8]. To understand the impact of EBOV GP on the infectivity of the NDV vector, the sensitivities of rLa and rLa-EBOVGP to NDV antiserum and EBOV GP antiserum were evaluated and compared (Figure 3). As expected, both rLa-egg and rLa-cell were resistant to mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum (diluted 1:10) but were completely neutralized by chicken anti-NDV antiserum (diluted 1:100). However, both anti-NDV antiserum (diluted 1:100) and anti-EBOV GP antiserum (diluted 1:10) only partially neutralized rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, and rLa-EBOVGP-egg (Figure 3, column 2). The anti-NDV antiserum and anti-EBOV GP antiserum reduced the infection with each rLa-EBOVGP virus by about 90% and 60%, respectively (Figure 3, column 3). When the anti-NDV antiserum (diluted 1:100) and anti-EBOV GP antiserum (diluted 1:10) were mixed, infection with rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-cell was completely blocked (Figure 3, column 4). The same dilution of SPF chicken0020serum, na\u00efve mouse serum, or a mixture of SPF chicken serum and na\u00efve mouse serum, used as the controls, showed no neutralization activity against any of the differently prepared rLa or rLa-EBOVGP viruses. These results suggest that the incorporation of EBOV GP into the recombinant viral particle made the NDV vector more resistant to anti-NDV antiserum and more sensitive to anti-EBOV antiserum.",

            "text": "NVD envelope glycoproteins HN and F usually bind to receptor and induce virus-cell membrane fusion at neutral pH. A previous study reported that NDV can also partially enter the host cells by caveolae-mediated endocytosis [45], whereas EBOV mainly enters cells via macropinocytosis [46-48] in a GP-dependent manner [46,49]. Because EBOV GP is incorporated into the vector NDV particles and independently mediates the cell entry of rLa-EBOVGP, it is necessary to determine whether the incorporation of the GP protein alters the endocytosis pattern of rLa-EBOVGP during infection. To address this question, we used two chemicals, IPA3 and methyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) to treat BHK-21 cells before their infection with the rLa or rLa-EBOV virus. IPA3 inhibits the activation of PAK1 kinase, which is required for macropinocytosis [50,51] and M\u03b2CD sequesters cholesterol from the cell membrane, thus inhibiting clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis [52,53]. As shown in Figure 4, the infection of IPA3-pretreated BHK-21 cells with rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-egg was greatly reduced, whereas IPA3 had no inhibitory effect on the infectivity of rLa-egg or rLa-cell/TPCK. Fewer than 10% of IPA3-pretreated cells were infected with rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-egg compared with the untreated cells. Infection by rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-egg was not inhibited in cells pretreated with M\u03b2CD, but their infection by rLa-cell/TPCK and rLa-egg was moderately reduced. Pretreatment with a combination of IPA3 and M\u03b2CD almost completely blocked the infection of cells by rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, and rLa-EBOVGP-egg, and also mildly inhibited the infection of cells by rLa-cell/TPCK and rLa-egg. To further testify the role of EBOV GP on the internalization of the recombinant virus, we use 800 mU/ml bacterial neuraminidase (NA, Sigma N2876) to treat cells with chemical inhibitors together with IPA3 or alone before infection. Our preliminary data showed use 800 mU/ml NA to treat cells could block over 90% of NDV infection, thus in this assay we used NA to exclude the influence of HN protein in the internalizaiton of rLa-EBOVGP-egg and rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK. Also shown in Figure 4 (right panel), NA treatment reduced over 90% of rLa-egg and rLa-cell/TPCK infection, while it had almost no reduction on the infection of rLa-EBOVGP-egg, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK and rLa-EBOVGP-cell. The NA + IPA3 treatment could block 90% of the recombinant viruses from infection, while NA + M\u03b2CD had no inhibition on these viruses. These results futher explicated the role of GP on the macropinocytotic internalization of the recombinant viruses. In conclusion, Our results indicate that recombinant rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as its major internalization pathway for cell entry, rather than the direct fusion at the cell plasma membrane at neutral pH like NDV.",

The V protein encoded by the NDV P gene functions as an interferon antagonist and is usually less efficient in mammalian cells [58-60]; NDV is usually a strong inducer of the interferon response in mammalian cells and is highly sensitive to the interferon induced in these cells [61,62]. The limited replication in mammalian cells of low-pathogenic NDV, like the LaSota strain, is also determined by its trypsin-dependent infectivity. The trypsin-independent infectivity acquired by rLa-EBOVGP means that this virus behaves like a velogenic NDV in mammalian host cells. Its restricted replication may have to depend on the only defense line in host, the native immunity.",

Our previous study showed that the G proteins of the rabies virus were incorporated on the surface of a recombinant NDV LaSota particle. An anti-rabies virus antiserum did not reduce the infectivity of the recombinant NDV [35]. The G proteins on the virion surface of the rabies virus did not mediate the infection of cells by the recombinant NDV particle [35]. The reasons for these phenomena are unclear. Another study showed that EBOV GP was incorporated into the viral particle of recombinant human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV3) and that the recombinant hPIV3 became more sensitive to neutralizing antibody directed against EBOV than to neutralizing antibody directed against hPIV3 [63]. Because the biological functions of the hPIV3 envelope glycoproteins could not be abolished, it was difficult to clarify whether EBOV GP on the virion surface functioned independently to mediate the infection of cells by the recombinant hPIV3 particle. In the present study, the recombinant NDV rLa-EBOVGP-cell was prepared in BHK-21 cells in the absence of trypsin, so the membrane fusion function of the F protein, essential for viral entry, was completely abolished. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the EBOV GP that was incorporated into the viral particle independently mediated the cell entry of the recombinant NDV.",

            "text": "As a prototype member of the paramyxoviruses, NDV usually enters host cells by direct fusion at the plasma membrane via a pH-independent mechanism [68-70]. However, NDV can also enter host cells by an endocytic pathway [45]. It had been shown that the cellular entry of EBOV involves a macropinocytosis-like mechanism and subsequent trafficking through early and late endosomes [46,47,71]. Recently, Niemann-Pick C1, a protein involved in the endocytic pathways, has been identified as an important host factor in the cell-entry process [72,73]. In this study, the neutralization assay showed that the mixture of anti-NDV antiserum and anti-EBOV GP antiserum completely blocked the infectivity of rLa-EBOVGP, whereas either anti-NDV antiserum or anti-EBOV GP antiserum only partially blocked the infectivity of this virus. Therefore, we infer that both the NDV envelope proteins F/HN and EBOV GP contribute to the cell entry of rLa-EBOVGP. It is surprising that the inhibition of macropinocytosis almost completely abolished the infectivity of rLa-EBOVGP, whereas it did not markedly reduce the infectivity of rLa. These results indicate that the direct fusion between rLa-EBOVGP and the plasma membrane facilitated by F/HN may not allow viral entry into the cell. EBOV GP plays a major role in the cell-entry process of rLa-EBOVGP, and may predominate over NDV F/HN in the cell-entry function of this recombinant virus. The exact mechanism underlying this predominance requires further investigation. The recombinant virus rLa-EBOVGP provides an interesting model with which to explore the functional interactions between native and foreign envelope glycoproteins in one viral particle.",

The amplified fragment was digested with PmeI and then inserted into the P\u2013M intergenic region at nucleotide position 3165 of the NDV genome, as described previously [32]. The resultant plasmid was used for recombinant NDV rescue, as described previously [32]. The expression of EBOV GP was confirmed with an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blotting. The resultant recombinant virus was designated \u201crLa-EBOVGP\u201d.",
