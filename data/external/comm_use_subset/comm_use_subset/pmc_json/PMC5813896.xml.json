Fast forward to 2015, and we find that the DALYs from diarrheal disease have dropped by 25.6% so that it now ranks 8th, while tuberculosis has dropped to 22nd, and measles and tetanus no longer rank in the top 30 leading causes of DALYs [4].

The GBD 2013 reports that the global prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis has increased 174% since 1990, with much of that increase attributed to a sharp uptick in the number of cases in the EMR [8, 9].

Compared to the years before the Syrian conflict, for instance, the numbers of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases are thought to have since increased 2\u20135-fold to over 100,000 cases in 2014 alone, due to the stoppage of vector control activities and the creation of new sand fly breeding sites amid the bombed-out rubble in cities such as Aleppo [13]. Subsequently, some indoor residual spraying has resumed so that the expected numbers of new cases may not be as high [13]. However, cutaneous leishmaniasis remains hyperendemic in Syria, and the reemergence of visceral leishmaniasis has now also been noted [13].",

There is an urgent need to better understand the drivers for dengue emergence and to determine the relative contributions of conflict, climate change, and human migrations and commerce [15]. There are also several other emerging NTDs of concern, including Rift Valley fever previously introduced into the Arabian Peninsula from Kenya, and several other viral hemorrhagic fevers (HFs), including Alkhurma HF and Crimean-Congo HF [16, 17].",

Today, the world\u2019s Islamic nations belonging to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) account for a high percentage of the global burden of NTDs [21]. Potentially one or more of these diseases could soon consume the EMR and possibly other parts of the Islamic world. We therefore need to identify mechanisms to isolate or control the NTDs now emerging from the conflict zones and promote better cooperation between the warring factions for this purpose. Ultimately, the Muslim world has been rendered highly vulnerable to NTDs, which will further destabilize OIC countries and promote poverty.",

In terms of nations adjacent to Middle East conflict zones, currently both Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, have substantial capacities for vaccine biotechnology. We need to do better tapping into those strengths. In my role during 2015 and 2016 as United States science envoy for the State Department and White House, I worked to expand collaborations between the US and Saudi Arabia, now leading to joint scientific activities in the area of vaccine development. But such initiatives in the area of vaccine diplomacy need to be expanded. Could US-Saudi vaccine diplomacy extend to other nations? It would be worthwhile to also explore the inclusion of other nations in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, particularly those that do not have historical connections to Saudi Arabia. In so doing, vaccine diplomacy could become a key 21st-century theme to address regional NTDs arising out of conflict and to promote international cooperation in the region and among the OIC nations.",
