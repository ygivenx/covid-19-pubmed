            "text": "Egg drop syndrome is a viral disease, caused by the egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV), officially called duck adenovirus 1 (DAdV-1), belonging to species Duck adenovirus A, genus Atadenovirus, family Adenoviridae. EDSV was first reported in 1976, it has also been known as adenovirus 127 and egg-drop-syndrome-76 (EDS-76) virus [1]. EDS is characterized by the production of soft-shelled, thin shelled, shell-less, and discolored eggs in otherwise healthy chickens [2]. The natural hosts of the EDSV are ducks and geese, however, the virus can also infect chickens, resulting in major economic losses on egg production [3, 4]. EDSV was involved in severe respiratory disease in 1-day-old goslings where the presence of EDSV DNA was found in different organs of the naturally and experimentally infected goslings [5]. Severe acute respiratory symptoms with coughing, dyspnea, and gasping were reported in 9-day-old Pekin ducklings in 2013 [6]. For diagnosis of EDSV, five serological methods have been used and tested [7]. In the recent years, several PCR studies have been published, for diagnosis of all avian adenoviruses that are of relevance for poultry production [8\u201310]. Molecular amplification methods were commonly used to diagnose EDSV infection [11].",

It was first developed by the Japanese researchers, the LAMP employs a DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA [12]. Later, LAMP was supplemented by using additional primers, termed loop primers which prime strand displacement DNA synthesis. Moreover, LAMP has some advantages in comparison with PCR methods, including improved sensitivity and specificity, as well as time efficiency [13]. Since LAMP was published, a range of LAMP methods have been developed. The RealAmp is one of them, which attempted to improve the method for diagnosis by using a simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection by fluorescence in one platform [14]. Currently, the LAMP assays are utilized to detect bacterial and viral pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Acinetobacter baumannii, avian influenza virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and hemorrhagic enteritis virus [15\u201319].",

The conventional PCR methods have been employed in previous studies to diagnose the EDSV infection as a specific and sensitive method as compared to the serological methods [23]. A quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) assay based on hexon gene for the rapid detection of EDSV has also been reported [24]. While in 2014 a novel q-PCR assay was used to detect EDSV DNA in samples of interest [25]. Currently, a 151 bp fragment of the EDSV strain 127 penton base gene amplified by PCR with 100% nucleotide identity and confirmed by q-PCR [26]. In the present study, the ESEQuant tube scanner was capable of detecting samples in real-time, and it could analyse melting curves using computer software [14].",

Therefore we designed the first EDSV detection by utilizing an assay based on the direct RealAmp. The results of this study clearly indicated the superiority of the RealAmp assay in the detection of EDSV compared to a conventional PCR assay. In order to facilitate improved virus detection, diluted samples of allantoic fluid, and cell culture supernatants were used in the direct RealAmp assay and the results have showed that our method was successfully identified the EDSV from both samples (Fig. 3a and b). The RealAmp cannot give a clear and rapid result, when the sample was highly concentrated (undiluted allantoic fluid sample); the problem lies in the quantity of primer to be much dispersed on different and many DNA pieces. So the self-limiting process could happen (Fig. 3a). In this study, RealAmp has amplified the EDSV fiber gene by using diluted recombinant plasmid DNA as low as 26 fg per microliter in 40 min, while the PCR was around 2.6 pg per microliter in 1 h and 30 min (Fig. 5a and 5c).",
