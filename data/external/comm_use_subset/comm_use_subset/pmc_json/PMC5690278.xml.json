This was due to international spread of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) particularly during the known low virus transmission season (January\u2013April/May) [7]. Then three months later in August 2014 hemorrhagic Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa was declared as a PHEIC due to potentiality of further international spread. Ebola was particularly serious in terms of rapid communicability and disastrous outcomes [8]. Furthermore EVD had showed devastating attacks to health care providers and emergency management teams [9]. Here in this debate we are discussing the overall concept of PHEIC and the overlapping of the two events in 2014. In addition we are discussing what PHEIC means to developing countries that affected by unrest and turmoil and taking Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan as examples.",

Both outbreaks are caused by viruses such as H1N1 which was previously declared as PHEIC in 2009 [10]. Both diseases have the ability for easy transmission, rapid propagation, and spread over wide geographical areas and crossing borders through different means [11]. The statistically estimated basic reproductive number (R0) of EVD is 2 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) While it is 6 For WPV-basic reproductive number is an epidemiological parameter that indicates the average secondary cases attributed to the index case of a communicable disease [12],[13]. Both diseases have no specific antiviral medications and treatment is totally depends on symptomatic relieve, basic life and rehabilitation support interventions [14]. Not like EVD, WPV has well known and highly effective vaccines that are being used for many decades and currently the global community is implementing the Endgame strategy for eradicating the disease [15]\u2013[17].",

These countries like other several developing countries have been subject to long standing civil wars and turmoil. Two of these countries are directly involved in the current declared PHEIC related to Polio in the epidemiological block that includes both Afghanistan and Pakistan with a common viral circulation pattern and exporting the virus to each other. While Sudan is an African country that been affected by major disease outbreaks during the recent years such as Rift Valley fever outbreak in 2007 and Yellow fever outbreak in 2012. Within these countries we notice that classical index areas for spreading these outbreaks are the most vulnerable and security compromised areas. In Afghanistan, the Southern region including Kandahar and Helmand is persistently being the reservoir for WPV. The same is true for the tribal areas in northern part of Pakistan that remain as major contributor in terms of Polio related outbreaks. In Sudan, the index cases of Rift Valley fever outbreak started in the previous conflict border between Sudan and the republic of South Sudan. In 2012, the yellow fever outbreak started and spread from security compromised areas in newly formed central Darfur state in the western part of the country.",

It revealed that countries have very low capacity to respond and control potential outbreak despite the fact that technical guidance have been provided to these countries. It is now clear more than any given time before that health systems should be adequately built in all such countries. National governments of these countries are required to prove the commitment to implementation of IHR (2005). Availing adequate or even the minimally required capacities to cope with any PHEIC in a country is the major determinant of the final outcome. This also could be concluded from the recent experience of response to current PHEIC. Despite the huge efforts that paid by international community represented by the United Nation Mission for Ebola Emergency Response [16],[21] and partners, the overall outcome and timeliness of emergency control was not satisfying. Several observers criticized the way of operation, technical response and leadership at the field level [8]. In the same regards repeated extensions of targeted deadline for achieving global Polio eradication is another critique point against the seriousness and effectiveness of international /global initiatives to control PHEICs [22],[23].",
