All swabs that tested positive by upE rtRTPCR had CT values \u226538 indicating low virus load and were confirmed by at least one additional RT-PCR assay targeting the ORF1a, N or S genes (Table 2). Four of these upE rtRT-PCR positive samples were ORF1a rtRTPCR positive while the others were confirmed by N or S (RBD) gene RT-PCR assays. Five samples were also confirmed by sequencing the RBD region of the spike gene. The host species of each MERS-CoV positive sample were confirmed by DNA barcoding to exclude possibility of mix up of camel swabs with those of other domestic livestock. Those RT-PCR positive animals were MERS-CoV seronegative. None of the swabs collected from sheep or goats in Tunisia was rtRT-PCR positive.\n\n",

We have previously reported a seropositive sheep raised in contact with camels in Egypt [11]. However, surveillance in mammals in an area where MERS-CoV infected camels in Jordan yielded negative results [7]. MERS-CoV infection was not detected in equids from the United Arab Emirates where camel and human infection were previously reported [9]. Although a study of horses in Saudi Arabia found no convincing evidence of MERS-CoV infection in these horses, one of 243 equine sera had a PRNT90 titre of 1:40 [8].",

Evidence of PRNT90 antibody was also found in 2 of 114 sheep sera collected from Tunisia and 1 of 112 goats in Egypt. Since not all VMN-positive sera from Egypt had sufficient serum to be tested in the confirmatory PRNT90 assay, we may have under-estimated the true sero-prevalence in livestock sampled in Egypt. The serological testing for MERS-CoV was carried out using a virus isolated in Egypt (camel/Egypt/163/14) (for the MN test) and prototype strain EMC (for the PRNT test). We have previously shown that MERS-CoV from East, West, and North Africa are antigenically indistinguishable from those in the Arabian Peninsula and prototype strain EMC [12].",

Our data suggest that cross-reactive BCoV antibody does not explain the observed antibody titres to MERS-CoV. The possibility of a hitherto undiscovered coronavirus cross-reacting with MERS-CoV cannot however be excluded.

These animals were sero-negative, as expected, as serological responses only appear 2\u20133 weeks after infection by which time virus RNA will usually be undetectable. The rtRT-PCR positive animals were asymptomatic as is the case for camels infected with MERS-CoV. The identity of the host species of the swabs positive for virus RNA was additionally confirmed by DNA barcoding in order to assure that no mix up with camel swabs had occurred during sampling or sample handling. Finding MERS-CoV RNA in upper respiratory tract swabs may simply represent exposure and environmental contamination from infected camels or environments contaminated with camel excretions rather than convincing evidence of active infection. In contrast, evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody implies evidence of active infection by MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. Attempts to culture the viruses detected in the study or to obtain full-genome sequences were not successful hence limiting our ability to further verify the findings of this study. It is important to note that this evidence comes from countries where human infection with MERS-CoV was never reported locally and that evidence of MERS-CoV infection in non-camelid mammals was never reported in countries where human infections are common.",

This may be due to the absence of the A431T mutation in the virus used in those studies.

Our findings highlight the need for further field studies of domestic livestock, especially those that are in close contact with dromedary camels and also the need for experimental studies infecting livestock such as sheep using MERS-CoV isolates from Africa. Our findings may raise the need to segregate other livestock from dromedary camels in farms and live animal markets.",
