            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) cause significant hospitalization among children under 5 years old [1,2]. Although these infections are usually relatively mild, some children develop respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation and admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aetiology of (severe) LRTI is often difficult to establish. However, the majority of LRTIs in this young age group is believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. For the detection of respiratory viruses two conventional methods are commonly used: viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays. In addition, a third method based on molecular techniques has now become available, namely (real-time) PCR. Specifically, the real-time PCR format provides rapid results, within a clinically relevant period of time. It allows quantitative virus detection, and no post-PCR processing needs to be performed. Moreover, compared with standard format PCR, the risk for contamination is strongly reduced with real-time PCR, rendering false-positive results with real-time PCR highly unlikely [3].",

            "text": "Currently, there are no guidelines regarding which viral tests are appropriate for young children with LRTI in the PICU [4]. Conventional detection methods have several disadvantages compared with (real-time) PCR. Viral culture has been considered the gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses, but its limitation is that it can only detect a small number. Furthermore, the yield of viral culture depends on the quality of sampling, the correct transport and storage of samples, and the type of cells used. In addition, the technique has a turnaround time of several days to weeks, and is therefore unable to guide initial patient management. The results of DIF assays are available more rapidly, and this has been shown to improve patient outcome with less antibiotic use and shorter hospital stay [5-7]. Unfortunately, the DIF assay is less sensitive than culture for the detection of certain pathogens.",

Additional advantages of PCR include its ability to identify multiple viruses simultaneously, and to detect viral and atypical pathogens that cannot be cultured or for which no DIF is commercially available (for example, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Rapid and sensitive testing for a broad range of respiratory viruses is vital in the PICU, and it can improve our understanding of severe viral respiratory infections. Furthermore, it can be used to guide cohorting strategies that may protect other critically ill children and to guide initial therapy. Finally, evaluation of viral tests may be of future importance, when antiviral therapy becomes more widely available.",

When conducting a Medline search (1966 to September 2005) with the search terms LRTI, PCR, and RSV or respiratory viruses, we identified 11 hospital-based paediatric studies that compared PCR with conventional techniques for more than two respiratory viruses [8-11,16-22]. PCR was found to have excellent sensitivity in all studies, if conventional methods were considered the reference standard (0.91\u20131.00). In summary, these studies showed that PCR increased the diagnostic yield by by up to 25% as compared with conventional techniques. However, most studies selected patients on the basis of respiratory test results, rather than selecting patients by admission diagnosis. Exceptions include the studies conducted by Weinberg and coworkers [22] and Jennings and colleagues [9]. Weinberg and coworkers [22] tested samples from 668 hospitalized children and selected patients on admission diagnoses by the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. PCR assays were used to test for RSV, influenzaviruses and PIV 1\u20133. With viral culture 89 (13%) specimens were positive, as compared with 185 (28%) positive specimens with PCR. Jennings and colleagues [9] enrolled 75 hospitalized children using a case definition of acute respiratory infection, and performed viral diagnostics for a broad range of viruses. PCR identified 39 additional viruses, adding up to a total of 87 viruses found in 65 (87%) children [9].",
