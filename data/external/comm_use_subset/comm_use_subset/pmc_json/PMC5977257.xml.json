            "text": "Viruses and their hosts undergo coevolution and adaptation over long time scales and most viruses have a defined range of hosts. For example, most retroviruses have strict host tropism and can rarely jump from one species to another. However, the influenza A virus (FLUAV) of the Orthomyxoviridae can infect different hosts and the virus can transmit between species [1,2]. To successfully replicate in host cells, viruses need to counteract various host restriction factors at different replication steps. It is evident from several reports that host restriction factors, such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3 proteins (APOBEC3) [3,4,5], tripartite motif protein 5a (TRIM5a) [6], SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) [7,8], and tetherin [9] play important roles in blocking interspecies transmission of retroviruses. As with several other restriction factors, like interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), tetherin has been shown to have broad antiviral activity against different enveloped viruses from various virus families including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Ebola virus and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) [10,11,12].

Tetherin mainly blocks enveloped viruses through a shared mechanism tethering them to the cell membrane [16], while different viruses take different measures to antagonize its restriction [17]. Human tetherin (huTHN) was first reported as being able to inhibit egress of HIV-1 viral particles deficient in the viral membrane protein Vpu [9]. Vpu can downregulate huTHN from the cell surface by targeting it for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation [18,19]. Other enveloped viruses including HHV8, Ebola virus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) are also found to be restricted by tetherin and these viruses in different hosts have different counteraction mechanisms. For instance, SIV uses its nef to counteract simian tetherin, while EIAV env plays this role in overcoming equine tetherin (eqTHN) [20,21,22]. ",

            "text": "Interspecies transmission of animal FLUAV to humans may have the potential to cause pandemics and can result in severe disease and huge economic loss, such as the pandemics that occurred in 1918 and 2009. FLUAV is an enveloped virus with a segmented negative strand RNA genome. Two viral proteins play a significant role in interspecies transmission of FLUAV:HA, which is responsible for recognizing and binding with the sialic acid (SA) receptor on the surface of host cells; and NA, which helps the release of virions [2,23]. Mutations in HA can alter its preference from the \u03b12,3 to the \u03b12,6 SA receptor in order to adapt to humans [24]. Furthermore, compensatory mutations in NA may also be selected in order to achieve an optimal balance for effective viral transmission [25]. The role of tetherin in the inhibition of FLUAV budding has been investigated and some studies show that tetherin has no function in this area [26,27]. While in a recent study it was confirmed that the sensitivity of FLUAV to huTHN is strain specific, HA and NA are known to confer tetherin resistance to certain pandemic viruses [28]. To date, there are no studies on the activity of tetherins from different species that block FLUAV. Tetherin has been shown in many cases to have species-specific antiviral activity, especially in the restriction of retroviruses. An example is huTHN, which has broad anti-retrovirus activity, but can only be neutralized by HIV-1 Vpu protein [9,18,19]. Similarly, the anti-retrovirus activity of eqTHNs can only be counteracted by EIAV envelope protein but not other viruses [20]. It is interesting that for FLUAV, the activity of huTHN is limited to certain isolates from humans, but not isolates from other animals. It would be of great value to know, on one hand, whether tetherin from other animals (such as eqTHN) has anti-FLUAV activity and whether it is species specific; and on the other hand, by which mechanism FLUAV is able to counteract the anti-retroviral activity of tetherin.",

This sequence was then fused with the eqTHN fragment. To obtain the pLPCX_eqTHN_del_GPI and pLPCX_huTHN_del_14 plasmids, eqTHN_del_GPI and huTHN_del_14 sequences were amplified using pLPCX_eqTHN and pLPCX_huTHN as the templates, respectively, and were fused with the pLPCX-HA vector. The 8 plasmids for rescuing the virus A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) were kindly provided by Dr. Hualan Chen, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The 8 plasmids for rescuing the virus A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 (H3N8) were constructed in-house and stored at the laboratory. The plasmids HA_I49L, HA_A13T, NA_I32T and NA_M80V, for generating mutant viruses, were produced by PCR using mutation primers. All primer sequences are available upon request.

HuTHN, however, could not inhibit the production of SC09 (Figure 1D). The expression levels of endocellular NP in these three cell lines were almost the same (Figure 1E) and tetherin also expressed well (Figure 1F), which meant that neither eqTHN nor huTHN affected the production of viral protein and tetherin functioned by restricting the release of FLUAV. To extend these observations, in a further experiment, the virus A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 (H3N8) (abbreviated XJ07) was introduced to the same three cell lines at an MOI of 0.2. Quantification of the number of XJ07 viruses released into the supernatant showed no differences between huTHN-expressing and control cell lines. A roughly 3-fold reduction of XJ07 release that did not affect the expression of viral NP or cellular tetherins was observed in eqTHN-expressing MDCK cell lines compared with the control, which was statistically significant when assessed using an ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc test. Quantification of the number of XJ07 viruses released into the supernatant showed no differences between huTHN-expressing and control cell lines (Figure 1G\u2013I). Because of the importance of polymerase activity on FLUAV replication, we performed a polymerase assay to test whether tetherin could affect polymerase activity and caused the observed differences in restriction activity in eqTHN and huTHN towards both SC09 and XJ07. The expression of eqTHN or huTHN by transient transfection with increasing dose in HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous tetherin, had no impact on SC09 and XJ07 polymerase activity [31].

In both species, three cysteine residues, which are important for dimer formation, and two asparagine residues, which can be glycosylated in the extracellular domain [16,32], were conserved. It was obvious that eqTHN had a shorter cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain than huTHN, which has also been reported in feline tetherin [33]. A previous study demonstrated that the shorter cytoplasmic tail domain in eqTHN affected neither its localization nor the lentivirus tethering function [20]. However, the fact that tetherin is localized to lipid raft domains used for budding by FLUAV suggested to us that the shorter cytoplasmic tail domain of eqTHN might affect its antiviral function. ",

These two mutant proteins were also expressed as the wild types (Figure 2B,D). SC09 was then used to infect the control and the cells expressing tetherin and its mutants at MOIs of 0.01 or 0.1, respectively. We found that the release of SC09 was markedly inhibited by eqTHN at both MOIs, while hu_eqTHN had only very limited ability to block SC09 egress (Figure 2C). As with huTHN, huTHN_del_14 was unable to inhibit the budding of SC09 (Figure 2D).

We examined whether the GPI domain functioned in the inhibition of wild-type SC09 release, by generating eqTHN GPI-deleted MDCK cell lines (eqTHN_del_GPI). The expression levels of eqTHN_del_GPI were higher than those of eqTHN (Figure 3A), although quantification of the number of SC09 viruses released into the supernatants showed no significant differences between the eqTHN_del_GPI-expressing and the control cells (Figure 3B). This clearly suggested that GPI was required for eqTHN activity, and, furthermore, that the function of GPI was most likely to be due to its tethering potential rather than its localization, as the eqTHN_del_GPI could be expressed on the cell surface at a higher level, shown by subcellular distribution using fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results further confirmed that eqTHN could inhibit the release of FLUAV from MDCK cells, and that the GPI anchor was required for the tethering of nascent virus particles onto the cell surface.",

In our experiments, huTHN was unable to block the release of SC09r\u00d7HBG HA/NA at an MOI of 0.1 at any of the time points assessed (Figure 4A). By contrast, eqTHN fully lost the ability to inhibit the egress of SC09r\u00d7HBG HA/NA, with an equal amount of virus being observed in eqTHN-expressing and the control cells (Figure 4B). The results showed HA and NA of both SC09 and HBG were able to counteract huTHN, but only HA and NA of HBG were able to antagonize eqTHN.

There were no differences in localization between them (Figure 4C). EqTHN and huTHN still localized on the surface of cells with either SC09 or SC09r\u00d7HBG HA/NA infection or without infection, which indicated that HA and NA did not interfere with their localization. However, the expression levels of eqTHN and huTHN seemed to increase after infection which could be explained by rising interferon (IFN) levels after viral infection in order to achieve the antiviral goal of the host, and eqTHN increased most with SC09 infection. We therefore speculated that the strong restriction activity of eqTHN against SC09 might be due to the fact that HA and NA of SC09 could not degrade eqTHN while SC09r\u00d7HBG HA/NA could. ",

An alignment of amino acid sequences of HA and NA in SC09 with those of HBG revealed differences at only 2 positions in each protein, namely positions 13 and 49 of HA, and positions 32 and 80 of NA (Figure 5A), indicating that these sites were likely to contribute to the eqTHN resistance phenotype. Since the relationship between the protein structure and changes in protein interactions could allow viruses to replicate effectively in the host, we speculated that these sites might affect the structures of HA and NA. To verify this, we predicted the structures of HA and NA of both virus strains using the online service Phyre2 (Figure 5B,C). The differences in N-terminal direction, and the number of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets in the stalk-like HA2 domain could be seen between SC09 and HBG (Figure 5D). HA2 is known to first anchor HA to the viral membrane and then to facilitate membrane fusion of the virus with the endosomal bilayer, both of which are important for viral replication in host cells [35]. Modification of HA2 might alter its interaction with eqTHN and thus keep or even enhance its role in viral replication and release. As the structure of the N-terminal of NA has not been resolved to date, we were unable to determine whether there was a structural change in NA.",

The release of SC09HA A13T and SC09HA I49L was markedly inhibited compared with that of SC09rHBG HA, showing that viruses with a single point mutation in HA almost completely lost the ability to overcome eqTHN restriction (Figure 5F), while mutants with a single point mutation in NA could still greatly enhance release of SC09 from eqTHN-expressing cells (Figure 5G). Because the release of SC09NA I32T or SC09NA M80V only displayed 1.5\u20133 fold reduction (p < 0.01), compared with an around 20-fold decrease (p < 0.001) of SC09, SC09HA A13T or SC09HA I49L in eqTHN-expressing cells in comparison with the control cells.

There is strong evidence that huTHN is able to inhibit the release of FLUAV VLPs [26,34,43].

To date, the only tetherin that has been investigated with respect to human FLUAV strains has been huTHN. Here, we demonstrate that eqTHN can inhibit release of SC09 while huTHN has no effect on it, showing that there is an interspecies restriction between FLUAV and its hosts imposed by tetherin. The fact that the human FLUAV HBG can not be inhibited by eqTHN and that the equine FLUAV XJ07 is not sensitive to huTHN indicates the complex coevolution between FLUAV and tetherins.",

Furthermore, the techniques, including plaque formation assay and FFU assay to detect whether virus titers are similar in control and tetherin-expressing cells, can potentially cover up small differences after viral reinfection and replication in MDCK cells and cost more time [28,34].

We sampled at different time points (from 24 h to 60 h post-infection) to display the growth kinetics of the viruses in tetherin-expressing MDCK cells. The results from AC-ELISA are consistent with those of the FFU assay, suggesting that the ELISA can be used as an indirect measure of viral titers. Since the tetherin functions at the viral budding stage by tethering the virions onto the cell membrane, we would normally only be able to observe the effect from 24 h to 60 h post-infection. And with increasing viral production latterly, the tetherin was saturated and the difference of viral productions between wild-type and tetherin positive cells dwindled (Figure 1B,C).",

To overcome the species barrier, the virus requires several adaptations to the new host [46,47]. Theoretically, adaptive mechanisms can be divided into two categories. The first category comprises adaptations to the host, including changes in the viral HA, NA and polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) during the adaptation of avian FLUAV to humans [48,49]. The second comprises adaptations to antagonize host restriction factors that inhibit viral replication. Our results suggest that eqTHN has a strong inhibitory activity towards both human FLUAV SC09 and equine FLUAV XJ07, while huTHN can not affect either of them. This supports a previous study showing that human, avian, swine, and equine FLUAV strains are broadly insensitive to huTHN [27]. It may be that a human can be infected by a wide range of FLUAV, whereas limited strains are able to spread between horses and the H3N8 subtype viruses are the only viruses currently circulating in horses [50].",

Unfortunately, there is little information about adaptive mutations that overcome such host restriction factors and facilitate interspecies transmission of FLUAV. It is extremely difficult to find key sites of antagonism against tetherin in HA and NA, due to their high mutation rates. In the present study, we find that 13T and 49L in HA, and 32T and 80V in NA play an important role in overcoming the inhibition of eqTHN in an SC09 context. These four amino acids exist naturally in the human H1N1 strain of swine origin, HBG. This strain was isolated from a patient in Hamburg during the 2009 pandemic and then was adapted to the mouse in the lab by serial passages [51]. Adaptive mutations in the nucleoprotein of HBG to avoid restriction by human myxovirus resistance proteins \u2160 (Mx1 or MxA) have been identified [52]. Different amino acid positions are identified in A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 and HBG NP, demonstrating the strong positive selection pressure exerted on the viruses by human MxA. The emergence of 13T and 49L in HA and 32T and 80V in NA to counteract eqTHN in our study may have also resulted from selective pressure. Of note was that HBG was only found to spread between humans. The resistance to eqTHN might be linked to a complex evolutionary history between FLUAV and its hosts, which was consistent with the ability of Ebola virus glycoprotein to counteract human, primate, and murine tetherins [53].

            "text": "Many studies have shown that the unusual molecular topology of tetherin is important for its tethering function [10,54]. Our study shows that eqTHN both carries a shorter N-terminal region and displays strong inhibition on FLUAV release. The shorter cytoplasmic domain of eqTHN compared with huTHN leads to the loss of a dual-tyrosine motif (Y6\u2013Y8). This region has been found to be key for the internalization of tetherin from lipid rafts on the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [55,56]. Moreover, it has also been shown to be required for the introduction of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in HEK293T cells, while it is dispensable for its antiviral activity [57]. However, MDCK cells are extremely insensitive to transfection reagents and it is thus difficult to transfect them. We were unable to perform this experiment to confirm whether eqTHN better activates NF-\u039aB signaling pathways in MDCK cells, leading to greater antiviral activity. Murine tetherin also has a short N-terminal region, in which the first ATG is mutated, causing a higher level of expression and thus more potent inhibition of viral release [58]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a shorter form of ovine tetherin possesses stronger antiviral activity than does the longer form [59]. A crystal structure of the protein complex including the viral membrane protein Vpu in HIV-1, the huTHN cytoplasmic domain and the core of clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1) lays the foundation for our understanding of how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways so that they mistraffick tetherin and cause its degradation [60], thus promoting release of the virus. However, it is unclear how a shorter N-terminal region on tetherin affects the antiviral activity and this mechanism of action needs to be further explored.",
