            "text": "Viral infections are initiated by binding of a virus particle to specific receptors at the surface of host cells (1). Monosaccharide sialic acids (SAs), a large family of neuraminic acid derivatives, decorate all eukaryotic cell surfaces, usually at the termini of glycans attached as glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, and the proteoglycan keratin sulfate (2). Since SA on the cell surface is readily accessible, SA itself often serves as a receptor for a significant number of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Representatives from at least nine different virus families use SA as receptors: Picornaviridae (3), Caliciviridae (4), Orthomyxoviridae (5), Paramyxoviridae (6), Coronaviridae (7), Reoviridae (8), Parvoviridae (9), Polyomaviridae (10), and Adenoviridae (11). Most SAs as virus receptors are terminal SAs attached to the underlying sugar chain by an \u03b12,3 linkage or an \u03b12,6 linkage. This may contribute to virus tissue tropism, pathogenesis, and host specificity (1, 12).",

Simian, avian, and porcine picornaviruses have been recently assigned as members of a new picornavirus genus, Sapelovirus (14, 15).",

            "text": "PSV infections in the field and experimental infections in orally inoculated pigs may cause either asymptomatic or symptomatic infections. In the latter case, infection is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders, including diarrhea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders (16\u201318). Pigs are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to PSV, although pregnant guinea pigs experimentally infected with PSV developed placental lesions (17, 19). Transmission of PSV is primarily through the fecal-oral route (17), but aerosol infection may lead to lung infection (20). PSVs are readily cultivated in cell cultures of porcine origin, including primary or secondary pig kidney cell cultures and the IB-RS-2 pig kidney cell line (21). Among cell lines from other species, PSVs can replicate in a baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cell line but not in human cervical cancer (HeLa) or African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines (21). PSVs has been isolated from the feces of healthy or diarrheic pigs, from the central nervous system of pigs with polioencephalomyelitis, from the pig lung tissues with pneumonia, or from the tissues of stillborn, aborted, or mummified fetuses (16, 17). PSVs induce unique type II cytopathic effects (CPE) characterized by pyknotic nuclei and highly granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm with uneven protrusions in coverslip cultures stained with hematoxylin and eosin (22).",

Pretreatment of LLC-PK cells with various concentrations of NaIO4 markedly reduced the binding of AF-594-labeled PSV strain KS05151 (here referred to simply as PSV) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of NaIO4 treatment, we used FCV and EV70, both of which could utilize terminal SA as a receptor (3, 25). As a negative control, we used CVB3, which uses decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a receptor (33). As expected, pretreatment of cells with NaIO4 reduced the binding of carbohydrate-dependent FCV and EV70 in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on binding of DAF-dependent CVB3 (data not shown). To more accurately quantify the effect of NaIO4 treatment, radioisotope-labeled virus was incubated with cells after pretreatment with NaIO4, and virus binding was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Treatment of cells with 1 mM NaIO4 reduced the PSV binding to 54% of the levels of mock-treated cells, whereas 5 mM NaIO4 reduced its binding to 36% (Fig. 1B). As expected, NaIO4 treatment also resulted in a reduction in FCV and EV70 binding, but no effect on CVB3 binding was observed (Fig. 1B). PSV infection was also reduced to 16% or 2% of the levels of cells pretreated with only 1 mM or 5 mM NaIO4, respectively (Fig. 1C and D). A similar reduction in infection was observed in NaIO4-treated cells infected with known carbohydrate-binding viruses FCV and EV70, although no effect was seen in DAF-binding CVB3 (Fig. 1D). These data indicated that carbohydrate moieties were required for the binding and infection of PSV.",

FCV F9 and porcine sapovirus (PSaV) Cowden strains are known to recognize terminal SA as a receptor (4, 25). Among various SAs, however, binding of these viruses is blocked by monosaccharide NANA but not by monosaccharide Gal or oligosaccharide 6\u2032-SL (4, 25). To examine whether each SA could act as a receptor for PSV, various concentrations (20 to 80 mM) of monosaccharide (Gal and NANA) and oligosaccharide (6\u2032-SL) were incubated with AF-594-labeled or radiolabeled PSV or control viruses to analyze their impact on virus binding and infection. PSV binding was reduced by NANA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and B). As expected, the binding of SA-dependent FCV and EV70 was significantly blocked by NANA, whereas the binding of DAF receptor-dependent CVB3 was unaffected (Fig. 3B). Soluble NANA also significantly decreased the infection of PSV, FCV, and EV70 but not CVB3 (Fig. 3C and D). In contrast, preincubation with 6\u2032-SL or Gal had no inhibitory effect on the binding and infection of PSV, FCV, EV70, or CVB3, regardless of the concentration used (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrated that PSV, like FCV and EV70, could recognize SAs as receptors.",

Of these gangliosides, GM1, GD1a, and GT1b possess one terminal \u03b12,3-linked SA and the other gangliosides have no terminal \u03b12,3-linked SA, with or without internal \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,8-linked SA (36). LSTc contains one terminal \u03b12,6-linked SA. Reconstitution of gangliosides in cells following the PMDP treatment revealed that the PSV binding to and infection of LLC-PK cells could be restored only by GD1a (Fig. 7) and not the others (data not shown). PDMP treatment reduced the binding and infection of PSV to 24% and 1% of the levels observed in mock-treated cells (Fig. 7B and D). The decrease of binding and infection was rescued by the addition of GD1a (Fig. 7) but not by other gangliosides (data not shown). Binding and infection of the control RV strain Wa, which uses GM1a as a receptor (36), were also restored by the addition of GM1a (Fig. 7B and D) but not by other gangliosides (data not shown). These data suggest that PSV binds to both the terminal and internal \u03b12,3-linked SA moieties on GD1a and that the \u03b12,8-linked SA moiety on TG1b could interfere with binding of PSV.",

Among viruses within the family Picornaviridae, a number are known to use carbohydrates for attachment and entry. For example, EV70 (3), equine rhinitis A virus (37), and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (38) use \u03b12,3-linked SAs. However, encephalomyocarditis virus, a member within the genus Cardiovirus, recognizes \u03b12,6-linked SAs (39). Aside from carbohydrates, proteins have also been identified as coreceptors. EV71 can utilize both \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SAs in addition to several protein receptors (40). Some echoviruses can use CD55 and heparan sulfate (41). Here, we show that PSV utilizes \u03b12,3-linked SA on carbohydrates as a receptor. Preincubation of monosaccharide but not oligosaccharides significantly reduced binding and infection of not only SA-dependent control viruses (FCV and EV70) but also PSV in cultured cells (3, 25). Moreover, blocking \u03b12,3 linkage by SS and MAL but not \u03b12,6 linkage by SNL prevented binding and infection of PSV and control \u03b12,3 linkag-dependent EV70 (3). Our observation that \u03b12,3-linked SA functioned in PSV attachment to host cells further confirmed the important role of carbohydrates in the attachment of picornaviruses to target cells.",

We show that depletion of gangliosides from cell lipid membrane inhibited binding and infection of PSV, further suggesting the nature of PSV receptor as a form of glycolipid. To confirm which glycolipid is specifically recognized by PSV, cell surface glycolipids were depleted and specific gangliosides were reconstituted on the cell membrane. Reconstituting cell membranes with GD1a after depletion of cell surface gangliosides restored the binding and infection of PSV. However, other gangliosides had no influence on PSV binding and infection. Taken all together, our data show that PSV recognizes \u03b12,3-linked terminal SA on glycolipid GD1a as a receptor for binding and infection. In addition, our observation that chymotrypsin or trypsin treatment of cells had no effect on virus infection suggests that cell surface-associated proteins do not play accessory roles in PSV infection.",
