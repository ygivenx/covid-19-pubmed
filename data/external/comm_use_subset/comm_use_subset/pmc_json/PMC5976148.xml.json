The Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis [9] is endemic to this island, with a unique breeding population comprising less than 200 individuals [10]. Three other seabird species listed as Endangered, also breed on Amsterdam Island: Indian yellow-nosed albatross Thalassarche carteri [11], sooty albatross Phoebetria fusca [12] and northern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes moseleyi [13]. Notably, numbers of Indian yellow-nosed albatross breeding on Amsterdam Is. account for about 70% of the total for this species (Weimerskirch et al. in revision), further supporting the worldwide significance of this island for the conservation of threatened wildlife.",

This population decrease was first attributed to adult mortality in long-line fisheries, but further investigations suggested that a disease could also cause this population change [15,16]. Long-term monitoring of this population\u2019s demographic parameters showed that lowered adult survival and very low breeding success have both contributed to the population decline until the mid-1990s, but that the subsequent decline was primarily caused by a low fledging success [15]. During the 1996 breeding season, the survey of 100 yellow-nosed albatross nests revealed that 31 chicks died within a few minutes of convulsions, while being apparently healthy and well-fed a few weeks after hatching [16]. Laboratory analyses performed on 21 carcasses showed that 90% of them were infected by the bacteria Pasteurella multocida and 10% by the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [16]. Pasteurella multocida, and to a lesser extend E. rhusiopathiae, were thus suspected to induce, every year since the 1980s, extensive chick mortality in yellow-nosed albatrosses on Amsterdam Island, resulting in a low breeding success and decreasing population.",

This framework first requires to delineate the disease impact and extent on host populations, and to characterize the infectious agent(s) responsible for morbidity and mortality [21]. On Amsterdam Island, despite the critical situation of seabirds, no demographic trend has ever been published for the sooty albatross and the northern rockhopper penguin. As for yellow-nosed and Amsterdam albatrosses, the most recent demographic studies were published in 2009 and 2010, respectively [13,15]. Moreover, the potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known (occurrence frequency, characteristics) in the yellow-nosed albatross population [16] and have not been examined in others. In this context, this study aims to (i) analyze recent population trends of endangered seabird species on Amsterdam Island, (ii) test for the presence of P. multocida and/or E. rhusiopathiae in live birds among these populations, as well as (iii) search for other infectious agents in these samples, and (iv) characterize the causative agent(s) of epizooties from dead birds, through strain isolation and genotyping.",

The island is a volcanic dome rising to 881 m and surrounded by steep cliffs, mostly 20\u201380 m high but up to >700 m in the south-west (Entrecasteaux cliffs). At its center lies the Plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res, 550\u2013720 m above sea level. The only landing place ashore is in the north, where a permanent scientific station was built in 1949 hosting 20\u201330 people and catering tourists 2\u20133 times per year (30\u201340 people). Five large (over 1,000 g) seabird species breed annually or biennially on Amsterdam Island (see below). Several other seabird species including Antarctic terns Sterna vittata, great-winged Pterodroma macroptera and grey Procellaria cinerea petrels presumably also breed on Amsterdam Island, but in poorly known numbers and locations [22]. After the eradication of feral cattle in 2011, three introduced mammal species remain on the island, namely feral cats Felis catus, brown rats Rattus norvegicus and house mice Mus musculus.",

However, the very small population (40\u201350 pairs) of the biennially breeding Amsterdam albatross is found on the Plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res. Standardized counts of breeding pairs and fledged chicks have been conducted on study colonies to track changes in breeding population size and breeding success for these four species. Monitoring of breeding pairs started in 1981 for Amsterdam and yellow-nosed albatrosses (see [13,15] for further details), in 1996 for sooty albatrosses and in 1994 for rockhopper penguins (see [23,24]). Breeding success monitoring also started in 1981 (for Amsterdam and yellow-nosed albatrosses), 1994 (for sooty albatrosses) and 1997 (for rockhopper penguins). In addition, about 60 pairs of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus currently breed on the Plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res, but so far no long-term monitoring data are available for this species.",

The genetic relationships of this ST with other lineages are shown on a minimum-spanning tree built using data from 969 isolates available on Pasteurella multocida MLST database.

Our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially for three species since previous reports published 13 years ago [16]. In Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, the overall breeding success has remained below 15% for the past 15 years, and the occasional higher success years observed during the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s have become scarcer. Sooty albatrosses have suffered an abrupt decline in reproductive success between 1995 and 2005 with total breeding failure since 2011. The situation has also worsened for the northern rockhopper penguin, with zero fledging since 2013 and a nearly 82% population decrease over the past 22 years. In contrast, the Amsterdam albatross breeding population has increased and breeding success has been high on average, apart from three years (1990, 2000 and 2001) of high chick mortality. As P. multocida was detected in this species and their nests are situated only 2\u20133 km away from the cliffs where Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, sooty albatrosses and northern rockhopper penguin breed, we would expect a higher impact of outbreaks on the Amsterdam albatross population. In this species, nests are widely interspersed, with very low density over the plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res (~0.2 nest/ha) contrary to high nest densities in colonies of northern rockhopper penguin (~3,500 nests/ha) or Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses (~3,100 nests/ha). It is possible that this low nest density limits the spreading of infectious diseases and hence its impact on the population [18]. However, a comprehensive exploration of the epizootiology of outbreaks occurring on Amsterdam Island is required to estimate the intensity of threat for this Critically Endangered species.",

However, strong temporal dynamics has been reported for these infectious agents in wild birds [45], suggesting that the detection failure may reflect an absence of targeted agents at time of bird sampling. Hence, although the circulation of these agents cannot be definitively ruled out on the basis of this study, there is no evidence suggesting that they may be involved in massive mortalities of Indian yellow-nosed and sooty albatross chicks. In contrast, PCR screening confirmed the circulation of P. multocida and E. rhusiopathiae, both previously reported in 1995\u20131996 [16]. At least one individual of each study species carried one of these two bacteria, but no coinfection was detected. In Amsterdam albatrosses, both bacteria were detected although with low prevalence (9.5%, 95% confidence interval: 0\u201322.1). One live chick tested positive for P. multocida and one other for E. rhusiopathiae. Surprisingly, no adult Indian yellow-nosed albatross (out of 50 tested) tested positive for any of these bacteria at the time of sampling. In contrast, a high prevalence of shedding adult brown skuas was found for P. multocida, although this may be affected by our limited sample size (16 tested birds). Skuas are predator and scavenger birds that frequently visit the Indian yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross and northern rockhopper penguin colonies in search of unattended eggs and chicks. Moreover, skuas and Amsterdam albatrosses breed in the same area (Plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res, Fig 2). Predation or scavenging of infected animals can play a role in the epizootiology of avian cholera [17,18]. Several scavenger species have been reported to become chronically infected with P. multocida, which could greatly facilitate their ability to spread the bacteria to new sites [17,46,47]. It is thus conceivable that skuas are involved in P. multocida inter-species transmission on Amsterdam Island and represent a risk for the Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross, although such hypothesis requires thorough investigation.",

In the wild, the disease primarily affects densely aggregating bird species such as waterfowl and seabirds [46]. Several severe outbreaks of avian cholera in seabirds of the Southern Ocean have been previously reported [47\u201351]. Our study and the previous report from Weimerskirch [16] suggest that avian cholera could have become endemic within Amsterdam Island seabirds since the 1980\u2019s. These outbreaks may continue to significantly affect population trends and thus threatens the persistence of these seabird populations.",

On Amsterdam Island, chicks appear more susceptible than adults, while opposite trends have been reported in several duck species [17]. Factors accounting for this age-and species-dependent susceptibility remain unknown. Little is known about factors influencing immunity and resistance or tolerance of seabird hosts exposed to infectious agents. In the house finch Haemorhous mexicanus-Mycoplasma gallisepticum system, complex interactions between variability in the virulence of Mycoplasma strains and in the immune response of host individuals and populations have been suggested to explain differential epidemiological dynamics [52].

Firstly, chickens were introduced in the early 1960\u2019s and raised until 2007 in an open-air enclosure on Amsterdam as a food resource for the base. Contacts between poultry and brown skuas have been observed during that period with skuas occasionally landing within the poultry enclosure searching for food, and one can reasonably assume that this may have led to the initial spread of P. multocida on the island. Secondly, humans may also have contributed to the spread of these infectious agents throughout the island when commuting and/or conducting research activities into seabird colonies. Since 2011, stringent biosecurity measures have been set-up and implemented to limit access to the seabird breeding areas and hence reduce the likelihood of pathogen spread through human activities. Thirdly, mammals are known to host and transmit P. multocida to poultry [57,58], so one could expect the introduced brown rat to play a role in the local circulation of this pathogen. Brown rats were accidently introduced at least one century ago by boats onto the island, where they now roam, including within seabird colonies. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may be involved in the transmission and/or maintenance (see below) of P. multocida, the absence of bird die-offs in the 1980\u2019s suggests that rats may not be at the origin of the introduction of these infectious agents on the island.",

In this study, the identification of P. multocida as the cause of several epizootics paves the way for further investigations and the subsequent implementation of specific control actions. The mechanisms of bacterial inter-season maintenance and the elucidation of transmission pathways during the breeding seasons must be urgently assessed. The putative role of brown rats as maintenance hosts has been extensively documented in other situations [58\u201360] and rats could actually be maintaining the bacteria between breeding seasons while seabirds are absent from the island [55,56]. In addition, rats and seabird chicks are both preyed by brown skuas, which may transmit the bacteria from rodents to albatrosses and between albatrosses. Sampling and screening of rats and skuas during and after the breeding season is thus urgently needed to assess their roles in bacterial maintenance and transmission. Lastly, abiotic reservoirs such as wetlands have also been investigated in other Pasteurella outbreaks in wild birds [61]. Hence ponds, soil and nests within the colonies could also serve as a source of infection and should be explored.",
