PVR is the most common cause of recurrent retinal detachment after retinal detachment repair, occurring in 5%\u201311% of patients [10,11]. Basic research has indicated that PVR is characterized by the formation of scar-like fibrous tissue containing myofibroblasts derived from transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and other cell types, such as glial cells, that have entered the vitreous cavity and induced the contraction of cellular membranes within the vitreous cavity on both detached retinal surfaces [12-14].",

            "text": "Dispase is a heterogeneous protein, and its intravitreal injection may cause some immune reaction and ocular change, not only in the vitreous and retina, but also in the anterior chamber. The autoimmune hypothesis has been prompted by the observation that a PVR-like disease can be induced in rabbits by immunization with the retinal autoantigens opsin, antigen S, and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein [15]. Also apparently supporting the autoimmune hypothesis is the fact that PVR patients display signs of active immune processes in their epiretinal or subretinal membranes, vitreous cavities, subretinal fluids, and serum samples [16-22]. Similar signs of immune activation have been reported for the cells present in the vitreous cavities and subretinal fluids of PVR patients [19,23-26]. Sera of PVR patients have been reported to contain increased concentrations of S-antigen (S-Ag) [27] and S-Ag-specific autoantibodies [28]. The induction of these autoantibodies in particular implies that after iatrogenic eye injury, the exposure to S-Ag triggers an autoantigen-specific B cell response. Since autoantibody production of protein self-antigens is strictly dependent on cluster of differentiation (CD)4 T cell help [29], the presence of these antibodies also implies an autoimmune T cell response against these self-proteins. Thus, these autoreactive T and B cells could conceivably mediate the pathology underlying PVR. While the above findings are consistent with an autoimmune hypothesis for PVR, they do not prove it, and it has been difficult to establish whether the immune reactions seen represent the cause or merely an epiphenomenon of the disease [30].",

The single-cell suspensions were plated in complete RPMI 1640 and added at 1\u00d7105 cells per well to the 96-well plates. In each well, dispase (Gibco, Tokyo, Japan) was added as a stimulus at 0.02 U/ml; as a positive control, 2 \u03bcg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Fluka, Sigma, Carlsbad, CA) was added in the absence of dispase. Finally, as a negative control, PBS was added in the absence of dispase. After 20 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C in CO2 incubators and washing, 2 \u03bcg/ml of biotinylated antimouse-IFN-\u03b3 detection Ab (BD) in PBS/BSA (BSA)/Tween (10 g/l BSA with 0.5% Tween) and 2 \u03bcg/ml antimouse-IL-2 detection Ab (BD) in PBS/BSA/Tween (10 g/l BSA with 0.5% Tween) were added. After 2 h incubation at room temperature and washing three times with PBS/Tween, 100 uL/well of streptavidin- horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:100 dilution; BD) in PBS/BSA/Tween was added for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS/Tween, followed by PBS. The 3-amino-9-ethylcarba (AEC) working solution was freshly prepared by mixing 9.8 ml AEC substrate solution (BD) with 200 \u03bcl AEC chromogen solution (BD); 100 ul of the mixture was plated per well. The plates were developed for 15\u201320 min, after which the reaction was stopped by rinsing with tap water. The plates were air dried overnight and read by the Champ Spot II ELISpot reader (Sage Creation, Beijing, China). The indicated spot numbers per well represent the mean values of three replicates.",

Compared with these revulsants, dispase is easily available and does not lead to exogenous cell development in the PVR model. Hence, in the mouse PVR model, dispase induced a PVR-like condition with a strong contribution of macrophage- and glial-derived cells [1]. Regarding the rabbit PVR model, several authors have reported effects of matrix metalloproteinases [4] and a DNA-RNA chimeric ribozyme-targeted proliferating cell nuclear antigen [5]. Researchers have also reported M\u00fcller glial cells displaying upregulation of purinergic P2 receptor\u2013mediated responses [6,7] and the interaction of cell surface molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, cytoskeletal elements [8], and a foldable capsular vitreous body [9] in PVR. However, due to complications such as cataracts and lens dissolution after dispase injection, the eye fundi of mice have been impossible to observe via microscope in this and other studies [31]. Therefore, we modified the PVR development from the five scores used by Suburo\u2019s group [1] to three scores. Once cataracts and uneven irises occur, tractional retinal detachment is inevitable in model eyes. We confirmed this result based on the H&E and immunofluorescence analysis of the frozen sections.",

These neutrophils might represent separate events in the etiology of PVR. In addition, no CD3+ labeled T cells, F4/80+ labeled macrophages, or CD56+ labeled NK cells appeared in the vitreous cavities or retinas before 5 days.

            "text": "The role of inflammatory and immune cells in PVR membranes in the late stage of PVR has been reported in several studies [1,18,26,41]. Suburo\u2019s group showed that CD3 immunoreactivity was not detected in saline- or dispase-injected eyes [1]. T lymphocytes were found in five of the eight subretinal membranes. CD4+ T cells were demonstrated in four of the membranes and CD8+ T cells in one of the membranes. T cells bearing the IL-2 receptor were found in two of four membranes studied. Macrophages were found in four membranes. No B lymphocytes or neutrophils were observed, and there were no significant deposits of complement or immunoglobulins [18]. The findings of Canataroglu et al. suggest that IL-6 and IL-8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), PVR, and traumatic PVR. Cytological examination of the vitreous specimens revealed a predominance of macrophages (50%) in the PDR samples and a predominance of RPE cells (60%) in the PVR samples. In contrast, neutrophils predominated (88%) in the traumatic PVR samples [26]. Using the monoclonal antibodies EBM11 (pan macrophage) and 27E10 (early inflammatory stage marker), Esser et al. [41] observed that macrophages were predominantly found in traumatic PVR. Inflammatory stage macrophages could not be detected in PVR following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and idiopathic macular pucker. In a previous study, T lymphocytes were found in 18 of the 21 PVR specimens and generally constituted a small percentage of the total cell number. CD4+ T cells were found in 14 of the 18 membranes containing T cells. Three of six frozen membranes contained T cells that were positive for the IL-2 receptor. Cells positive for the macrophage/monocyte marker were found in five of the 16 membranes studied. No B lymphocytes or neutrophils were observed, and there were no deposits of complement or immunoglobulins [42].",

Clinically significant PVR with retinal detachment developed in 75% of mice at 8 weeks, which is very similar to the 75% of mice [1] and 76% of rabbits [4] previously reported. In our study, for confocal microscopy, double immunostaining for RPE65, GFAP, GS, and a-SMA labeled cells was involved in the development of PVR, which is very similar to other studies [1,43]. GFAP is mainly expressed by astrocytes in the normal retinas of several species. M\u00fcller cells\u2019 staining for GFAP in normal retinas is very faint. However, in pathologically changed retinas, M\u00fcller cells become immunopositive for GFAP in retinal detachment and PVR. GS is a marker for astrocytes. In retinas, many astrocytes with contact to ganglion cells also express GS. A-SMA is expressed by myofibroblasts. However, transdifferentiated RPE cells or macroglial cells (astrocytes as well as M\u00fcller cells) in epiretinal membranes of PVR eyes can also express this molecule. The ERG results further confirmed that the retinal functions of mice had been significantly damaged.",

Although a great deal of information supports the role of the immune system in the development of PVR, the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of PVR is still unclear. Data are sometimes contradictory, and it is difficult to establish whether the immune alterations seen in PVR are causes or consequences [30]. The results of a recent study did not support the assumption that CD44 has a functional role in the pathogenesis of PVR [8]. Although our ELISpot assay showed that INF-\u03b3 was detected in the single-cell suspensions of the T cells of dispase-injected mice at 4 and 8 weeks, when compared with those in the positive control (stimulated with PHA), there were no immune reactions in dispase- or in saline-injected mice (Figure 7). Interestingly, there were few IFN-\u03b3+/CD4+ or IFN-\u03b3+/CD8+ T cells determined by intracellular staining at a maximum of 4 weeks in dispase-injected mice. Thus, the IFN-\u03b3 found was not secreted by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in these mice. It was concluded from these results that specific immune systems do not play a major role in the murine dispase-induced PVR model.",

Triamcinolone acetonide is being used as an anti-inflammatory drug for early-stage treatment, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is being used as an antiproliferation drug in advanced-stage treatment [44,45].
