It is estimated that 1-2 million people in the United States suffer from IBD, approximately half of which have UC. The exact cause of UC was unknown, but it appears to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors [3]. The goal of conventional IBD therapies is mainly to downregulate aberrant immune responses and inflammatory cascades. Conventional drugs for IBD include corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalazine), but these drugs have undesirable side effects, especially steroid therapy, which can cause infertility and developmental disability [4, 5]. IBD patients present diverse symptoms throughout the course of the disease. Some symptoms are directly related to disease activity, while others may be a consequence of therapy. The disease imposes a substantial burden on patients and significantly impacts their functioning and health-related quality of life [6].",

Previously, we showed that a high-molecular-weight fraction (HMF) of C. wilfordii exerted immune-enhancing effects on immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide and on macrophages, and this effect was attributed to the crude polysaccharide [25]. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides of C. wilfordii in a dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced mouse model of colitis and the related mechanism of action have not yet been reported. As polysaccharides may also have anti-inflammatory functions, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides from C. wilfordii on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and on DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice.",

The high-molecular-weight fraction was precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of 95% ethanol. The mixture was allowed to stand at 4\u00b0C overnight and was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min to obtain the precipitate.

Treatment with DSS causes epithelial injury and infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells [32]. Colonic inflammation and mucosal injury were assessed by pathological examination of the colon after H&E staining, and representative results are shown in Figure 2(a). Representative colon tissue sections from mice in the control group showed intact surface epithelium, cryptal glands, stroma, and submucosa. However, colon sections from DSS-treated mice showed branched crypts, cryptitis, decreased numbers of crypts and goblet cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, and extensive submucosal edema. In contrast, HMFO treatment improved the signs of histological damage, such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 2(a)). Mice treated with DSS alone had significantly elevated histological scores, compared with those of healthy control mice. However, the histological score decreased to approximately 57% of that in the DSS-treated group when treated with the highest HMFO concentration (200 mg/kg) (Figure 2(b)). These results suggested that HMFO treatment protected against acute DSS-induced colitis. To evaluate the protective effects of HMFO against leukocyte infiltration in colonic tissue, we measured the levels of MPO, a marker of leukocyte infiltration in the colon tissue. MPO is an enzyme that is produced mainly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is specific to granulocyte lysosomes. Therefore, MPO is directly correlated with the number of neutrophils [33]. As shown in Figure 2(c), DSS-treated mice showed a significant increase in MPO activity compared to that in control mice, and this increase was drastically decreased in the HMFO-treated group. Therefore, the increase in MPO activity in tissues induced by DSS correlated with the development of colonic inflammation, and HMFO administration markedly suppressed MPO accumulation in colonic tissues.",

Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the DSS-treated group than in the control group. However, IL-6 levels in mice treated with HMFO (100 and 200 mg/kg) were lower than those in the DSS-treated group (Figure 3(a)). Serum TNF-\u03b1 levels were also increased in DSS-treated mice compared with the normal control group, while HMFO-treated mice had lower serum TNF-\u03b1 concentrations than DSS-treated mice (Figure 3(b)). Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that HMFO at 200 mg/kg markedly reversed the increase in IL-6- and TNF-\u03b1-positive cells (brown stained) in the colonic mucosa of DSS-induced mice (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). High levels of proinflammatory cytokine production are a major characteristic of DSS-induced colitis [34, 35]. In DSS-induced acute colitis, enormous infiltrates appeared in inflammatory lesions, mainly consisting of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, which produce various proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-17 [34, 36, 37]. In the colon of patients with IBD, markedly increased numbers of mast cells and macrophages were observed, and these cells might contribute to abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as NO and TNF-\u03b1 [38].",

As shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b), iNOS and COX-2 expression levels significantly increased in the colon tissues from DSS-treated mice compared to those in normal mice. However, HMFO administration remarkably reduced iNOS protein upregulation and significantly decreased DSS-induced COX-2 expression, down to normal levels with different doses of HMFO (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The COX-2 and iNOS enzymes represent important molecular targets in the treatment and prevention of IBD, and their expression and activity are associated with disease severity, suggesting their potential as anti-inflammation drug targets. During active inflammation, bacteria can enter the lamina propria due to cell destruction and increased permeability. Inflammatory cytokines and bacterial antigens induce and drive the transcription of both COX-2 and iNOS, and these proinflammatory enzymes are also upregulated in murine experimental colitis and active human IBD [39, 40]. Our data clearly demonstrated that colonic damage was associated with elevated expression of both COX-2 and iNOS proteins, and HMFO administration potently downregulated their expression levels. In a similar study, pomegranate polyphenols and resveratrol decreased COX-2 and iNOS overexpression in murine experimental colitis [41, 42].",

Therefore, the effect of HMFO on NF-\u03baB activation in mice with DSS-induce colitis was investigated. DSS administration significantly elevated the phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the colon tissue compared to those in the control group. However, HMFO treatment drastically attenuated NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, which was comparable in HMFO-treated and control mice (Figure 4(c)). These results suggested that HMFO can inhibit the activation of transcription factors in mice with DSS-induced colitis and may be an effective and promising treatment for UC.",

As shown in Figure 5(a), HMFO significantly decreased LPS-induced NO production in a dose-dependent manner, with >58% inhibition at 25 \u03bcg/mL HMFO, a nontoxic concentration. NO is synthesized by iNOS and is a well-known proinflammatory mediator involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Suppression of NO production has been suggested as a new pharmacological strategy for treating inflammation-related diseases [45]. As shown in Figures 5(b) and 5(c), iNOS expression at both the mRNA and protein levels significantly increased following LPS stimulation. However, iNOS mRNA and protein levels in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were significantly reduced by treatment with HMFO. These results indicated that HMFO suppressed NO production by suppressing iNOS gene expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. The iNOS gene is the primary regulator of NO production in macrophages, and iNOS inhibitors have been found to attenuate osteoarthritis [46], periodontitis [47], septic shock [48], and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "In summary, our results suggest that HMFO inhibited the expression of several cytokines and enzymes involved in inflammation, such as PGE2, NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 by attenuating NF-\u03baB and MAPKs in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, HMFO ameliorated the pathological characteristics of colitis, such as shortened colon length, and significantly reduced the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Histological analysis indicated that HMFO improved the signs of histological damage such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by DSS. In addition, HMFO inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression and the levels of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 in the colon tissue of mice with DSS-induced colitis. These results indicated that HMFO attenuated inflammation both in vitro and in vivo primarily by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, our findings indicate that HMFO is an effective and promising remedy for IBDs, such as colitis.",
