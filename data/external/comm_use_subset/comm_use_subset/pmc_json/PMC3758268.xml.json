This approach allows an accurate calculation of the mean and possibly other moments. However, an obvious drawback of such an approach is that the estimate itself gives no understanding of the underlying mechanics, and hence it is difficult to make predictions with quantifiable confidence or to assess the impact of proposed control policies. This is because the serial interval is not a biological quantity in its own right but the convolution of the processes of transmission and incubation. This is further confounded by the fact that the time of infection is almost certainly unobservable, and because households are small, depletion of susceptibles has a large impact on the (stochastic) transmission process [14]. For these reasons, the only way to infer both epidemiological and dynamical quantities from serial interval data is by assuming and fitting a transmission model [15], [16]. This approach not only provides an estimate of the serial interval distribution, but estimates a full mechanistic model which may be used to make predictions and assess the impact of intervention policies [6].",

In these it is assumed that there are two levels of mixing: strong mixing within a household and weaker mixing between households [17]. As the overall population is assumed to be large and randomly mixing, then during the early stages of an epidemic repeated introduction of infection into a single household is negligible. The assumption of only one introduction allows for deeper analysis of the model, and also allows for computationally-efficient methods to be developed for evaluating early-time quantities [17], [21]; here it allows us to ignore the external infection rate, and use serial interval data to estimate the other parameters. Obviously during the mid-to-late stages of an outbreak, this assumption breaks down and hence more complex models are required, but for this study we confine ourselves to this common assumption. This early stage of an epidemic is important as we want to infer parameters which can then be used (with further assumptions) in population level models to assess possible interventions and inform public health policy.",

This is achieved by first explaining how the serial interval distribution can be calculated for this model, and hence used to derive exact likelihoods. We then use this for parameter inference via Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We investigate the accuracy of this methodology via simulation studies and illustrate its use with data previously studied from a household transmission study of seasonal influenza in Hong Kong [13]. Our investigations identify that household size has an appreciable impact on the serial interval distribution and that incorporating household size data into inference methods allows more accurate estimates of model parameters.",

Thirdly, it is very computationally efficient. This means we can achieve the methodological ideal of full evaluation of the uncertainty in parameter estimates and derive accurate credible intervals for all results. Efficiency also allows for the potential inclusion of much more epidemiological detail in future models were more data available in such studies.",

We used the following binning to calculate the probability of observing a secondary case on the  th day [4],(7)where  is the cdf and  is the maximum range of observations. Given a set of index-secondary case observations, the likelihood of observing them is multinomial with probabilities .

This is because there is a trade-off between more people competing to show symptoms and the fact that these must have been infected later than the first person.

Of course, one must be careful in using household quantities to make population level predictions [9]; to do this we typically need to make more assumptions about population level mixing and transmission. In related work on antiviral effectiveness [6] we have used this method with a simpler model to effectively estimate the exposed period parameter  and infectious period parameter  from a larger influenza serial interval dataset [4]. Although this dataset was larger, the data was not stratified by household size, so we had to use a mean household size in our estimation.

For example, we have not explicitly accounted for external infection and co-primary cases, varying infectiousness with stage of infection, or symptoms that do not coincide with the commencement of infectiousness. It possible to extend the model to account for these features, and the method we have outlined will also need to be modified slightly to accommodate these extensions. We note that in all cases extra parameters will require estimation. We are currently developing and testing such frameworks. However, the model we have explicitly analysed herein is of much interest in infectious disease modelling, and the method we have detailed will facilitate its use in the early stages of disease invasion, of much interest to public health policy.",

Throughout we have assumed frequency-dependent transmission, as appears to be most appropriate for influenza in households [15], but one would expect the differences to be exacerbated by density-dependent transmission \u2013 not only do larger households have more individuals competing to display symptoms first, but the transmission rate would also be larger for the same household configuration which further reduces the serial interval. Household size is typically recorded alongside the serial interval, so our method simply proposes a way to make appropriate use of this routinely collected data; an approach which has the benefit of producing posterior distributions of parameters corresponding to a fully-mechanistic model of the disease dynamics.",
