Furthermore, these antivirals are often costly and are ultimately susceptible to escape mutant selection. Simple point substitutions are often responsible for treatment failure,4, 5 while fitness costs associated with harbouring these substitutions may be trivially absorbed by the escaped strain upon accumulating compensatory adaptations.6 Tenofovir is an example of a highly effective single\u2010regimen treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection, a retro\u2010transcribing virus characterised by considerable genetic heterogeneity, by simultaneously imposing potent viral suppression, a high barrier for escape and reduced replicative fitness of escape strains. Despite these synergising effects, complex escape mutants harbouring multiple point substitutions in the viral reverse transcriptase have recently emerged.7 One way of enhancing treatment efficacy while minimising viral escape is to deploy existing antivirals as combination therapies, a strategy used extensively in current HIV (e.g. tenofovir/emtricitabine) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment regimens.4, 5 While increasing the number of combinations increases the height of the escape barrier, proportional increases in treatment costs, adverse effects and counterindications make this strategy one of ever compounding challenges that ultimately remains exposed to the core problem of viral resistance. Treatment failure and the continuous need for the development of additional therapies are the realised costs of playing into such \u2018strengths\u2019 of virus evolution.",

Nevertheless, this same process that enables remarkable genome plasticity also appears to limit the incorporation of new information with which to achieve more favorable host manipulation. There exists an inverse relationship between viral genome size and mutation rate, with large coronaviruses the only known RNA virus family to possess 3\u2032\u2010exonuclease proofreading activity.16 Thus, the probability of acquiring a lethal mutation increases as a function of both polymerase infidelity and genome size. This suggests lengthening the genome to accommodate a larger repertoire of gene products with which to better manipulate the host comes with considerable fitness trade\u2010offs for RNA viruses. Indeed, excepting extremely small circular ssDNA viruses, RNA virus genomes are typically far shorter than DNA virus genomes in both average size (10.3 vs. 77.8 kb, respectively) and maximal size (51.3 vs. 2474 kb) and encode fewer proteins (1\u201328 vs. 1\u20131839; Figure 1). As a result, while various RNA viruses tolerate certain gene substitutions (e.g. recombinant reporter strains and segmented genome viruses),17 most are poorly tolerant of additions of new genetic information. Correspondingly, mutagenic nucleoside analogues exhibit broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity by increasing the error rate in genome synthesis for nascent viral particles.18 This effectively reduces the optimal genome length of the virus for productive infection to below the threshold of viability, thereby driving the population to extinction. Therefore, while the core \u2018strengths\u2019 in RNA virus evolution arise because of the nature of their genetic material and its error\u2010prone mode of replication, these appear intractably coupled to limits on the size of information available to subvert their more complex hosts.",

Imbricated dependency on multifunctional host proteins for various key replication steps creates vulnerabilities that may be exploited for highly efficacious antiviral therapies. For example, denying such host proteins to the virus may disrupt multiple key elements in its replication strategy. Where these proteins represent foci of evolutionary convergence, such therapies may yield robust, broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity. The degree of innovation required to circumvent such a therapy and, especially in the case of RNA viruses, the informational barrier to realising this innovation may be high. Escape mutants that emerge may be forced to overcome multiple deficiencies simultaneously and suffer compounding fitness penalties in the process. Furthermore, host\u2010oriented approaches present a much larger list of potential therapeutic targets than the dozen or so gene products produced by most human\u2010infective RNA viruses, many of which are challenging targets in the first instance because of genetic diversity and intrinsic protein disorder.19 Given the higher fidelity of DNA versus RNA replication, host therapeutic targets may prove resilient to certain mechanisms of viral resistance. Altogether, these advantages may reduce antiviral development costs over the long term, allowing for greater treatment accessibility and faster development of future therapies. But which host proteins are sufficiently multifunctional? And how might these present viable therapeutic substrates?",

In addition to V's established roles in suppressing multiple components of host interferon (IFN) signalling,23 these interactions may allow MV to interface with the cytoskeleton (vimentin) and subvert numerous host cell processes including cell cycle (p53, hnRNPK), protein translation (PABP1), RNA metabolism (PABP1, hnRNPK), and transcription and protein expression (HSP90a). V is produced by editing of the P gene transcript, which also overlaps with the C gene. The largest number of amino acid substitutions between wild\u2010type MV and attenuated vaccine strains occurs within the P/V/C gene region,24 suggesting changes in this region serve an important basis for natural attenuation. Since attenuated MV strains possess very limited capacity for reversion,24 MV strains engineered to harbour defects in V binding to these host proteins may be suitable designer vaccine candidates.

One advantage of this approach is the likely greater amenability of previously uncultivable or poor\u2010yielding viruses for cultivation ex vivo. Additionally, the resulting strain will likely preserve some replicative competence upon inoculation, thereby eliciting stronger immunity in the absence of adjuvants. The challenge remains, however, to identify which parts of the cell or culture methods should be modified to generate broad permissiveness, high titres and greatly reduced virulence simultaneously. Obvious candidates include genes that restrict viral replication but are dispensable for cell survival, such as IFN genes and their signalling components, and potentially certain multifunctional proteins. Taken to its logical conclusion, it should be possible to genetically engineer an immune\u2010null human cell substrate within which to passage virus free of virulence factor targets and immune selective pressure. In this way, the strain that emerges will likely exhibit strong antigenicity but severe degradation in mechanisms of host immune antagonism. Such an approach may also prove useful in the context of viruses that cause severe disease primarily through cytokine hyperactivation.",

Organoids and other stem cell\u2010derived tissues represent one approach under recent and intensifying examination. Human lung organoids have been demonstrated to recapitulate key properties of RSV pathogenesis,106 and human intestinal epithelium has been developed for previously uncultivable norovirus.104 Additionally, incorporating multiple tissue\u2010specific miRNA\u2010targeting sequences within the attenuated viral genome may improve vaccine safety by impairing its ability to replicate within inflammation\u2010sensitive or irreplaceable tissues. Inversely, this same strategy may be used to help guide infection of certain tissues such as oncolytic viruses in the case of cancer immunotherapy.100 Another safety feature could involve a drug\u2010selective \u2018kill switch\u2019, whereby key viral proteins are fused to the FK506\u2010binding protein 12 destabilisation domain.

These viruses are also suggested to readily generate genes de novo.13 While few complete genome sequences of such viruses are currently available, most of the numerous proteins encoded by these vast viral genomes are entirely novel.108, 110, 111 If the process for de novo generation of viral genes can be harnessed, this could support efforts at directed evolution of new and useful biological functions.",

Despite being intractably limited in informational size, RNA viruses are thorough problem solvers, often subverting multitasking host proteins to achieve favorable host subversion at minimal informational cost. Such solutions to the viral information economy paradox are often conserved, creating opportunities to leverage imbricated multidependency on key host proteins for host\u2010oriented antiviral therapies that are more effective, broad\u2010acting and ultimately more cost\u2010effective. Although such proteins can present challenging therapeutic targets, host\u2010oriented therapies will synergise with increased therapeutic drug availability and developments in RNAi, precision medicine and immunotherapy. Additionally, methods of increasing viral antigenicity yet controlling replication and tissue tropism will increase the number of viruses for which safe and highly effective vaccines can be produced. Viruses such as NCLDVs appear to readily acquire new information with which to subvert their hosts. The fruits of problem\u2010solving by such viruses include large numbers of proteins with unique and unknown biological functions. The influence and genetic hallmarks of viruses at both extremes are found in humans and throughout the living biosphere. By expanding the examination of evolutionarily diverse host\u2013virus interactions, disease, cost, environmental and other sustainability issues of our time may be remedied by leveraging, rather than yielding to, the properties of RNA and DNA viruses as developed through co\u2010evolution with their hosts.",
