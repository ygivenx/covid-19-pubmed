We chose to test the performance of our ICs (competitive and non-competitive) using the same primers and probes used in this test. The applicability of the competitive and non-competitive ICs for HCV detection was demonstrated in this work. We also showed the applicability of the non-competitive control to HIV-1 detection by real-time PCR, although the reaction should be optimised to establish an ideal concentration of the IC that does not interfere with HIV-1 amplification, as has been done for HCV. We showed the results for one-step real-time RT-PCR, but the real-time PCR for HCV using our ICs were also successful and reproducible in a two-step format (data not shown).",

Another advantage of using a plasmid containing the MS2 sequence is that the replication of the plasmid via the bacterial DNA polymerase generates fewer mutations than the MS2 replication by its RNA polymerase (replicase) (Fiers et al. 1976). The avoidance of the risk of contamination of laboratory bacterial stocks and the non-generation of mutations by replication through RdRP are advantages of the pseudoviral particles use and our competitive IC satisfied those requirements (Pasloske et al. 1998).",

Those two works did not use any IC. Villanova et al. (2007) developed a competitive control for HCV diagnostics based on another virus, Q\u03b2, and obtained a detection limit 500 IU/mL. The work of Dreier et al.

Our system was able to detect 250 IU/mL, a value that is comparable with Fiocruz\u2019s test.
