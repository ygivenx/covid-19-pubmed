Calves are born hypogammaglobulinemic and require colostrum to supply immunoglobulins during the neonatal period. Neonatal calf health is largely dependent on the ingestion and absorption of maternally derived antibodies via colostrum consumption [5]. Failure of passive transfer (inadequate circulating IgG concentration) in calves is a common condition that predisposes calves to increased morbidity and mortality and there is a link between low serum globulins and the incidence of infectious diseases [6]. The importance of the ingestion and absorption of colostral immunoglobulins on morbidity, mortality, growth, and future productivity of dairy calves has been described [7]. Calves with inadequate passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins have an increased risk of death during the first 3 months after birth [8], a decreased rate of weight gain [9], and a decreased survival rate until the end of the first lactation [10, 11].",

The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Care at University of Milan (http://www.unimi.it/cataloghi/comitato_etico/CE_19dic2012_verbale.pdf). A closed-collection system was used, consisting of sterile human 450 mL blood bags (TERUMO CPDA-1 triple blood bag, GRIFOLS, Italy) containing 20 mL of citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine-1 (CPDA-1) anticoagulant, used to collect blood from each cow. From each cow 8 bags of whole blood were collected. Whole blood was collected in a standard fashion from each cow by jugular venipuncture, using a 16-gauge needle attached to a triple-bag closed-collection system on a blood mixer. The closed-collection system consisted of a primary bag containing 63 mL of citrate phosphate-double dextrose solution as anticoagulant, an additive bag that contained 100 mL of additive solution (SAG-Mannitol), and 1 empty satellite bag.",

In this study the maximal percentage of variation observed between fresh and frozen plasma was not considered clinically relevant and would not be expected to lead to misinterpretation of the results [17]. Thus, this study demonstrates that in bovine plasma stored at \u221220\u00b0C changes in protein fractions occur in TP, ALB, and beta-2 globulin expressed as g/dL after 1 month and 6 and 12 months. Since one of the main reasons for use of bovine frozen plasma is the passive transfer of immunity for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia in calves, the preservation of the gamma globulin fraction is essential. In our study there was no difference between the gamma globulin fraction expressed as g/dL and the percentage in fresh and thawed plasma at any time of storage studied. So bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer of immunity) in calves when stored for 12 months at \u221220\u00b0C.",
