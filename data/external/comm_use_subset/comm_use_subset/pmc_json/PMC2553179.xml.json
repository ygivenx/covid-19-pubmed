This is the case in the formation of virus replication complexes, coordinated functions between different viral proteins, assembly of virions, and counter-defense of host immune responses. Analysis of protein-protein interactions is essential to understand protein functions and the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. As the viral genomes are of limited sizes, they are particularly well suited for genome-wide analysis of all possible protein-protein interactions. However, the viral protein interaction maps have been generated until now only for a limited number of viruses, including T7 bacteriophage [1], vaccinia virus [2], potato virus A [3], pea seed-borne mosaic virus [3], wheat steak mosaic virus [4], hepatitis C virus [5], [6], porcine teschovirus [7], Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [8], and very recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [9], [10].",

Until now, all the genome-wide analysis of protein interaction networks for viruses and cells have been carried out mainly with the yeast two-hybrid systems, in combination with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays to verify major interactions [8], [9]. Considering that protein modifications that are likely to influence protein interactions may be different for certain proteins in the context of yeast and mammalian cells, the mammalian two-hybrid system may better reflect genuine protein interactions for human viruses. Accordingly, we adopted the mammalian two-hybrid system for detecting genome-wide protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV.",

The genome of SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA of approximately 29.7 kb in length. Fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, of which 12 are located in the 3\u2032 end of the genome [11], [12]. The two large ORFs (1a and 1b) in the 5\u2032-proximal two-third of the genome encode the viral replicase and are translated directly from the genomic RNA, while ORF 1b is expressed by \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting. The large polypeptides encoded by 1a and 1b are considered to be cleaved into 16 functional replicase proteins by two proteinases, a papain-like proteinase 2 encoded by nsp3 and a 3C-like proteinase (or main proteinase) encoded by nsp5 [12].",

            "text": "A number of functions or characteristics have been identified for the 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). Nsp1 was proved to be able to suppress host gene expression by promoting host mRNA degradation and was involved in cellular chemokine deregulation [13], [14]. Nsp2 seems not to play a crucial role in the generation of infectious viruses in cell culture [15]. Nsp3 is involved in many activities including papain-like proteinase activity, deubiquitinating activity, and ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase activity [16]\u2013[18], [60], which are essential for viral replication and transcription. Nsp5 encodes a 3C-like proteinase which is considered to be an important target for antiviral drug design [19]. Coronavirus nsp4 and nsp6 are transmembrane proteins that could anchor the replication complexes to double membrane vesicles [20]. Based on the structural analysis, hexadecamer of nsp7 and nsp8 may possess dsRNA-binding activity [21]. Nsp8 was shown to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity that could be involved in producing primers utilized by nsp12 which is normally accepted to be the RdRp for SARS-CoV [22], [23]. Nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein [24]. Though the structure of nsp10 is resolved, its function is still poorly understood, except that of nsp10 of MHV, homologous to that of SARS-CoV, which regulates viral RNA synthesis [25]\u2013[27]. Nsp13 is shown to be RNA helicase and 5\u2032-triphosphatase that may play a crucial role in the viral RNA capping [28], [29]. Nsp14 of coronaviruses possesses a 3\u2032->5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity which may be involved in the proof-reading ability during the viral RNA replication and transcription [30]\u2013[32]. Besides the exoribonuclease activity, SARS-CoV also possesses the endoribonuclease activity that is rendered by nsp15 [33]. According to the bioinformatic prediction, nsp16 and SUD domain of nsp3 of SARS-CoV may function as 2\u2032-O methyltransferase and guanine N7 methyltransferase, respectively [34], [35]. Very recently, the 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity was confirmed experimentally for nsp16 of feline coronavirus [36]. Nsp14, 15 and 16 were shown to be essential for efficient replication of coronavirus [30], [37], [38].",

By using mammalian two-hybrid assays, 40 different interactions between viral proteins have been identified, and six novel interactions could be confirmed in vitro by biochemical assays.

To further show the specificity of the interactions (Fig. 1), a quantitative assay for a typical positive interaction exemplified by nsp10\u2013nsp14 and various controls were shown (Fig. 1B). To test the specificity of individual interactions, competitive assays were performed by co-expression of viral proteins using a different vector within the cells transformed with the bait and prey constructs. The co-expressed partner proteins interfered with the nsp10\u2013nsp14 interaction, leading to reduced reporter activity (Fig. 1C), indicating that the same proteins with different fusion domains competed with each other and impaired the specific interactions needed for activation of the reporter genes.",

Self-interactions of nsp3, nsp5, nsp8, nsp15 and N were observed, suggesting that these proteins could form dimeric or multimeric complexes by interacting with themselves. Furthermore, 8 interactions between non-structural proteins and accessory proteins (3b, 7b, 8b, 9b) and one interaction between non-structural protein nsp16 and structural protein N were detected, indicating that some of the accessory proteins might be involved in viral replication and transcription processes.

A significant increase in luciferase activity, in comparison with that of the parental replicon plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP was observed (Fig. 3B). As the luciferase gene is located in the 3\u2032-end of the genome and under the control of a viral TRS, it can only be expressed from subgenomic RNAs but not from the viral genome RNA. Therefore, expression of luciferase was expected to reflect the genome replication and transcription of SARS-CoV replicon. To further clarify whether the luciferase expression of Rep-SCV-luc/neo derived from the viral replication and transcription processes but not from nuclear splicing products of the large viral replicon RNA during the CMV promoter-driven transcription in nucleus, the positive and negative subgenomic RNAs were examined according to the strategy described in our previous work [39] and the existence of correct subgenomic RNAs was confirmed (data no shown). Moreover, when the gene segment between two MluI restriction sites in viral genome, which encodes nsp4\u2013nsp11 and part of nsp12, was deleted, the construct pBAC-Rep-SCV-\u0394Mlu-luc/neo produced much lower levels of luciferase expression although it still retained detectable level of luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). To analyze the luciferase expression from the MluI deletion mutant, the identity of the luciferase mRNA was sequenced. The results showed that a low level of luciferase mRNA was generated either by cryptic promoters or by splicing of cryptic introns within the replicon transcripts in nucleus but not in the mRNAs derived from the cytoplasmic replication and transcription of the replicon (data not shown). Taken together, these results showed that the reporter-containing SARS-CoV replicon could be used as a model system for analyzing the functions of viral proteins.",

Though most of the viral proteins did not exert significant impact on the replication and transcription of the replicon, the nsp3.1 containing X and SUD domains, and the RNA polymerase nsp12 (Fig. 4A), and nucleocapsid N (Fig. 4B) significantly increased the luciferase activity, whereas nsp3.2 containing the papain-like (PL) proteinase domain reduced the viral replication and transcription. Other proteins, such as nsp10/11, also showed a minor but significant increased expression. These results confirmed that the function of N gene fragment was not resulted from protein 9b that is internally nested in N sequence, as 9b showed no obvious impact on the replication and transcription of replicon when it was co-expressed (Fig. 4B). In addition, these results indicate that nucleocapsid protein, nsp3 and RNA polymerase may possess a dominant function in trans, while the PL proteinase is involved in important cis functions like cis-processing of the large viral polyprotein.",

To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide protein-protein analyses for an intact viral ORFeome by using mammalian two-hybrid system. In our screen, 1.4 protein interactions per viral protein on the average was detected, and this result is in the upper range of the detection rates of viral protein interactions obtained by yeast two-hybrid systems [58]. Therefore, this study indicates that mammalian two-hybrid system can also serve as a convenient system to detect viral protein interactions of the whole ORFeomes.

In contrast, a number of interactions including N-N and nsp15\u2013nsp15 were detected in current study and proved previously by other studies [54]\u2013[57] but they could not be revealed by the yeast two-hybrid systems [9], [10].

Although it is difficult to judge which system offers more biologically relevant results, great caution should be taken when interpreting the interaction data as both two-hybrid screenings as well as biochemical methods may generate false positive and false negative interactions. Nevertheless, the above comparative analysis of overlapping interactions of different systems may suggest that mammalian two-hybrid system could provide more reliable assays for detecting human viral protein interactions. In other scenario, the profiles of SARS-CoV protein interactions revealed by mammalian two-hybrid system (in this work) and yeast systems [9], [10], respectively, may be complementary to each other and jointly serve as a framework for further characterization of protein-protein interactions and their biological functions on coronavirus replication cycle.",

In current screen, only few interactions were detected for the SARS-CoV membrane proteins such as nsp4, M, E and 3a proteins, and no interactions could be detected for nsp1, nsp6, spike and the small transmembrane protein 6, possibly reflecting the limitation of the two-hybrid system.

            "text": "The interactions between nsp10 with nsp14 and nsp16 showed bi-directionality in the mammalian two-hybrid analyses, which could be confirmed in pull-down assays and were also revealed in one of the two yeast-hybrid analyses [10]. Recently, nsp10 was shown to form a dodecameric RNA-binding protein complex [26], [27] involved in regulation of RNA synthesis and polyprotein processing [25], [59]. Nsp14 and nsp16 were proved to play an essential role in viral replication and transcription as shown by mutational analysis [37]. Considering that nsp14 has exoribonuclease activity and could play an essential role in RNA proof-reading activity [30]\u2013[32], and that nsp16 is involved in the viral methyltransferase activity and RNA capping [34], [36], the interactions of nsp10 with nsp14 and nsp16 may indicate that nsp10 could play an important role in the formation of replication complex bound to RNA (i.e., nsp10 could mediate the binding of nsp14 and nsp16 to the RNA) and in the replication/transcription processes. Although no interactions were detected for nsp11, which was predicted to be small polypeptide with 13 amino acids, fusion of nsp11 with nsp10 strengthened the respective interactions of nsp10 with nsp14 and nsp16. These observations may imply that nsp11 could act as a cofactor for nsp10 and the predicted cleavage site between nsp10 and nsp11 may be inefficient in vivo, thus resulting in the production of nsp10/nsp11 fusion protein in cells. Indeed, no evidence for existence of the fully processed nsp11 has been presented in published researches. However, such speculation needs to be confirmed by further investigations.",

For example, nsp7 and nsp8 could associate with each other and thus form a hexadecameric supercomplex with a central channel that has dimensions and positive electrostatic properties favorable for nucleic acid binding [21]. Consistent with our results, self-interactions of N protein and nsp15 have also been revealed and the results indicate that these proteins have the propensity to oligomerize [56], [57], [61]. In this study, a SARS-CoV replicon containing a sensitive luciferase reporter was constructed, with its expression under the control of M gene TRS. In this situation, the reporter activity would indicate the efficiency of both genome replication and transcription. When individual viral proteins were provided in trans to the reporter replicon, most proteins did not exert significant influence on the reporter activity, with exception of nsp3, nsp12 (polymerase), and nucleocapsid protein N. As protein nsp3 is a large multidomain protein, different domains were tested separately in this system. While nsp3.1 that covers domains predicted for adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2033-phosphatase [12] and methyltransferase [35] could enhance the reporter activity, the nsp3.2 had a negative effect, indicating the domains in nsp3.2 may play structural roles in the formation of replication/transcription complex and could behave in a dominant-negative manner when separated from other domains. In accordance with this hypothesis, nsp3.2 was found to associate with itself, nsp4 and nsp12 in this work.",

In this study, we showed that N protein was not absolutely essential for starting the replication but may play important roles at the early stages of genome replication and/or transcription because the reporter replicon in absence of additional N protein provided in trans also resulted in obvious replication and transcription but in lower efficiency and delayed manner. The enhancement effects of N protein phased out at late stage probably when the N protein expressed from the genome had accumulated to certain level. Although the exact mechanisms for N-mediated stimulation activity at early stages are not known, several scenarios could be envisaged, such as protecting viral genome RNA, increasing the translation efficiency of viral RNA, stabilizing replication/transcription protein complex and inhibition of cellular innate immune responses, as is supported by the recent reports on diversified functions of N protein [64], [65].",

The protein mixture was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose that binds GST and GST fusion proteins. Proteins bound by glutathione-Sepharose were resolved in SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and then was detected by anti-MBP rabbit serum. For every assay, GST protein was used as a negative control. For example, to examine the interaction between nsp10 and nsp14, the mixtures of GST-nsp10/MBP-nsp14 and GST/MBP-nsp14 were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose and the proteins pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose were identified by anti-MBP rabbit serum, respectively. The proteins indicated on the left side of the vertical line were MBP fusions and that on the right are GST fusions with \u201c-\u201d indicating non-fused GST as negative control. The star signs indicate the expected bands for MBP-fusion proteins. The smaller bands observed are probably premature proteins or degradation products of the same proteins.",
