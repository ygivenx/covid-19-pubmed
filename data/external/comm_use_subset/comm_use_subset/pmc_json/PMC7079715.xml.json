From the very first (known) cases international expert teams worked together in order to investigate this emerging disease in more detail and to develop reliable diagnostic tools and protocols that can be used to contain the spread of the virus. Sequencing data were generated and released that enabled the development of specific molecular diagnostic assays to detect MERS-CoV and to distinguish it from other related human coronaviruses, like the SARS virus [2]. Up until today, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for MERS available; thus, early case recognition and isolation of infected persons is the only strategy to curb the spread of the virus. Since the virus is detectable shortly after the onset of symptoms and as other diagnostics, such as cell culture are slow and practicable only in specialized laboratories, the specific detection of MERS-CoV RNA via RT-PCR is the method of choice and recommended by WHO [6,16,17].",

According to this recommendations, a suspected MERS-CoV sample is considered positive when it is confirmed with two independent RT-PCR tests targeting different genomic regions [18]. A case with a positive PCR result for a single specific target without further testing but history of potential exposure is considered a probable case. The suggested course of action would be to either perform another PCR or sequencing of a third genomic region (Figure 1) [17,18], ideally with freshly extracted RNA from properly stored specimen [16]. False-negative results may occur due to poor quality of the specimen, collection of specimen late or very early in disease, inappropriate handling or shipment of specimen or due to technical reasons inherent to the performed test, such as virus mutation or PCR inhibition [19]. Proper specimen collection, transport conditions, extraction method and storages of eluates have a major impact on the quality of the RNA and therefore on reliable molecular diagnostic [16,20].",

Therefore, according to the diagnostic protocol recommended by WHO these samples are considered negative for MERS-CoV.

Assays targeting the N gene are known to be slightly less sensitive in comparison to assays targeting upE and orf1a [16,18]. A failure of specific detection due to the sensitivity of the assay cannot be excluded. It is more likely that the all along low amount of MERS-CoV RNA was further decreased throughout the time period of storage and/or the transfer of the specimen. If the specimens would have originated from patients with confirmed exposure to MERS-CoV, these samples would be considered probable cases and reprocessing of the specimens would be highly recommended [19].
