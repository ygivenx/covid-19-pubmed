We detected an association between lower CD4 cell counts and the presence of enteric viruses (norovirus GI/II, rotavirus A, adenovirus 40/41) in this study. Only one virus was detected when CD4 cell count was > 500/\u03bcL. Several studies have associated enteric viruses with more advanced HIV infection, suggesting that CD4 deficiency helps mediate enteric viral replication and infection [22, 30, 31]. Astrovirus has been implicated as a potential opportunistic pathogen but none was detected in this study [32]. A study examining stool from symptomatic HIV patients with diarrhea in London, UK found that adenovirus and rotavirus were associated with significantly lower CD4 cell counts compared to coronavirus or norovirus [21]. Our study found that rotavirus and norovirus were independently associated with lower CD4 cell counts. Adenovirus occurred more frequently at lower CD4 cell counts but was not statistically significant, likely due to small sample size in our study (N = 5).",

When excluding B. hominis, D. fragilis and Aeromonas spp., prevalence of mixed infection was still high at 90% with a mean of 4 organisms per sample. High prevalence of mixed enteropathogens has been demonstrated in stool from residents and travelers in developing countries. For instance, 25% and 53% of stool specimens from asymptomatic travelers and travelers with diarrhea, respectively, had two or more bacterial pathogens present when using molecular techniques [20]. All stool samples from symptomatic Peruvians had mixed enteropathogens present with a mean of 4.4 pathogens per specimen when tested using the FilmArray\u00ae panel [17]. In a longitudinal cohort study of 147 infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh, multiple enteropathogens were also observed in both asymptomatic surveillance and diarrheal stools with the average number of organisms being 4.3 and 5.6, respectively [33]. In contrast, no enteropathogens were detected in non-diarrheal stool samples taken from infants within their first year of life in Virginia, US [33]. Our study has several limitations. Notably, there was no control group for comparison and our overall sample size was not large enough to provide any reliable conclusions on less commonly detected enteropathogens (e.g. Cryptosporidium spp., Campylobacter spp.).",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate this finding in people living with HIV/AIDS in a developing setting using multiplex molecular methods. Most specimens were mixed with diarrheagenic E. coli strains which were similar in prevalence to those seen among diarrheal stools in symptomatic Peruvians [17]. This finding highlights the difficulties in determining colonization versus infection when using extremely sensitive diagnostic methods such as multiplex PCR, and the specific etiological role of each organism in an individual patient. The use of quantitative cutoffs for enteropathogen detection using multiplex PCR has been explored but further clinical studies are needed, especially in developing countries, where high rates of colonization with diarrheagenic strains of E. coli exists [33, 34]. One concern is that inappropriate antimicrobial use may escalate with this technology without a fuller understanding of infection versus colonization. Nevertheless, simplification of these technologies, reduction in cost, and better clinical understanding will undoubtedly enhance patient management.",
