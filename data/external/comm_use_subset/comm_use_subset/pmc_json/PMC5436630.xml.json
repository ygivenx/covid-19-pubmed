The outbreak, which exceeds 28,500 cases [1], has seen sporadic cases exported to the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy, either in the form of repatriation of confirmed cases or by case identification after travellers fell ill after returning from West Africa. Secondary transmission has been recorded in the US[2] and Spain.[3] The transmission of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) differs between aetiological agents. Ebola virus transmission between individuals occurs via direct contact with blood and body fluids[4]; nosocomial transmission is a prominent feature of outbreaks[5] but is not fully understood.[6]",

It is important to consider the probability of EVD or another VHF in a returning traveller alongside alternate differential diagnoses. The importation of VHFs into the UK is extremely rare and other infectious diseases, such as malaria or typhoid, are seen much more frequently. Clinicians will perform a risk assessment for such patients, focussing on the precise location of travel and exposure risks whilst there. All such patients require appropriate assessment and investigations whilst a diagnosis is made, and supportive pathology assays play a key part in this management. These investigations would be performed in pathology laboratories operating at Containment Level 2 (CL2), according to the UK Health and Safety Executive[7]. Such laboratories operate using good laboratory practice, which includes appropriate staff training, risk assessment, restricted access, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as laboratory coats, gloves, and eye protection where applicable. In comparison, Containment Level 4 laboratories are complex facilities consisting of highly secure suites with restricted access, carefully controlled air-handling systems with filtered air, and the meticulous control and inactivation of hazardous waste. Manipulations of Hazard Group 4 pathogens[8] have traditionally been performed at this level of containment.",

Many of these cases presented to routine healthcare settings prior to the diagnosis being made. In most instances, pathology samples were obtained and processed in a routine manner within CL2 laboratories. Evidence from outbreaks strongly indicates that the main routes of transmission of VHF infection are direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membrane) with blood or body fluids, indirect contact with environments contaminated with splashes or droplets of blood or body fluids, and inoculation with sharps. Experts from the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) agree that there is no circumstantial or epidemiological evidence of an aerosol transmission risk from VHF patients.",

Often, these assays were performed prior to the diagnosis being made, yet no transmissions to laboratory workers were recorded (Table 1).[9][10][11][12] In addition, over 9,000 cases of Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) were reported in Turkey between 2002 and 2014, with an estimated minimum 180,000 blood samples processed in routine laboratories with no additional precautions. A review was performed of 51 healthcare exposures that occurred in 9 centres where 4,869 of these patients were managed. Of these, only 2 cases in laboratory staff were identified. One may have been associated with a needle-stick injury and the other with handling samples while not wearing appropriate PPE (gloves).[13] There is no evidence of any risk of transmission when good laboratory practice is followed within a CL2 laboratory. Although it is reassuring that large numbers of samples from patients with CCHF infection have been processed safely in routine laboratories in Turkey, it should be noted that this bunyavirus is rarely transmitted person to person, so the parallels between this and other VHF viruses need to be carefully considered. The potential routes of transmission within a CL2 laboratory setting are, however, the same for all VHF agents.",

An effective and reliable decontamination method will show a reduction of 4 log10.[22] Despite some pathogens causing a very high titre viraemia, the design of IVDMDs reduces their contamination as far as reasonably practicable. The design of IVDMDs means they only require a small volume of blood to perform an analysis. Consequently, when an effective and reliable decontamination method is in place that provides a reduction of 4 log10, this will inactivate any residual enveloped virus within the IVDMD. Decontamination therefore renders the IVDMD safe to use and service after challenge with any enveloped virus.
