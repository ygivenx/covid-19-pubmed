Lack of this regulatory pathway in Cd200\u2013/\u2013mice leads to exacerbation of autoimmune diseases e.g. autoimmune encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis in mice [2]. Immune checkpoints, such as the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R) axis, play a dual role in balancing the immune system during microbial infection [3,5,6]. Moreover, several viruses e.g. human herpesvirus 8 or myxoma virus have CD200 orthologues that can trigger endogenous CD200R [7,8] and regulate myeloid cell function [9]. We previously showed, that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon production and viral clearance, and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis coronavirus infection, particularly in female mice, because CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling [10].",

On the other hand, immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could facilitate an anti-tumor cellular response if activated properly. Elevated levels of CD200 are found in multiple types of cancer and many reports suggest that it is responsible for the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses [14,15]. It was proposed that treatment with blocking anti-CD200 antibodies might be beneficial for patients with CD200-expressing cancers [16]. In addition, we previously showed that the absence of CD200R signaling pathway inhibits the growth of endogenous cancer cells even without CD200 expression in the tumor cells [17]. However, CD200 seems to have a dual role in cancer development and metastasis [4]. In the highly aggressive breast cancer 4THM animal model, the use of CD200R agonists exert a potent inhibitory effect on inflammation-driven carcinogenesis and metastasis [18]. In contrast, CD200-positive squamous cells carcinoma has an enhanced ability to metastasize [19]. Moreover, in the EMT6 breast carcinoma animal model CD200 overexpression results in increased lymph node metastasis [20]. These finding support tumorigenic effects of CD200R signaling in the tumor microenvironment in certain circumstances.",

Classical activation of macrophages is inhibited by CD200 which is expressed on cells in diverse tissues [2]. Koning et al. demonstrated that CD200R is expressed in human and mouse M2 cells [25].

The murine breast mammary carcinoma EMT6, Lewis lung carcinoma LLC and B16F10 melanoma cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), (Hyclone) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma). B16F10-EV and B16F10-CD200 melanoma cells with stable expression of Firefly luciferase were generated by transduction with pMX-luc/neo expression vector with or without full-length mouse CD200 and cultured under neomycin selection. B16F10 melanoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin mixture (Sigma).",

Antibodies were administered 3\u20135 times i.v. at a dose of 100 \u03bcg every third day, starting from day 7 after inoculation of tumor cells. Treatment with agonistic anti-CD200R had no significant effect on the growth of EMT6 tumors (Fig 1A). We analyzed tumor-infiltrating immune myeloid cells according to the gating strategy presented in Fig 1B. Upon anti-CD200R treatment, we found a decrease in the fraction of tumor macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and a simultaneous but smaller, increase in the percentage of CD11b+Ly6C+ cells (Fig 1C). Intratumoral monocytes (CD11b+Ly6C++) and remaining myeloid cells (CD11b+Ly6C-) were not affected by the CD200R agonist (Fig 1C). Anti-CD200R treatment decreased fluorescence of CD200R by flow cytometry using the same antibody clone (OX110) for the detection (Fig 1D), in all analyzed intratumoral immune cell populations, proving tumor penetration by intravenously administered anti-CD200R. Similarly, we analyzed the composition of splenic myeloid cell populations. We found no significant differences in the frequency of these cells (Fig 1E). CD200R expression was significantly decreased in all analyzed populations with the exception of CD11b+Ly6C+ cells (Fig 1F). However, relative differences observed in splenocytes were smaller than in the tumor subpopulations.",

These results were similar to the treatment with OX110 where intratumoral macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) were also significantly decreased (Fig 1C). The fraction of intratumoral CD8+ T cells was not different (Fig 2D). To measure the activity of intratumoral lymphocytes, cells were stimulated ex vivo with PMA/ionomycin and stained for the intracellular cytokine production. We found decreased IFN-\u03b3 (Fig 2E) and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 2F) in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, but these differences were not statistically significant.

These tumor models are known to be more immunogenic and are syngeneic to the C57BL/6 mice strain that has more proinflammatory characteristics. Again we found no significant effect of anti-CD200R on the growth of subcutaneously inoculated LLC (Fig 3A) nor of intravenously inoculated B16F10, resulting mostly in foci formation in the lungs (Fig 3B). Since LLC grew in flat tumors we decided to quantify its growth as a surface, whereas B16F10 growth was monitored by light emitted from luciferase, expressed by tumor cells. Again in LLC tumors, we did not observe any difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations (Fig 3C). Similarly, in the lungs of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, no difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations was found (Fig 3D). We investigated the expression of CD200R and observed a significant decrease of CD200R on intratumoral myeloid cells upon the intravenous treatment with anti-CD200R (Fig 3E), proving penetration of antibody into the subcutaneous LLC tumor.

Both, direct measurements of tumor volume (Fig 4A), as well as bioluminescence (BLI) measurements of the same tumors (Fig 4B), revealed that Cd200-/- mice developed smaller tumors as compared to control WT mice (Fig 4A). B16F10 cells with (B16F10-CD200 cells) or without (B16F10-EV cells) CD200 expression were inoculated i.v. into WT or Cd200-/- mice to see whether tumor-expressed CD200 can affect tumor growth. Intravenously inoculated B16F10 cells disseminate to the lungs and other organs and their growth can be monitored with BLI. Regardless of the CD200 expression in tumor cells, control WT mice had higher tumor burden as compared to Cd200-/- mice (Fig 4C and 4D), similarly to the subcutaneous tumor models (Fig 4A and 4B). Although the lung tumor burdens after inoculation of B16F10-CD200 and B16F10-EV cells was comparable in WT mice, the CD200 negative tumors grew significantly slower in the lungs of Cd200-/- mice as compared to CD200 expressing melanomas (Fig 4C and 4D). These results indicate that tumor development is accelerated by both endogenous and tumor-derived CD200 expression. CD200R-signaling affects the growth and progression of cancer, however, its precise mechanism of action is not clear. Lack of CD200 expression inhibits endogenous skin tumors development [17]. Additionally, expression of CD200 on cancer cells correlates with poor patient prognosis [14] and increases the frequency of immunosuppressive Treg cells [20]. All these indicate a positive effect of CD200R on tumor growth by inhibition of the antitumor response. However, a tumor-supportive effect is also possible when CD200R signaling inhibits the activity of pro-tumor myeloid cells [19,26]. The dominant effect probably depends on tumor immunogenicity, composition of myeloid cells expressing the CD200R and the tumor inflammation.",

Triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R reduces CD200-negative melanoma tumor formation in the lungs particularly via inhibition of a Gr1+ myeloid cell population, that feasibly protects metastatic cancer cells from surveillance by immune cells [26]. Importantly, cancer cells used in that study overexpressed ovalbumin, a strong adjuvant able to induce an adoptive anticancer response. In our study, injection of agonistic anti-CD200R antibodies as a monotherapy did not affect the growth of CD200-negative subcutaneous tumors: melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma in syngeneic tumor models. This suggests that in the absence of immunogenic antigen, e.g. OVA, agonistic anti-CD200R is not effective in the presence of endogenous CD200. Using CD200-positive and CD200-negative melanoma tumor cells, we showed that lack of CD200-CD200R interaction in a Cd200-/- host does inhibit tumor growth of CD200-negative cells. Expression of CD200 either on host or melanoma cells promotes tumor cell growth. However, triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R did not further enhance tumor growth.",
