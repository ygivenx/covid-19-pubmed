RIG-I and MDA5 have been characterized as important cytoplasmic sensors for viral RNA [3]\u2013[6]. Once activated by dsRNA molecules, RIG-I and MDA5 are recruited to the mitochondrial adaptor protein know as Mitochondrial AntiViral Signaling (MAVS) (also called IPS-1, Cardif and VISA) in order to trigger signalling cascades leading to IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation, two essential players involved in the establishment of a cellular antiviral state [7]\u2013[10].",

The TRAF family is composed of seven members, TRAF1 through TRAF7. They all share a C-terminal TRAF domain, which is composed of a coiled-coil domain followed by a conserved receptor-interacting domain. This domain mediates self-association and interaction with receptors or signalling proteins. Their N-terminal regions are composed of one or more zinc-finger motifs and, with the exception of TRAF1, a RING-finger domain that mediates E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and signalling [11]. All mammalian TRAFs localize to the cytoplasm except TRAF4, which is found in the nucleus. Importantly, gene deletion studies have identified TRAF3 as a critical mediator involved in the induction of the type I interferons (IFNs) by the RLH pathway [12], [13].",

TRAF3 acts as a negative regulator in this pathway by promoting the recruitment of the TRAF2-cIAP1-cIAP2 E3 ligase complex to NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) in order to control its rapid turnover in resting cells [18], [19]. However, in the RLH pathway, the adaptor protein TRAF3 acts as a positive regulator. Its interaction with MAVS and TRADD is important to trigger IRF-3 phosphorylation through the adaptor molecule TANK and the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKi [20], [21]. The TRADD-mediated recruitment of FADD and RIP1 to MAVS also enhances the interaction between TANK and TRAF3. A model was then proposed in which TRADD simultaneously organizes FADD- and RIP1-mediated NF-\u03baB signalling on one hand and TRAF3- and TANK-mediated IRF-3 signalling on the other [21], [22]. However, this possible mechanism of action requires further investigation to determine how TRAF3 is recruited to the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS upon viral infection.",

Both proteins were shown to play a primary role in the anterograde trafficking at the ER-Golgi interface by influencing the assembly and transport of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. Sec16A assembles on the ER membrane and forms organized scaffold defining ER exit sites (ERES) where COPII assembly occurs [23]\u2013[25]. The coiled-coil myosin-shaped molecule p115 was demonstrated to be an important tethering adaptor, which mediates vesicle tethering at the ER [26], Endoplasmatic Reticulum-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) [27], and in conjunction with tether proteins giantin and GM130 at the cis-Golgi [28], [29].",

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and confocal microscopy confirmed the association and co-localization of TRAF3 with p115 and Sec16A. Importantly, overexpression of p115 or Sec16A increased the type I IFN response, whereas their knockdown impaired the induction of antiviral genes.

HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-TRAF3 were harvested, subjected to IP with an anti-FLAG antibody under native conditions and FLAG-TRAF3 complexes were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In parallel, multiple AP/MS analyses were performed from cells expressing the FLAG alone. Following standard database searches, stringent statistical filtering was performed using SAINT (see Methods). Proteins detected with AvgP\u22650.7 were manually inspected for frequency of detection across a database of \u223c1000 AP/MS analyses, and proteins frequently detected in AP-MS experiments were removed. This resulted in the identification of 12 interaction partners for TRAF3, including TBK1, a well-known TRAF3 interactor [12], [13]. Surprisingly, Sec16A and p115, two proteins involved in ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking, were found to associate with TRAF3 immunocomplexes with a high confidence (Figure 1A and Figure S1).",

The interactions between FLAG-TRAF3 and Myc-p115 or EGFP-Sec16A were clearly detected (Figure 1B\u2013C). To further substantiate the interaction network between TRAF3, Sec16A and p115, we additionally established a pool of HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-p115 and analyzed its physiological interactors by FLAG affinity purification and LC-MS/MS, followed by analysis with SAINT. FLAG-p115 was found to be associated with nine proteins (after filtering), including Sec16A and GM130 (also known as GOLGA2), an established physical partner of p115 [34] (Figure 1D and Figure S1). The interaction of EGFP-Sec16A with Myc-p115 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 1E). However, endogenous TRAF3 was not recovered in our FLAG-p115 analysis. This result may be explained by the fact that p115 has many higher-abundance interactors and/or is part of alternative complexes independent from TRAF3. However, overexpressed Myc-TRAF3 was recovered from FLAG-p115 complexes when the latter were immunoprecipitated from 293T cells co-expressing both constructs (Figure 1F). The TRAF3 interactome network identified by functional proteomics (Figure S1B) suggests the presence of at least a fraction of TRAF3 in close proximity to the Golgi network.",

The vesicle-tethering protein p115 is known to colocalize and interact specifically with the NH2 terminus of the cis-Golgi protein GM130 ([36] and see Figure 2A, panel 2). Upon ectopic expression of Myc-p115 and FLAG-TRAF3, we observed a co-localization of these two proteins (Figure 2A, panel 1). FLAG-TRAF3 was also observed to localize to the Golgi apparatus where it exhibits a high degree of overlap with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (Figure 2A, panel 3). p115 was previously reported to be present in the ERGIC, through an interaction involving activated Rab1 [37], [38]. This cellular localization of FLAG-p115 can be visualized with the conventional ERGIC marker, ERGIC53 (Figure 2A panel 4). Notably, FLAG-TRAF3 (or Myc-TRAF3 (unpublished data)) was also present in the ERGIC (Figure 2A, panel 5). No significant colocalization was detected between TRAF3 and the ER marker calnexin (Figure 2A, panel 6), the lysosomal compartments (Figure 2A, panel 7) and the mitochondrial network (Figure 2A, panel 8).",

The two proteins clearly colocalized at the perinuclear region (Figure 2B, panel 2). FLAG-TRAF3 and EGFP-Sec16A also mainly colocalized at the perinuclear region in HeLa cells (Figure 2B, panel 3). Moreover, a colocalization of FLAG-TRAF3 with endogenous Sec16A at ERES distributed in the cytoplasm could be observed. However, some FLAG-TRAF3 punctae also appeared in close proximity to those containing Sec16A (Figure 2B, panel 4, compare arrows). Ectopic expression of FLAG-TRAF2 and FLAG-TRAF6 revealed that only TRAF3 exhibits a cellular Golgi-like distribution (Figure S2A) and colocalizes with endogenous Sec16A (Figure S2B) or Myc-p115 (Figure S2C).

Nevertheless, FLAG-TRAF3 was detected to colocalize with GM130 and Myc-p115 in cells treated with nocodazole (Figure S3, panels 1, 2 and 3). Treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), leads to relocalization of the components of the cis-Golgi matrix to cytoplasmic punctate structures (also called remnants) that appear close to ERES [41], [42]. GM130 and p115 are cis-Golgi proteins, which are known to be relocalized to these remnants [41]. FLAG-TRAF3 was also relocated to cytoplasmic remnants upon BFA treatment, where it co-localized with GM130 and Myc-p115 (Figure S3, panels 4 and 5). Altogether, results from our pharmacological experiments and confocal microscopy strongly suggest that TRAF3 localized to ER-to-Golgi transport compartments, where it tightly associates [43], [44].",

            "text": "It has been proposed that a structurally intact TRAF3 molecule is required for its biological function. Indeed, TRAF3 lacking its N-terminal RING or the C-terminal TRAF domain lacks antiviral activity [20]. We therefore examined the subcellular localization of TRAF3 deletion mutants in reconstituted TRAF3 knockout MEF cells. Removal of the N-terminal Ring Finger domain (Figure 3A, panel 1), the N-terminal Ring and Zinc finger domains (Figure 3A, panel 2) or the C-terminal TRAF domain (Figure 3A, panel 3) resulted in TRAF3 molecules that no longer colocalize with the Golgi marker GM130. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells revealed that immunocomplexes containing p115 are detected only with full length TRAF3 and that Sec16A-containing immunocomplexes required at least the isoleucine zipper and the TRAF domain (Figure 3B). Moreover, TRAF3 is known to interact with several substrates containing a particular motif (PxQxS/T) called the TRAF interaction motif (TIM) [45]. The mutation of two amino acids located in the TIM-binding pocket of TRAF3, Y440 and Q442, abrogates these interactions [20]. Interestingly, a strong interaction was detected between FLAG-TRAF3 Y440/Q442A and Myc-p115 or EGFP-Sec16A (Figures 3C and 3D), implying that this interaction is independent of the TIM motif. Thus, it is not clear yet whether TRAF3 interacts directly with Sec16A or p115 or requires other components such as TFG ([46] and see Figure S1). Collectively, these data suggest that an intact TRAF3 molecule is required for its proper localization and interaction with components of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular pathway.",

Therefore, we next addressed the subcellular localization of endogenous TRAF3 upon viral infection and RNA/DNA sensor pathway activation. Intracellular delivery of the double-stranded RNA mimicry molecule, poly I:C, or the dsDNA mimicry agent poly dA:dT resulted in disorganization of the ribbon-like structure of the Golgi apparatus, giving rise to the formation of Golgi ministacks containing GM130 (Figure 4A, arrows in panel 2 and 3).

Confocal microscopy experiments revealed that addition of dilysine and dihydrophobic residues to the C-terminal end of TRAF3 resulted in the formation of large TRAF3 aggregates which failed to colocalize with the Golgi marker GM130 upon infection with SeV (Figure 7A). Consequently, the ability of the TRAF3-AKKFF mutant to mediate TRAF3-dependent synergistic activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter was drastically reduced (Figure 7B), which is likely due to less binding to MAVS (Figure S5).",

To investigate whether Sec16A or p115 play a role in the type I IFN response, we overexpressed both proteins in Hec1B cells and assessed NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 transcription factor activation using reporter gene assays. Without any stimulation, overexpression of either protein did not significantly activate the IFN\u03b2 promoter. However, following viral infection, the response was increased in cells overexpressing Sec16A or p115 (Figure 8A). Overexpression of Sec16A and p115 also increased the activation of the ISG56 promoter (IRF3-dependent promoter) (Figure 8B) and the NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter (Figure 8C) following SeV infection. Moreover, we observed a synergistic effect on IFN\u03b2 promoter activity when Sec16A or p115 were co-expressed with MAVS (Figure 8D), TBK1 (Figure 8E) and, interestingly, the TLR3 essential effector TRIF (Figure 8F). Similar results were also obtained for the ISG56 promoter and the NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter (Figure S6). To further substantiate that the positive transcriptional effect of Sec16A and p115 is dependent on TRAF3, TRAF3-knockout MEF cells were transfected with p115 and Sec16A in the presence or absence of TRAF3 and used in the IFN\u03b2 promoter reporter assay. As suspected, the enhanced promoter activation, induced by ectopically expressed p115 and Sec16A, was entirely dependent on the presence of TRAF3 (Figure 8G). Thus, when expressed in relatively low amounts in Hec1B and MEF cells (not shown), p115 and Sec16A positively participate in a TRAF3-dependent type I IFN response, probably reflecting the ability of a subpopulation of cytoplasmic TRAF3 to further associate with the ER-to-Golgi components under these conditions of mild ectopic expression.",

Thus, when ectopically expressed in high amounts in 293T cells, p115 and Sec16A were expected to blunt TRAF3-dependent transcriptional activation. Indeed, transfection of increasing amounts of p115 or Sec16A efficiently blunted TRIF-, RIG-I-, and MAVS-induced IFN\u03b2 promoter activation (Figure S7A\u2013C) as well as NF-\u03baB promoter activation (data not shown). Importantly, adding increasing amounts of TRAF3 in this specific reporter gene assay dose-dependently reversed the inhibitory effect of p115 and Sec16A, once more substantiating the relationship that exist between Sec16A, p115 and TRAF3 (Figure S7D). Moreover, transfection of these plasmids also blunted TBK1-induced ISRE promoter activation (Figure S7E), but did not affect the transactivation response induced by the use of a constitutively active form of IRF-3 (IRF3-5D) (Figure S7F), suggesting that the ER-to-Golgi compartment plays upstream of IRF-3 in type I IFN signalling.",

To verify whether this approach affected IRF-3 activation and the induction of an IRF-3-dependent antiviral protein [53], we next verified the phosphorylation state of IRF-3 and the induction of ISG54 in HeLa cells expressing either shRNA duplexes targeting p115 and Sec16A or cells expressing a non-targeting (NT) shRNA duplex. The phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the expression of ISG54 were readily observed upon SeV infection, poly I:C and poly dA:dT transfection in HeLa cells expressing the NT shRNA duplex but was clearly reduced in cells expressing different shRNA duplexes targeting p115 (Figure 10A) and Sec16A (Figure 10B).

However, how TRAF3 assembles into functional signalling complexes is still not fully understood. In general, TRAF3 is thought to reside in the cytosol and translocate to surface membrane receptors upon engagement of CD40 or other TNFR family members [54]. Akin to its role in MyD88-dependent cytokine production and TRIF-dependent type I IFN production [55], TRAF3 conceivably also has the capacity to associate with endosomal compartments enriched in TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 receptors [56]. Additionally, upon RLH activation TRAF3 interacts with MAVS and TRADD to trigger IRF-3 phosphorylation through the adaptor molecule TANK and the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKi [20], [21]. However, how TRAF3 associates with MAVS upon RLH activation remains unanswered.",

            "text": "Herein, we report that TRAF3 localizes to the ER-to-Golgi compartments through its ability to interact with p115- and Sec16A-containing complexes. A pharmacological approach using the microtubule depolarizing agent nocodazole led to the redistribution of TRAF3 into small punctate cytoplasmic structures discrete from the ER along with both Golgi matrix proteins p115 and GM130. Both the structure and positioning of the Golgi apparatus have been shown to be highly dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton [57]. Interestingly, a link between TRAF3 and the microtubule network has been already established in a previous study through its interaction with Microtubule-Interacting Protein that associates with TRAF3 (MIP-T3) [58]. TRAF3 was dissociated from this complex upon CD40L stimulation and, consequently, it was suggested that microtubule association of TRAF3 could be responsible for directing TRAF3 to defined membrane microdomains in the cell. A similar scenario is proposed here where, in response to viral infection, the association of TRAF3 with complexes containing p115 and Sec16A at the ER-to-Golgi vesicular pathway may play an important role in positioning TRAF3 with MAVS (see Figure 11). Indeed, the following findings suggests a role for Sec16A and p115 in the TRAF3-mediated RLH type I IFN response: (1) Sec16A and p115 are found in immunocomplexes containing TRAF3, but not TRAF2 or TRAF6; (2) inactivation of TRAF3 by deletion of its N-terminal RING finger domain and the C-terminal TRAF domain displaces TRAF3 from the ER-Golgi transport compartments; (3) in non-treated cells, TRAF3 colocalizes and tightly associates with p115, Sec16A, ERGIC53 and GM130, markers of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular compartment; (4) activation of the RLH pathway leads to reorganization of the Golgi apparatus into punctate structures containing TRAF3 and GM130; (5) an increased association between TRAF3, Sec16A, p115 and TBK1 is observed in virally-infected, dsRNA- and dsDNA-transfected cells; (6) mild overexpression of both proteins enhances SeV-, TBK1- and MAVS-stimulated IFN\u03b2, ISG56 and NF-\u03baB promoter induction; (7) knocking down the expression level of p115 or Sec16A affects the cellular distribution of TRAF3, impairs its capacity to associate with MAVS and diminishes the type I IFN response following poly I:C or polydA:dT transfection and SeV infection; and (8) enforced retention of TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi compartment by the addition of a COPI and COP II sorting signal peptide impairs TRAF3 recruitment to the cis-Golgi and diminishes the type I IFN response. Thus, we propose that these two trafficking proteins, Sec16A and p115, form a complex with TRAF3 at ER-to-Golgi transport compartments in order to ensure its proper recruitment to the mitochondrial network during a viral infection. Interestingly, enforced expression of Sec16A or p115 also increases TRIF-mediated IFN\u03b2 promoter activation, reinforcing the role for the ER-to-Golgi vesicular compartment in TLR3 and TLR4 signalling, as recently reviewed [59].",

It is likely that the use of dsDNA (polydA:dT) used in our study might activate both the RNA-dependent pathway (through RNA polymerase III [63]) and the recently described DNA-dependent pathway (through IFI16 [2]), allowing TRAF3-loaded punctae to interact with both MAVS and STING respectively for proper innate immune signalling (Figure 11).

            "text": "It is noteworthy that, as a common feature, plus-stranded RNA viruses have the ability to induce cytoplasmic membrane rearrangements that facilitate their replication. Consequently, the formation of these RNA replication complexes results in dramatic reorganization of the secretory pathway of host cells [64]. For example, poliovirus-infected cells accumulate membranous vesicles derived from COPII vesicles [65] whereas Kunjin virus induces \u201cconvoluted membranes\u201d that contain markers from the ERGIC [66]. The precise role for this internal membrane rearrangement in the virus propagation and virus-host interaction requires further investigation. Nevertheless, localization of TRAF3 and TRADD to these vesicular transport compartments could represent a cellular strategy to increase the rate of RNA detection and the formation of an effective signalling complex at the mitochondrial membrane. The observation that TRADD translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria during Influenza A virus infection supports this model [67]. Additionally, recent observations highlight the fact that viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms involving the Golgi apparatus to specifically block TRAF3 recruitment into a functional signalling complex. Notably, the SARS Coronavirus M protein, a Golgi localized protein, was recently found to impede the formation of a TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKKi complex at the Golgi apparatus [68]. The NY-1 strain Hantavirus glycoprotein (Gn) was also shown to disrupt TRAF3-TBK1 interaction by interacting with TRAF3 through its cytoplasmic tail [69].",

            "text": "The notion of cellular proximity to favor exchanges and signalling events between organelles has been an intense field of interest for many years. Recently, mitofusin 2 present on the ER was shown to tether the ER to mitochondria in order to promote efficient Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation purposes. Interestingly, mitofusin 2 was also shown to inhibit RLH pathway signalling by interacting with the C-terminal of MAVS [70]. Furthermore, the Golgi localization of the glycolipid GD3 is important for its transport to the mitochondria after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation [71], [72]. Membrane scrambling between Golgi and mitochondria following Fas stimulation is another example pointing to the connection between different cellular organelles [73]. Moreover, signalling at the Golgi apparatus and endosomes has been observed for different types of membrane-bound receptors [56], [74] and protein kinase cascades [75].",

Detergent concentration in the lysis buffer was 0.5% NP-40; the lysis buffer was added at 4 ml/g wet cell pellet, and cells were subjected to passive lysis (30 minutes) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle and centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was performed on the cleared lysate by adding 25 \u00b5l packed FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) and incubating for two hours. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and three times in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were eluted with ammonium hydroxide, lyophilized in a speed-vac, resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8\u20138.3), and incubated at 37\u00b0C with trypsin overnight. The ammonium bicarbonate was evaporated, and the samples were resuspended in HPLC buffer A2 (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), then directly loaded onto capillary columns packed in-house with Magic 5 \u00b5m, 100A, C18AQ. MS/MS data was acquired in data-dependent mode (over a 2 hr acetonitrile 2\u201340% gradient) on a ThermoFinnigan LTQ equipped with a Proxeon NanoSource and an Agilent 1100 capillary pump. Acquired RAW files were converted to mgf format using ProteoWizard. The searched database was human RefSeq (version 45). *.mgf files were searched with the Mascot search engine (version 2.3) using the following variable parameters: semi trypsin digestion, one missed cleavage allowed, asparagine deamidation and methionine oxidation. The fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da (monoisotopic mass), and the mass window for the precursor was +/\u22123 Da (only +2 and +3 charge ions were processed). Mascot results were parsed for further analysis into a LIMS system developed at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute [81]. Scoring of specific interactors for FLAG-TRAF3 and FLAG-p115 was performed using the statistical tool SAINT (Significance Analysis of INTeracome). SAINT converts label free quantification, such as spectral counts, for each prey protein identified in a purification of a bait into the probability of true interaction between the two proteins [82], [83]. SAINT can calculate a probability of interaction even for proteins proteins frequently detected in AP-MS experiments, providing that a quantitative enrichment is detected in the purification of the sample [84]. For each bait, two biological replicates were used. Twelve negative control runs (consisting of cells expressing the FLAG tag alone) were processed in parallel and combined into 5 virtual controls for SAINT modeling. SAINT calculates scores differently depending on the availability of negative control purifications, and thus the implementation for spectral count data incorporating control purification data was used (details are described in [82]). The probability score was first computed for each prey in independent biological replicates separately (iProb). Then the final probability score for a pair of bait and prey proteins was calculated by taking the average of the probabilities in individual replicates (AvgP); final results with AvgP\u22650.5 were further inspected. A manual cross-reference against a database containing >1000 independent FLAG AP-MS runs was finally performed to identify potential proteins frequently detected in AP-MS experiments and were removed from the final dataset.",
