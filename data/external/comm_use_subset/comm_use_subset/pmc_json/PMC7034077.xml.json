HCoV-NL63 primarily infects upper respiratory tract and most of HCoV-NL63 infections are acquired during childhood. Neutralizing activity directed against HCoV-NL63 is common in sera from adults and rarely in infant\u2019s serum [12]. During 2009 and 2016, HCoV-NL63 accounted for about 0.5% (60/11399) of all acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized pediatric patients in Guangzhou, China [13], most of these cases associated with HCoV-NL63 were considered to be evidence of endemic infection and no outbreaks were reported.",

A unique mutation (I507 L) in receptor-binding domain (RBD) was detected in the new subgenotype of HCoV-NL63 associated with increased viral entry into host cells indicating that HCoV-NL63 was undergoing continuous mutation which potentially could enhance HCoV-NL63 virulence and promote transmission. This study showed that HCoV-NL63 had the potential to cause epidemics in humans and it may be a more important human pathogen than is commonly believed. Efforts should be paid to monitor genetic changes in HCoV-NL63 genome and also its pathogenicity and prevalence in the human population [14].",

However, in 2018 there was a sharp increase of HCov-NL-63 infection. Twenty-three cases were detected in 2018, 20 of which were detected from July to September 2018 (Figure 1A and B). The clinical information of the HCoV-NL63 infected patients was summarized in Figure 1(C). The majority of patients who were infected with HCoV-NL63 had pneumonia, and two patients had severe pneumonia. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 5 years old. Clinical manifestation of these patients included cough, fever, coryza, shortness of breath, wheezing and abnormal pulmonary breath sound. Samples from HCoV-NL63 positive patients were also tested for other 14 common respiratory pathogens. Of the 23 patients, 19 (82.6%) of them were infected only with HCoV-NL63, while 4 (17.4%) patients were found to be co-infected with other pathogens, such as RSV, HBoV and EV. These data clearly showed that most of the patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were caused by HCoV-NL63 but not co-infected with other pathogens. HCoV-NL63 infection presented here preferentially caused severe lower respiratory tract infection rather than upper respiratory tract infection. No evidence of injuries, COPD, immune diseases, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders et al were detected in these patients. Comparison of clinical characteristics including age, co-infection and clinical symptoms showed no obvious differences between different subgenotypes infections (Table S1). Considering the increasing case number and the proportion of HCoV-NL63 single infection, this should be a small-scale outbreak associated with HCoV-NL63 in Guangzhou, China, in 2018 indicating HCoV-NL63 is a more important human pathogen than is commonly believed.\n",

Clean data was used for assembling or mapping against the reference sequence (NC_005831.2) of HCoV-NL63 (Figure 2A). Using both next-generation and Sanger sequencing technology, five complete genomes and nine partial spike protein sequences of HCoV-NL63 were obtained and analysed in this study (Figure 2B). Other HCoV-NL63 sequences were not obtained because of low viral load in respiratory specimens. To investigate genetic relationship between HCoV-NL63 strains detected in this study and other HCoV-NL63 strains available in GenBank, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on partial spike gene sequences. All available HCoV-NL63 strains were collected and divided into three genotypes (genotypes A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analyses of partial S genes (Figure 3). Genotype A was further divided into subtypes A1, A2 and A3. Genotype C contained three subgenotypes C1, C2 and C3. We also performed phylogenetic analyses based on complete genome, orf1ab and spike genes, respectively (Figure 4). Phylogenetic trees based on orf1ab, spike genes and complete genome showed similar topologies with seven sub-genotypes, which further confirmed the phylogenetic structure and supported a new subgenotype C3 circulating in Guangzhou, China (Figure 4). There were two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63 circulating in South China, Guangzhou, which associated with increasing numbers of severe respiratory illness in 2018. Significantly, the ChinaGD02, ChinaGD03, ChinaGD05, ChinaGD10 strains presented in this study shared a common origin and formed a new subgenotype C3 on the same branch with other HCoV-NL63 subgenotypes. Meanwhile the old genotype B was also circulating in China which was identified previously from American clinical specimen [23]. In summary, the discovery of the new subgenotype C3 emphasized the risk of an epidemic caused by a mutated HCoV-NL63.\n\n\n",

The subgenotype-specific SAP in spike protein further confirmed the rationality of the new subgenotypic classification (subgenotype A1, A2, A3, B, C1, C2, and C3).

Of note, one signature amino acid mutation at 507 L of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected in all strains of subgenotype C3 which segregated from other different subgenotypes. In addition, amino acid alignment analysis of HCoV-NL63 partial spike protein indicated that most of the HCoV-NL63 detected here had the special mutation I507 L which belongs to subgenotype C3 (Figure S3).

As showed in Figure 7(A and B), in both lentiviral and VSV system mutant pseudotyped (507 L) showed increased viral entry into susceptible cells compared to WT. The higher viral entry may be associated with increased transmission and case number in human in South China. Sequences alignment between subgenotype C3 and B indicated only one SNP (E471D) was located in RBD region. To directly compare viral entry between subgenotypes B and C3, pseudotype bearing E471D mutation was prepared. No difference was observed between E471D mutant and WT in Figure 7(C and D). The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 RBD complexed with its receptor ACE2 has been published previously [24] and three key RBMs (receptor binding motifs) were defined as RBM1 (residues 493\u2013513), RBM2 (residues 531\u2013541) and RBM3 (residues 585\u2013590).

Most of these patients showed symptoms of pneumonia or severe pneumonia. This represented a significant increase in case numbers of HCoV-NL63 infection as compared to last 10 years in the corresponding period of time indicating a small-scale outbreak of severe respiratory illness caused by HCoV-NL63. In addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyses demonstrated that two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63 were associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease and a new subgenotype was first discovered and showed different evolutionary trends. Previous reports showed that HCoV-NL63 infections in China are distributed across the whole year without an obvious seasonal distribution or presence of clusters in China [30,31]. The epidemic characteristics benefited viral continuous transmission and fast evolution.",

The new subgenotype circulating in Guangzhou primarily caused LRTI in hospitalized children and showed the sign of fast transmission. Based on previous reports, HCoV-NL63 was mainly divided into three genotypes, including A, B and C. However, as the continuous identification of HCoV-NL63 related sequences, the genotyping classification cannot meet the requirement for sequence analysis, especially for discovery of new subgenotype. Here, we divided all the HCoV-NL63 available into seven subgenotypes (subgenotypes A1, A2, A3, B, C1, C2 and C3). The subgenotype-specific SAP analysis of spike protein also supported this classification. Comparison of clinical characteristics between subgenotype C3 and B infected patients showed no significant difference. More genotype-specific cases were required to explore the relationship between clinical symptoms and genotype or co-infection.",

Due to various reasons (geographical restriction, inefficient human to human transmission route, etc.) their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a global pandemic is limited [32,33]. HCoV-NL63 has been prevalent worldwide for about 1000 years [14], although most of the infections associated with HCoV-NL63 are mild. As the continuous transmission and evolution, the change of pathogenicity is inevitable. Here, the new subgenotype of HCoV-NL63 causing LRI appeared to be far more infectious due to the unique mutation I507L in RBD. Considering HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV share the same cellular receptor, a better understanding of pathogenicity and epidemiology of newHCoV-NL63 subgenotype is of particular importance in view of potential enhanced virulence or transmission. Epidemiological and phylogenetic studies are required periodically to evaluate the risk of an epidemic caused by newHCoV-NL63.",
