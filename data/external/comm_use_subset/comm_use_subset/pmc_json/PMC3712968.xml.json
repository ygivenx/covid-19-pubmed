Infections account for substantial morbidity and mortality and fever is often the only indication of infection in this patient group. [1] Empirically, prompt administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials has been one of the important contributions to increased event free survival and overall survival among these patients. [2] Today, bacteraemia is identified in 23%\u201333% [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] of all patients, and studies of the viral contribution to the aetiological panorama are still limited but estimated to be 30% [8]. This leaves, approximately a third of febrile episodes unexplained despite extensive microbiological investigations and these are thus termed fever of unknown origin (FUO). [9], [10].",

This, process disrupts the balance between the normal bowel bacterial flora and host immune system, creating a milieu where microbial products could translocate into systemic circulation. Endotoxins, more specifically, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are found commonly on the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria. Their presence in the peripheral circulatory system could thus signify potential bacterial invasion, requiring rapid host response. Potent pyrogens, endotoxins activate the inflammatory host defence via binding to soluble SC14 (sCD14) which, in turn initiates downstream cytokines important for the clearance of bacterial infections. Elevated endotoxins had been reported in studies with immunocompromised cohorts, for example, HIV-1 [11] and patients with haematological malignancies and is used as a measure of microbial translocation.

Patients that developed fever (auricular temperature >38.0\u00b0C twice within an hour or \u226538.5\u00b0C at one occasion) were sampled within 72 hours from fever onset, whereas patients without fever were sampled upon routine medical appointments during the neutropenia episode. Whole blood was collected in EDTA-tubes and plasma was prepared by centrifugation before storage at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Additional blood and nasal pharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected for microbiological testing. Medical records were retrospectively acquired for all included patients.

We further observed a correlation between the use of prophylactic antibiotics and increased plasma endotoxin concentrations. Previous studies attempting to determine relation of microbial translocation to febrile episodes in a similar patient cohort had presented mixed results. This stem primarily from differences in endotoxin detection methods [13], [15], degree of immunosuppression in patients [12] and small sample sizes. It should also be noted that these studies limited their work to only systemic concentrations of endotoxins [12], [13], [14] or positive faecal bacterial cultures as indicators of microbial translocation. [15] In only one of these studies were pro-inflammatory cytokines measured as well [12]. However, the patients were less immunosuppressed compared to the current study, leading to difficulties for adequate comparison. To this end, effort had been placed to amass a larger study cohort with strict adherence to the inclusion criteria and, endotoxin concentrations measured with established and commonly used commercial assays. Adding to the field, we have, in our study, in addition to measuring plasma endotoxin concentrations, also measured the host receptor for LPS, sCD14 in an attempt to determine the contribution of microbial translocation to fever as a clinical outcome.",

While one might expect that presence of bacteria findings in blood should correlate with elevated endotoxin concentrations, it is pertinent to bear in mind that the detection target of the endotoxin assay is the immunoreactive lipid A portion of LPS. [25] The lower endotoxin concentrations observed in episodes with bacterial findings, as well as the similarities in endotoxin concentrations between episodes with bacterial and viral findings, could reflect a situation of availability. An anchor of the LPS molecule to the bacterial outer membrane, exposure occurs only if they are shed or, upon disruption of the bacterial cell wall. Thus, in line with previous studies [26], it should not be surprising that bacteria findings do not necessarily correlate with increase in measurable endotoxins. The lack of accuracy and precision undoubtedly limits the use of the LAL assay in routine clinical practice but it has been the most widely used standardised method for the measure of endotoxin concentration in recent years. The tendency of hydrophobic regions of lipid A to aggregate or binding to the LPS binding protein, could also potentially limit detection.",

[29] With the elevated endotoxins observed in this cohort, our findings contend that sCD14 could be acting in an inhibitory way to limit excessive bystander damage from prolonged systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, despite higher endotoxin concentrations in the FUO group, there is no corresponding increase in sCD14. The inherent immunosuppressed state of this cohort could also be implicated in the saturation of sCD14 response observed. Monocytes and to a lesser extent, neutrophils have been suggested to be the main sources of sCD14, either by shedding of mCD14 or secreted directly. Antineoplastic treatment for the underlying disease leaves these patients with reduced monocytes and neutrophils hence a limit on sCD14 production is not entirely surprising. A dampened sCD14 secretion could also explain the lack of correlation between endotoxin and sCD14 concentration in this study. Overall, our findings show evidence of microbial translocation, particularly in the FUO episodes through elevated endotoxin and sCD14 concentrations.",

Broad spectrum PCR targeting conserved bacterial genes like the 16 s rDNA could improve bacterial diagnostics once the inherent difficulties with cross-contamination and false positivity have been resolved. [32] Regardless, PCR diagnostics is a viable option to circumvent this limitation and should be considered for future studies. In this study, we have chosen to follow conventional clinical bacteriological routines in order to obtain the current clinical picture. Given the transient nature of circulating endotoxins and sCD14, care had been taken to ensure samples were obtained within a 72 hr window within which, no sampling bias was observed. Additional information with regards to mucositis grading was unfortunately unavailable in this study and should be considered for inclusion in future studies as a measure of mucosal damage. Further, it would have been desirable to perform longitudinal studies in order to determine if there were correlations between endotoxin concentrations and progression to severe infection or, even septic conditions. Unfortunately, this was not possible with the current study but should be considered in other studies with the same patient cohort. In this cross-sectional study, our findings suggest that in the absence of microbiological findings, microbial translocation could contribute to febrile episodes in an adult neutropaenic cohort. This not only adds to the repertoire of potential causes of fever, it also indicates the urgency for suitable biomarkers to distinguish between drug and tumour related fevers (DTRF) and fevers of infectious causes.
