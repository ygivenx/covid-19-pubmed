One of the descending lineages from that node corresponds to the infector (say A), and the other to the infectee (say B). The length of the branch is either (1) the time between A\u2019s infection and A infecting B (if B is the first case A infected), or (2) the time between A\u2019s infecting the individual she infected just prior to B and the time A infects B. The pendant branch length to the tip labelled B is the time between either (1) B\u2019s infection and B\u2019s sampling (if B did not infect anyone) or (2) the time between B\u2019s last infection of someone else and B\u2019s sampling. In this way, the branching process defines a rooted, timed, bifurcating tree. While the focus of this paper is on how the shapes of these trees are affected by the intensity function describing when infection events occur, the motivation of the work makes the implicit assumption that these shapes are made relevant because under good conditions, timed phylogenetic trees are a reasonable approximation to these bifurcating timed transmission trees.",

Gillespie-type methods do not fit the problem naturally, and steps must be taken to ensure that all events that can happen before the final simulation time have the appropriate probability of happening (affecting the conditions under which the process can be stopped). This can be very computationally time-consuming due to the variability of the tree size in branching processes. This complexity is part of the motivation for using simple intensity functions. To simulate non homogeneous trees, we wrote an iterative function that takes in input the ancestor, the start and final time of the tree, the intensity function and the life-span distribution: SimNHTree(ancestor, startTime, finalTime, int, lambda). The branching property states that the subtree generated by each daughter of the ancestor is equal, in distribution, to the whole tree in every aspect but the starting time. To use this property we first find the number of daughters of the ancestor and their birth times, simulating a non homogeneous Poisson process with intensity int. Then, for each of the ancestor\u2019s daughters, the function SimNHTree calls itself with the daughter and its birth time as new input: SimNHTree(daughteri, birthTime(daughteri), finalTime, int, lambda). This generates the ancestor\u2019s daughters subtrees which can be merged because we track each subtree\u2019s ancestor and start time.",

In Scenario 2 we tune the time to obtain, on average, trees with the desired number of tips. To do this, we use a simple algorithm that simulates a group of trees and if the total average of the tips is too high/low then the algorithm decreases/increases the final time and starts a new simulation. It stops once the average number of tips of each group is between 32 and 34 (to be comparable to our dataset) or between 98 and 102, in order to compare results in larger trees (Scenario 2-large). To exclude meaningless cases, we rejected trees with fewer than 5 tips. In each scenario, we vary the delay between becoming infected and infecting others, using different intensity functions (each labelled with a case number illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2(a)). In Scenario 3 we increase both the delay between becoming infected and infecting others (ie location of the intensity function) and the height of the intensity function. This results in the basic reproduction number ranging more widely than in Scenarios 1 and 2. Here we also use a positive death rate, so trees are not ultrametric.",

However, R0 values for most common pathogens including tuberculosis (R0 = 1\u20131.5) are in the range 1\u20136, with some viruses having much higher values (measles for example at R0 \u2248 20). Our choices of R0 mirror these values. The sizes of our outbreaks mirror the dataset we have, and in order that the results not be restricted to processes of this small size we also explore larger trees. Table 1 and Figs 1 and 2(a) give details of the parameters in each simulation. We compare these sets of simulations with two sets of constant-rate birth-death trees, one with with parameters matching the R0 of the trees in Scenario 1, and one with parameters estimated from our TB data using BEAST. For each case in Scenario 1, 2 and 3 we simulate 200 trees and for the two homogeneous cases we simulate 1000 trees.",

In the terminology of branching processes this distribution is called the offspring distribution; the constant-rate birth-death process has a geometric offspring distribution (a convolution of a Poisson number during their lifespan and an exponential lifespan). However our non-homogeneous Poisson processes, in which cases survive their infectious period, have a Poisson offspring distribution. To explore possible effects of this difference, we simulate a variant of our process in which the intensity functions varied as in Scenario 1, but we draw the numbers of secondary infections from a geometric distribution (see Supplement).",

In particular, as the start of the infectious period n moves further from the time of infection, the tree imbalance increases. A negative or null slope of both standardised Colless and Sackin imbalance is rejected with a p-value p < 10\u22128 for both cases 1\u20134 and cases 5\u20138. The frequency of cherries is unaffected by memory if the R0 is kept constant (p = 0.48). For cases 5\u20138 the frequency of cherries is decreasing, having rejected the hypothesis of a null or negative slope (p < 10\u221215). The frequency of pitchforks shows a slight increase for cases 1\u20134 in (p = 1.3 \u22c5 10\u22126) and decrease for cases 5\u20138 (p = 1.5 \u22c5 10\u22124). Similarly the \u201cstairs 2\u201d feature55 increases as n increases for cases 1\u20134 where the R0 is kept constant (p = 1.4 \u22c5 10\u22124) and decreases for cases 5\u20138 where the Malthusian parameter is constant (p < 10\u221215). The normalised number of internal nodes with a single tip descendant (\u201cILnumber\u201d), maximum heights and average ladder length increase when both the R0 is constant (p 1.9 \u22c5 10\u22125, <10\u221215, 9.9 \u22c5 10\u22129 respectively) and when the Matlhusian parameter is constant (all p <10\u221215). Whereas it is difficult to visualise most topological differences, the increase in imbalance, standardised maximum height and average ladder can be appreciated from the example trees related to Scenario 1 in Fig. 5. for instance the tree in (S1 case5) is more balance and has smaller ladders, in proportion to its tips, than (S1 case7) or (S1 case8).",

            "text": "However, the most dramatic difference between the various cases in Fig. 4 is in the number of tips. This was against expectation because the combinations final time-R0 and final time-M were kept the same in cases 1\u20134 and 5\u20138 respectively (see Table 1). Particularly in cases 5\u20138 which have the same Malthusian parameter, the net growth is the same up to a (usually unknown) constant, and here it seems that this constant is highly dependent on the specific intensity function. This led us to ask whether the impact of memory on tree shapes in this context is just a matter of the impact of memory on the number of tips. To explore this question, we adjusted the time periods of the simulations to allow the different cases to produce branching trees of comparable sizes (Scenario 2). Fig. 6 shows the result. We now see lower differences between the processes. In the simulations where R0 is kept constant, only the frequency of cherries, the \u201cstairs 2\u201d and the ILnumber show a statistically significant (p < 0.01) pattern. The cherry frequency and the \u201cstairs 2\u201d decrease (p of 0.2 \u22c5 10\u22123 and 0.6 \u22c5 10\u22123 respectively), whether the ILnumber increases as n increases (p = 0.3 \u22c5 10\u22122). In the cases with constant M, more shape features showed statistically significant patterns. As the time between infection and the start of the infectious period grows, the cherry and pitchfork frequencies together with the \u201cstairs 2\u201d measure decrease (p of 10\u221215, 0.5 \u22c5 10\u22123, <10\u221215 respectively), whether the ILnumber, the maximum height and the average ladder increase (p of <10\u221215, 0.3 \u22c5 10\u22122 and 0.1 \u22c5 10\u22123 respectively). Comparing to Scenario 1, adjusting for the size of the branching trees eradicates the some effects of memory, particularly in the simulations where R0 is kept constant. In Fig. 5, second row, some example trees for Scenario 2 were chosen. The shape difference between each other is not as evident as the trees from Scenario 1; there is a clear increase in the proportion of internal nodes with a one tip descendant (standardised ILnumber) from case 5 (11 nodes, 23 tips), to case 8 (14 nodes, 24 tips).",

Data-derived trees had slightly lower imbalance and slightly lower normalised maximum height than the simulated trees once size was controlled (Fig. 6); the two inference methods differed more with each other in several shape parameters (cherries, IL number and stairs) than the data trees differed from the simulations. Comparing to Scenario 1, the variability in the data-derived trees was typically much lower than that in the constant-rate models and more closely matched the tightly defined simulations in cases 3, 4, 7, and 8, but then the number of tips in the data is fixed, and the numbers of tips in cases 3, 4, 7 and 8 were the most narrowly distributed as well.

Since the trees are ultrametric, the estimate of the birth rate should be equal to the Malthusian parameter. With reference to Fig. 8, the median estimate (shown by the horizontal bar in the boxplots) is too high in cases 1\u20134, correct in cases 5\u20138 in Scenario 1, but too high in cases 5 and 8 in Scenario 2. We also used Pybus\u2019 \u03b364 to analyse the timing of branching events; this is possible for the ultrametric trees (Scenarios 1 and 2). We found that both memory, as we have explored it, and the distribution of the number of secondary infections, can affect whether trees appear consistent with the Yule model (see Supplementary Material).",

The marked difference in shape is also evident in the examples in Fig. 5. Imbalance is increasing with R0, with p 8,06 \u22c5 10\u221210 and 4.1 \u22c5 10\u22123 for Colless and Sackin respectively, as well as the maximum height (p = 2.0 \u22c5 10\u22129). The number of tips and average ladder length are the only two shape features with no statistically significant difference among the three cases (p 0.87 and 0.06 respectively). A long delay between infection and start of infectious period causes the tree have only a few individuals with numerous offspring as in (S3 case2) and (S3 case3), compared to a more \u201cnormal\u201d shape of (S3 case1). The extreme case (S3 case3) is composed by a handful of long caterpillars which imply low frequency of cherries and pitchforks and a high ILnumber, validating the results in Fig. 2.",

We found that the correlations are remarkably preserved across the simulations, but that Case 8 and the latter 2 cases from Scenario 3 (all with high R0 and delayed transmission), as well as the data, had correlation patterns which differed from the rest. Colless and Sackin imbalances are highly correlated in every simulation case, scoring a minimum of 0.88 (p < 10\u221215) in Scenario 2 case 8. We did not find negative correlations between cherries and imbalance, though cherries indicate symmetry (near the tips) and imbalance indicates asymmetry (over the whole tree). Unlike other cases, case 8 consistently has a negative correlation between the ILnumber feature and the pitchforks: \u22120.82 (p < 10\u221215) in Scenario 1 and \u22120.52 (p = 3, 5 \u22c5 10\u221212) in Scenario 2. This negative correlation also occurs in the high R0 cases from Scenario 3. In both data-derived groups of trees, the ladder numbers were not correlated with the imbalance measures whereas in most simulations these were tightly correlated. In the data-derived trees there were significant negative correlations between the stairs feature and the imbalance, height and ladder number, which were not present in any of the simulations. The data-derived trees had a weaker correlation between the ladder number and the imbalance than the simulations. In Scenario 3, many small but consistent correlations amongst tree shapes are reversed compared to the rest of the simulations; in particular, imbalance and tree height are not negatively correlated with cherries, pitchforks and stairs. These trees can have a high imbalance simultaneously with high values of symmetric shapes such as cherries, for example. There are strong negative correlations between the number of ladder nodes (ILnumber) and the cherries and pitchfork numbers.",

This makes disentangling the effects of non-exponential waiting times on tree shapes quite complex. We have attempted to construct our study to best explore these different effects, and within this context we have found that tree shapes are quite robust to the non-exponential waiting times we have used.

In the limit where the \u201cburst\u201d becomes very short, each individual spawns offspring at a fixed time after infection. In this case, when we observe the tree, each individual has either reached this time, infected others and completed the infectious burst or not. In such a tree, shape features such as imbalance, the cherry-to-tips ratio and so on remain essentially unchanged over time. In contrast, if the delay is comparable to the pulse width, the first offspring of an individual may infect others before her \u201cyoungest sister\u201d is born.

This is a limitation, as branching events in phylogenies may not always correspond to transmission events in the outbreak. However, when within-host diversity is low, the pathogen evolves in a clock-like manner and accrues sufficient genetic diversity, the branching points in a phylogeny are likely to be very close to transmission events. A related complication is that the \u201ctransmission bottleneck\u201d is not typically known; hosts may initially be infected with more than one pathogen lineage. Finally, hosts may be re-infected and carry multiple lineages as a consequence. We have chosen not to add these additional complexities to our exploration of memory and tree shapes. Indeed, if under models that capture within-host diversity or other complex features, transmission trees can be inferred867, then comparing the shapes of those transmission trees to what might be expected under different intensity functions, as presented here, remains relevant.
