The effective reproduction number is always less than or equal to the basic reproduction number and typically declines gradually as a disease spreads through the population and collective immunity increases. The effective reproduction number was calculated using an adaptation of the method of Bettencourt and co-workers [9]\u2013[11] to allow for imported cases and a distributed serial interval. The adaptation consists of cases being partitioned into local (L) and imported (M) cases and these are tracked in the data so that the new imported cases are not considered to be locally acquired infections and hence are not attributed to infection from previous local cases.",

Implicit in the adaptation used here is the assumption that the imported cases spend their infectious period in the jurisdiction of interest which is reasonable given those cases where reported in that jurisdiction. The model uses discrete Euler time step approximations to the derivatives and so the new imported cases can be added at each discrete time step without affecting the model. The usual SIR infective equation can be written to the same degree of accuracy as in [9]\u2013[11] asAccording to the SIR model, detailed in [9]\u2013[11], the number of newly acquired local cases at time t+\u03c4 due to the L+M cases at time t is then given by:where \u03b3 is the mean infectious period.

The difference between this and that presented in [9]\u2013[11] is that the number of locally acquired cases is used as the data at time t+\u03c4 rather than all cases.

That is, we want to know the probability distribution of R that best fits the available data. From Bayes theorem:The denominator of the right hand side is simply a scaling factor that can be calculated from the sum of the probabilities being 1 and does not need to be explicitly determined. The first term in the numerator is calculated using the Poisson distribution, as discussed above, using the case numbers at time t+\u03c4. P[R] is the prior probability distribution of R, which reflects earlier values of R, either from calculated values or initially from knowledge of the disease. Here an initial unbiased estimate of P[R] is chosen to be a uniform distribution on [0 4], that is any value of R in [0 4] is equally likely. The above equation is iterated to obtain progressively better estimates for the probability distribution of R as time progresses and more data become available. As a probability distribution for R is obtained, compared to other methods that produce a single value for R, a 95% credible interval for the R value is easily obtained.",

Faster convergence and tighter bounds on R are obtained if R is calculated using a weighted sum of L and M stretching back in time beyond the serial interval. The weighting used is the temporal distribution of the serial interval, taken to be gamma distributed here, which weights earlier days relative to how likely the serial interval was to be that long.

Inputs to the model were a fixed reproduction number (R) and a serial interval distribution (f(t), t = 1,\u2026M) as described above. New cases at time t were sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean RS(t)\u2211f(\u03c4)I(t\u2212\u03c4), where S(t) is the fraction of the population susceptible and I(t) are the number of infected individuals at time t. Initially, there were one million susceptible individuals and one infective case was introduced at time zero. We performed 1,000 simulations for each pair of values, and recorded the mean and standard deviation over these simulations. The simulations were not run beyond a total of 5,000 cases, so the results are insensitive to the initial population size, which was chosen large enough so that susceptible depletion was not an issue. Due to the stochastic nature of the method, not all simulations result in an established outbreak, with some resulting in what is known as stochastic die out [19]. Only those simulations that resulted in at least 20 cases were retained.",

One of the most likely sources of heterogeneity for this data arises from age structure [17]. The stochastic SEIR model described above is homogeneous with respect to age structure. This may be a limitation of the model. We therefore tested the impact of age heterogeneity using an alternative model with different reproduction numbers for adults and children (but with the overall reproduction number equal to that of our basic model). In order to test the impact of very high levels of heterogeneity, we assumed that the reproduction number for children was twice that of adults, due to heightened mixing between children and lack of prior immunity. The structured model estimated a reduction in 20\u201325% in the days required to reach the case numbers. In particular, for the intermediate case of a reproduction number of 1.4 and mean serial interval of 2.8 days, the delay was reduced from 33 to 26 days. The Victorian data could not be reproduced with this age-structured heterogeneity without using unrealistically large values of the reproduction number. The same was true of the stochastic SEIR model described above and other common simulation models such as deterministic SIR and SEIR type models [24]. We concluded that, although model structure influenced the estimate of the delay, even very high levels of heterogeneity had a relatively minor impact relative to the effect of the reproduction number or the serial interval, which are the dominant factors in determining the speed of the spread of the outbreak.",

Widespread unrecognised community transmission causing mild infections may have been occurring in Mexico for some weeks or months, eventually leading to recognition of a cluster of severe pneumonia in a sub-group of susceptible young adults in April 2009. This cluster would have represented the apex of the infectious pyramid.",

We suggest that a relatively low clinical attack rate - but a much higher infection rate - by a virus causing generally mild disease would allow community transmission of the virus to go unrecognised for many weeks.
