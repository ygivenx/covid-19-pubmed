            "text": "The recently established virus family Mesoniviridae (order Nidovirales) comprises a group of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA ([+]ssRNA) insect viruses [1]. To date, the six described mesoniviruses, Cavally (CavV), DakNong (DKNG), Hana (HanaV), Meno (MenoV), Nam Dinh (NDiV) and Nse (NseV) have all been isolated from naturally infected mosquitoes collected in just two countries: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (West Africa) and Vietnam (Southeast Asia) [2-5]. Although these mosquito-associated viruses do not appear to infect vertebrates or to cause illness in humans or livestock, they are nonetheless of interest because of the structural and genetic similarities to other members of the order Nidovirales, namely viruses in the families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae. Furthermore, the basal phylogenetic position of the mesoniviruses in relation to the Coronaviridae has led some authors to suggest that the coronaviruses, and possibly other viruses in the order Nidovirales, may have evolved in arthropods [3-5]. Indeed, members of the Roniviridae naturally infect marine shrimp and can cause severe pathology in these economically important arthropods [6].",

These 13 viruses appear to represent four distinct species in the family Mesoniviridae, three of which are novel. Based on their wide geographic distribution, the limited sampling that has been done to date for these mosquito-specific viruses, and their broad species host range in mosquitoes, it seems likely that mesoniviruses are common in mosquito populations worldwide. The potential biological significance and effect of mesoniviruses on mosquito vector competence is also discussed.",

Mature virions ~50 nm in diameter were located at the surface of infected C6/36 cells, either as individual particles or in groups (Figure 1B,D), similar to what has been reported recently [7]. They displayed a dense nucleocapsid core ~40 nm in diameter and surrounding envelope (Figure 1A,B). Mature virions of the same size could also be found inside intracytoplasmic vacuoles (Figure 1A,B,D,E,F,H). Some infected cells had paracrystalline arrays consisting of empty and full virus particles but with less electron-density than mature virions (Figure 1C). At the periphery of these arrays, mature virions could be observed either free in the cytosol or inside vacuoles (Figure 1C). Moreover a recent report [8], suggests that the mesonivirus virion diameter of ~40-50 nm observed by us and others [7] may be significantly lower than its actual size, a discrepancy attributed to the method of preparation for alternative imaging technologies. Employing cryo-electron tomography, Warrilow et al. [8] demonstrated on the surface of some virions the presence of spike-like projections displaying a globular head attached to the virion surface through a low density stalk, similar to what has been observed in other members of the order Nidovirales[9].",

The organization of each genome was similar to that described previously for the mesoniviruses (NDiV, CavV, HanaV, NseV and MenoV), featuring a long 5\u2019-untranslated region (5\u2019-UTR) of 359 to 370 nt, six major long open reading frames (ORFs), and a long terminal region of 1780 to 1804 nt preceding the poly[A] tail (Figure 2). An alignment that also included the five previously described mesoniviruses revealed block insertions in three groups of isolates: i) KP84-0156, KP84-0192 and KP84-0344 had a 180 nt insertion, ii) JKT-9853, JKT-9876, JKT-9891 and JKT-7774 had a 573 nt insertion, and iii) JKT-10701 had a 588 nt insertion. These insertions accounted for most of the observed difference in genome size in the mesoniviruses (Figure 2). Excluding this region, which commenced ~1300 nt from the 5\u2019-terminus, the mesoniviruses shared global nucleotide sequence identity of ~43.7%.

By this method, each of the other previously described mesoniviruses - HanaV MenoV, and NseV \u2013 would also be considered unique species, as the PED between these viruses and all other mesoniviruses were considerably greater than 0.032. These viruses could be assigned to the species Alphamesonivirus-2, Alphamesonivirus-3 and Alphamesonivirus-4, respectively. Similarly, novel viruses BBaV, KSaV and KPhV would each also be assigned to separate mesonovirus species: Alphamesonivirus-5, Alphamesonivirus-6 and Alphamesonivirus-7, respectively. Strikingly, the vast majority of the genetic diversity that was measured within the genus Mesonivirus was present at the inter-species level (Additional file 1: Figure S1). This pattern strongly supports the assignment of the current diversity of mesoniviruses into seven distinct species.",

In CavV, the S protein (p77) has been shown to be generated from the full-length ORF2a polyprotein by internal signalase cleavage at the site 220NAHC|STRID and is further processed to generate cleavage products S1 (p23) and S2 (p57), each of which is a structural component of virions [5]. A MUSCLE alignment of all available mesonivirus ORF2a polyprotein sequences (Additional file 3: Figure S3) indicated that the signalase cleavage site is relatively variable conforming only to the sequence motif [C/S]|[L/A/S]TRIDL and that the S1-S2 cleavage site (R|WDSSYV) is highly conserved. The S protein, a class I transmembrane glycoprotein with a C-terminal transmembrane domain, features a set of 12 conserved cysteine residues which are likely to form 6 disulphide bridges, and 7 to 11 potential N-glycosylation sites, only 4 of which are conserved across all mesoniviruses. Surprisingly, an N-terminal signal peptide is strongly predicted for the MenoV S protein (between amino acids A20 and S21) but not for those of any of the other mesoniviruses (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). There is a relatively high level of amino acid sequence conservation in the S1 and S2 proteins (47.2% and 51.7% global identify, respectively). However, the N-terminal product of signalase cleavage of the ORF2a polyprotein displays very low sequence conservation amongst the mesoniviruses (7.4% global identity). This product, which is predicted to be positioned on the inside of the ER membrane (TMHMM server; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0) has not yet been identified in virions or infected cells.",

However, our analysis using pknotsRG of the 13 new mesonivirus sequences and those of CavV, HanaV, NDiV, NseV and MenoV indicated that, although the slippery sequence (GGAUUUU) is completely conserved, the stem-loop structure predicted for NDiV is not predicted as the minimum free energy structure for any of the other viruses. Indeed, an alignment of the corresponding region of the genome of all mesoniviruses (Additional file 5: Figure S5) indicated that there was poor conservation of this sequence and few compensatory mutations that would preserve the stem-loop structure (Figure 5a). As functional pseudoknot structures are usually conserved, an alignment of all mesonivirus sequences extending 150 nt from the start of the \u2018slippery sequence\u2019 was analyzed using the IPknot server (http://rna.naist.jp/ipknot) which predicts the consensus secondary structure from a multiple sequence alignment (by using integer programming to select the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure) [10].

The close similarity of isolates from Houston and Vietnam may suggest a recent translocation, possibly during the Vietnam conflict when Houston hosted a major air base for embarkation/disembarkation.

If a bacterial endosymboint can alter a mosquito\u2019s vector competence for arboviruses, it seems plausible that a viral symbiont could have a similar effect [14]. This is an important area for future investigation.",

Firstly, the presence of block insertions of up to 588 nt in the 5\u2019 terminal quadrant of ORF1a of several mesoniviruses has not been reported previously. The function of this region is presently unknown in mesoniviruses and other nidoviruses and so the structural and functional consequences of these insertions, which contain various imperfect repeats is unclear. Although sharing similar genome architecture, nidoviruses vary greatly in genome size. A previous analysis of the evolution of nidovirus genomes concluded that genome expansion has occurred in a wave-like fashion in which the three major coding regions (ORF1b, ORF1a and the 3\u2019ORFs) expanded consecutively in a hierarchy that reflects the roles of their encoded proteins in the virus replication cycle [15]. This implies that nidoviruses have an inherent capacity for genome expansion, most likely associated with the transitional retention of sequences that serve as a resource for the evolution of new functions. The block insertions detected in ORF1a appear to be functionally redundant and their potential role in such evolutionary processes is presently unclear.",

However, the predicted structure featured only four relatively short regions of complementarity and no estimations of minimum free energy for the represented structures are available through this algorithm. A possible \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence (CACUUUU) was also detected in the ORF3a/ORF3b overlap region but no conserved stem-loop or pseudoknot structure was predicted by IPknot in the downstream sequence. It is, therefore, unclear whether ORF3b is expressed by internal initiation or as a read-through extension of ORF3a, which would generate a double-membrane spanning protein. Functional analysis of each of the regions corresponding to the RFS in ORF1a/ORF1b and the putative RFS in ORF3a/ORF3b would help resolve the mechanisms of mesonivirus gene expression.",
