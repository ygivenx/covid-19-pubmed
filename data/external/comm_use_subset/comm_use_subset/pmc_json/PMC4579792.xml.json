[10] reported that approximately 30 % of healthy and diarrheic thoroughbred foals in central Kentucky in the United States were infected with ECoV, using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. These results indicate that ECoV is prevalent among thoroughbred foals in central Kentucky. In Japan, ECoV outbreaks had previously occurred only in the draft racehorse population. Draft racehorses include French Percheron, Breton and Belgian horses, with body weights around 1000 kg. Outbreaks of ECoV had not been reported in the Japanese thoroughbred horse population, and its epidemiology is poorly understood. It is also unclear whether ECoV is related to diarrhea in Japanese foals. Therefore, we investigated ECoV using molecular diagnostic methods on rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, which is the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region in Japan.",

They were transported to the diagnostic laboratory at around \u221218 \u00b0C, and after arrival they were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Additionally, 120 rectal swabs were collected from 120 healthy foals on 30 farms in the same region in 2012 by using BD BBL CultureSwab Plus (Becton, Dickinson and Company). Healthy foals were between 1 and 80 days of age. Rectal swabs from healthy foals were stored and transported at 4 \u00b0C for several days. After arrival, they were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. These samples were immersed in maintenance medium [11] or phosphate buffered saline.

Using 120 rectal swabs collected from healthy foals, only three samples (2.5 %) were positive for ECoV. Rectal swabs from healthy foals preserved at worse condition than that of diarrheic foals as described above. However, ECoV was only detected in rectal swabs from healthy foals, and therefore it is unclear whether storage condition influenced the result in this study. Compared with central Kentucky, ECoV is not prevalent among thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but some outbreaks have occurred in draft racehorses. One reason for the lack of ECoV positive samples in thoroughbred foals may be that they do not usually have contact with draft horses. These results suggest that the prevalence of ECoV varies greatly depending on region. To further show this, it is necessary to investigate ECoV in other countries as well.",

In contrast, Hidaka-No.119/2012 did not come from an Obihiro12-1-like virus based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Ultimately, Hidaka-No.61/2012- and Hidaka-No.119/2012-like viruses did not establish themselves in thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido, because ECoV was not detected in any diarrheic samples in 2013 or 2014.",
