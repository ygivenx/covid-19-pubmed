Other triggers are cold air, smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and viral infection [1\u20134]. Several viral infections induce asthma exacerbation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are known to be major causes of asthma exacerbations in children [5\u20137]. Infection with these viruses in infants was associated with a higher incidence of asthma onset [8, 9]. The prevalence of virus detection in adult asthmatic exacerbation was reported to the range of 41\u201378% [10]. Among these viruses, HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold [11] HRV infection causes asthma due to its potential for a Th2-biased response [12, 13]. Influenza virus (IF) infection also induces asthma attacks in adults [10, 14]. The prevalence of IF infection with asthmatic exacerbation in adults is higher than that in children [10]. However, whether other viruses induce asthma exacerbations in adults remains unknown.",

Mast cells express toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on their surface [20]. TLR4 is a receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as a major receptor for RSV [21]. After stimulation of TLR4 ligands, mast cells induce a subset of genes that include a Th2 cytokine and chemokines that recruit Th2 cells and eosinophils [20]. Eosinophils express TLR7 and TLR8 [22]. TLR7 activation inhibits viral replication in the lung and prevents virus-induced airway hyperreactivity [23]. Bronchial epithelial cells express ICAM-1, which is upregulated by HRV infection [24, 25]. Smooth muscle cells express functional TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and NOD1 with induction of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF release and upregulation of ICAM-1 by HRV infection [26, 27].",

These results indicate that bacteria other than H. influenzae contributed to asthma exacerbation in clinical practice.

            "text": "There are some limitations in this study. Although 98% of asthma exacerbation inpatients had a history of a common cold before their asthma attack, a pathogen was detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in only 70% of patients. Overall, 15 major viruses and 6 major bacteria were evaluated by multiplex PCR analysis. It is possible that other minor pathogens may be involved in asthma exacerbations in clinical practice. Another possible reason for the low yield is inappropriate timing of the taking of nasal swabs. The pathogen causing the common cold may have disappeared at the time the nasal swab was taken in some patients. Another reason is that some patients may have only had a lower respiratory tract infection. The symptom from the patients with allergic rhinitis may be misinterpreted as being due to a respiratory infection. Furthermore, this study is not a result from longitudinal data. We checked the microbes only once on admission. If we check the microbes several times, we can clearly elucidate whether the detected microbe is infection or colonization. Several pathogens were different between stable outpatients and asthma exacerbation inpatients. However, only the detection rate of S. pneumoniae was statisitically significant because the number of stable outpatients was too small compared to asthma exacerbation inpatients. If we could get the larger number of outpatients, other pathogen may be related to asthma exacerbation.",
