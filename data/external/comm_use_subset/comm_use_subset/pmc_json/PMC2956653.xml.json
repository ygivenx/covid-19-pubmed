Pathogenic microbes often escape detection if the clinical consequences of infection are similar to known pathogens or if they infect non-domestic species [3]. The maintenance of unknown pathogens in wildlife species is particularly problematic because many emerging human and livestock infections arise from contact with wild animals [4]\u2013[7].",

Moreover, although the blood and the lymph systems are considered to be essentially free of viable microorganisms in healthy individuals, the transient and often asymptomatic presence of both bacteria and viruses have been detected in the circulation [30], [31]. Phagocytic cells engulf these microbes and migrate to lymph nodes. Thus, lymph nodes should concentrate the commensal, endemic, and potential pathogenic microbial communities of a host species.",

Firmicutes and Actinobacteria represented 22% and 5% of the identified bacterial taxa. Table S3 lists all bacterial genera detected in the seven data sets. Transcripts assigned to Archaea, family Halobacteriaceae, were identified in both pooled samples but none of the individual libraries. Only 37 transcripts were assigned to viruses. Twenty-nine of these matched to the Retroviridae and Poxviridae while the remaining were to phages, insect viruses, and a single assignment to herpesvirus.

Based on protein-coding sequences, only four bacterial genera were identified in the comprehensive MEGAN analysis of the four genomic data sets. Xylella and Burkholderia were identified in MD 72360, Acidovorax was found in MD 84709, and Bartonella was found in both MD 84709 and MD 84730. Bartonella and Xylella, as well as a member of the beta retroviruses (found in MD 80228 and MD 84709), were identified only in the genomic DNA data, suggesting that they might not represent actively replicating organisms.

Notably, Helicobacter was only detected in the library constructed from MD 257 but there were 12 unique transcript-tags assigned to this genus. More commonly, bacterial taxon identification was based on a single tag. Many of the single transcript-tags came from MD 80228, which had the highest bacterial diversity profile of all libraries analyzed, and from MD 84730. Bacterial genera detected solely in either one or both of these two samples include Acinetobacter, Legionella, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, Listeria, Mannheimia, and members of the Corynebacterineae, all of which contain known pathogens. In addition, both specimens depicted by far the highest numbers of reads taxonomically assigned to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The lowest diversity of bacterial genera was found in the MD OCT-pool, which was derived from eight different mule deer. Pooling RNA from several animals potentially increases the representation of transcripts common to all animals but might decrease the ability to detect transcripts that are unique to one animal. Consistent with this, the MD Bonner-pool, which was derived from four animals, provided a broader spectrum of bacterial genera than the MD OCT-pool. Thus, pooling samples did not improve our ability to detect microbial diversity in lymph node samples.",

Although the cDNA used in our analyses was derived from total RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA, it retained a considerable amount of the abundant ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These sequences contribute to the \u2018no hits\u2019 category in Figure 1 and Table S2. Bacterial rRNA derived from the same dataset can, therefore, be used to provide additional support for species identification. By classifying the rRNA-tags from each library using the RDP rRNA classifier tool [34], [35] (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) we increased the number of bacterial genera identified (see Fig. 2 for MD 257, Fig. S1 for MD 80228 and MD OCT-pool, and Table S4). Abiotrophia, which is a component of the normal oral and intestinal microbial community, was detected in six of the seven libraries; environmental bacteria such as Thermoanaerobacter, which is frequently found in hot springs, were detected in four of the seven samples. Other genera that were identified based on rRNA in at least two of the libraries were Actinomyces, Campylobacter and Mycoplasma. Of particular importance, rRNA-tags supported the presence of Helicobacter in the MD 257 library (Fig. 2), of Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella and Variovorax in the MD 80228 library, and of Shigella in the MD Bonner-pool library (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, Tables S3 and S4).",

Because 16S rRNA sequence data is available for more species, we were able to further demonstrate that the closest relative to mule deer Helicobacter is a newly described H. cetorum isolated from different dolphin species (Lagenorhynchus acutus, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, and Tursiops truncatus) and a beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) [36] (Fig. 3A).",

Retroviruses integrate into the host genome as part of their replication cycle, thus transcription of viral genes can be persistent in infected animals. Overall four transcript-tags were assigned to gamma retroviruses of the family Retroviridae. Based on the transcript-tag from the MD Bonner-pool and an upstream region that is conserved in gamma retroviruses, PCR fragments were amplified and sequenced from MD 191 cDNA, which was used in the MD Bonner-pool, and from genomic DNA of MD 80228. These sequences were compared to other gamma retrovirus sequences using maximum likelihood methods (Fig. 4). The mule deer gamma retrovirus forms a distinct clade within the gamma retroviruses, which has many well-described members of primate, murine, and feline origin. A newly described gamma retrovirus from killer whale (Orcinus orca) [38] is the closest relative of this mule deer retrovirus. The killer whale virus was described as an endogenous retrovirus based on its finding in various tissues and individuals. However, our detection of transcripts to this virus in only three of the libraries and the sequence variation in the PCR fragment between genomic (MD 80228) and transcript-derived (MD 191) mule deer samples suggest that both endogenous and exogenous gamma retroviruses might be present.",

            "text": "In our study, we faced the computational challenge of detecting a rare microbial community in a dominant pool of host genetic material. We utilized transcript-based libraries because there is an amplification of protein-coding sequences during transcription, which increased our detection ability and provided support that the identified microorganisms were viable. Further, the database for protein-coding regions is more extensive than that for non-coding regions for non-reference organisms. Thus, focusing on transcripts should facilitate classification of novel organisms and those without complete genome coverage. Indeed, our study demonstrates that at the moderate sequencing depth employed, there were more assignable sequencing tags to protein-coding regions utilizing cDNA compared to genomic DNA, which consequently increased our ability to detect microbial taxa. In addition, transcriptome sequencing yields bacterial ribosomal RNA, which is highly expressed in metabolically active microorganisms and is well documented as a taxonomic tool for bacteria. Because single protein-coding or rRNA transcript-tags from a putative microorganism were frequently encountered, our confidence in taxonomic assignment increased by employing bioinformatics methods to classify organisms based on both types of transcripts. Amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing increased the sensitivity to detect members of some bacterial classes. However, primer specific methods do not provide as comprehensive a perspective on the microbiota due to a possible amplification bias towards more abundant taxa or those exhibiting higher primer specificity. Therefore, neither our metatranscriptomic nor amplicon sequencing approaches should be considered quantitative. We note that in samples that are highly enriched for actively replicating microbial organisms, such as environmental samples or gastrointestinal tract specimens, cDNA-based approaches can yield an abundance of small RNA produced by complex microbial communities, which can facilitate studies on microbial ecology but be less useful for identification of individual microbes [49]. In addition established metagenomics or metatranscriptomic [11], [50], [51] approaches that utilize sample fractionation methods for microbial enrichment will likely provide a more comprehensive profile of the community structure. These methods were not applicable to our samples, which included phagocytized microorganisms and viable microbes that were not robustly proliferating. Nevertheless, as deeper sequencing of cDNA libraries using newer high-throughput sequencing methods becomes more accessible, it could complement the Roche-454 pyrosequencing data, potentially covering the entire viable microbial community.",

In the analyzed samples, we identified members of all bacterial phyla, as well as archaea, a DNA virus and a Retrovirus. The bacteria were representative of organisms that are commensal to mule deer and to their external environment. For example, we detected the common rumen and intestine dwellers, Ruminococcus and Abiotrophia, based on transcript- and rRNA-tags, respectively, in most libraries, indicating that commensal gut and mucosal microorganisms may routinely be sampled in secondary lymphoid tissue, presumably from transient bacteremia. Streptomyces was the most common soil dwelling bacteria identified. Of interest, Legionella, which is found near hot springs, was identified only in an individual mule deer from the Yellowstone region. The finding of a considerable number of archaeal transcripts in MD OCT-pool and MD Bonner-pool libraries implies that members of this domain of life are likely present in mule deer habitats or resident in mule deer gastrointestinal tracts, as has been recently documented in humans [52]. Correspondingly, environmental bacteria identified in healthy deer lymph nodes may reflect the animal's habitat.",

However, viral detection may be more difficult than bacterial identification using this technology in part due to extensive sequence diversity among viruses in the same family. For example, we were only able to detect the gamma retrovirus because a transcript was present which was homologous to a conserved region of the viral env gene, and the cervid poxvirus was detected because sequence data for this virus was present in the database. Other persistent viruses, such as herpes viruses (for which we detected a single transcript), would be expected to be present in some animals. However, detection of latent herpes virus infection may be difficult because protein-coding transcript levels are low and latent viruses express non-coding RNA [53]. In addition, viral detection can be compromised if viral sequence tags were misassigned to the host organism because of homology of viral and host genes. Thus, many virus tags might be found among the host transcripts or in the not-assigned or no-hits groups of the MEGAN analysis, which together comprise nearly half of the total sequenced transcript-tags of our data.",

Phylogenetic evaluation of Helicobacter transcripts and 16S rRNA from the MD 257 cDNA library placed this new organism in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis/Helicobacter cetorum complex. All members of this complex have been associated with gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in humans and animals [36], [54]\u2013[56]. Our detection of this bacterium in only one animal suggests that this Helicobacter is not a mule deer commensal. Of interest in this respect is the high incidence of H. pylori infections and gastric ulcers in American Indian populations from the same geographical area in central Montana [57]. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were identified in MD 80228 libraries based on all detection methods used (cDNA transcripts for protein-coding and rRNA, and amplicon rRNA). Phylogenetic evaluation of Acinetobacter transcripts and 16S rRNA from the MD 80228 cDNA library placed the respective reads in close relationship to Acinetobacter schindleri. Acinetobacter species are important environmental organisms, however they also are notable pathogens. In particular, Acinetobacter schindleri infections appear to be increasing in prevalence in hospitalized patients [37], [58].
