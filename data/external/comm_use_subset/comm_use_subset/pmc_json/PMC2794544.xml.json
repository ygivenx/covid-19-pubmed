Their genome organisation and structure are typical for picornaviruses, possessing a 7200 base single stranded RNA genome and a non-enveloped virion of approximately 30 nm in diameter. Human rhinoviruses were originally classifiable into two species, A and B with likely distinct evolutionary separate origins within the Enterovirus genus. However, they both share a primary tropism for the respiratory tract and species B and most species A variants use the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 receptor for entry [2]. Being acid-labile, HRVs do not colonise the gut, and are most commonly transmitted by the respiratory-salivary route, both by person-to-person contact and airborne transmission. In temperate countries, infections occur primarily in two peaks, the first between April and May and the second between September and October [3], [4].",

Although species C variants have not yet been isolated or cultured in vitro and therefore cannot be formally assigned into separate serotypes, existing sequence data reveals perhaps even greater genetic heterogeneity than found within HRV-A and HRV-B. The large number of distinct genetic lineages identifiable by sequence comparisons in the VP4/VP2 gene region may thus correspond to different serotypes of HRV-C [13], [18], [19]. Furthermore, sequence divergence in VP1 and other external regions of the capsid is actually greater than between different HRV-A or \u2013B serotypes, implying the existence of major antigenic differences that influence immunological cross-protection in this newly discovered species. An additional aspect of HRV-C genetic diversity that has caused confusion in previous attempts at HRV species identification and typing is the occurrence of recombination between HRV-A and HRV-A in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR). While species A and B rhinoviruses have phylogenetically distinct sequences in this region, those from the majority of HRV-C variants resemble those of species A [19]\u2013[21], while the remainder form a phylogenetically separate group distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B and other enterovirus species. Initial data however shows no differences in clinical presentations between HRV-C variants with A and C 5\u2032UTR-like sequences (described as HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc respectively [19]; this nomenclature will be followed in the current study).",

Non-selective amplification of all HRV (and HEV) species using previously developed 5\u2032UTR-based PCR methods would have identified an extremely large number of non-HRV-C positive samples that would preclude effective screening using pools. To overcome this, we modified the VP4/VP2-encoding region PCR previously used for genetic characterisation and (sero)type identification of HRV to enable selective amplification of HRV-C. The inner antisense primer was repositioned to a more variable position in the VP4 gene between species A, B and C sequences to enable selective hybridisation and strand extension of HRV-C sequences. The sensitivity and specificity of the selective PCR was evaluated using samples previously identified as HRV-A, -B and \u2013C variants in a previous study [18]. All 26 species C samples were positive, along with 1 from 63 species A and 1 from 8 species B samples in the assay (sensitivity 100%; 98% specificity). Since all positive samples were to be sequenced in the more variable VP4/VP2-encoding region, this minor degree of non-specificity would not influence our identification of HRV-C positive samples for the study.",

This analysis was assisted by inclusion of those published HRV-C for which VP4/VP2 gene sequences and 5\u2032UTR groups had been determined (including the 9 available complete genome sequences of HRV-C; data not shown). The majority of HRV-C variants characterised in the current study from separate infection episodes (96 from 141; 68%) contained species A-like 5\u2032UTR sequences, termed HRV-Ca [19]. Clades and HRV-C types with different 5\u2032UTR groups (HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc) were interspersed within the VP4/VP2 gene tree (Fig. 1), implying the existence of multiple recombination events in the past diversification of HRV-C. In general, all variants of the same (geno)type assigned in the VP4/VP2-encoding region contained the same 5\u2032UTR group. There were however, two exceptions, the HRV-Ca samples R3856/07 clustered closely with HRV-Cc variants (Fig. 1) and there was a split of one of the genotypes into HRV-Ca (published sequences from China) HRV-Cc (7 samples amplified from 5 different study subject from Edinburgh). These observations imply ongoing, bi-directional and frequently recent recombination events between rhinoviruses with different 5\u2032UTR groups.",

RSV mono-infection was found in 10.7% samples but virtually absent among HRV-C infected subjects (2.4%, p<0.001). For other respiratory viruses (excluding AdV), a 3.5-fold reduction in their infection frequency was observed in HRV-C co-infected subjects (12.9% to 3.7%; p<0.001). This reduction was greater than the effect of RSV co-infection on their detection frequency (<2-fold). In contrast, RSV and the group of other respiratory viruses did not significantly influence the likelihood of HRV-C detection; study subjects showed a 5.8% HRV-C mono-infection frequency compared to 4.6% and 8.6% in those co-infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses respectively (p>0.05).

Through genetic comparisons of the VP4/VP2-encoding region, HRV-C infections were found to be almost invariably acute/resolving with no evidence for persistence among multiply sampled individuals with the single exception of an immunocompromised child with AML. Where re-infection did occur, it was invariably by another HRV-C type, consistent with the hypothesis that species C types that have been assigned on the basis of VP4/VP2 gene sequence divergence, might nevertheless be antigenically distinct and capable of infection in those exposed previously to heterologous types. These findings are consistent with previous observations for a 10\u201321 day period of virus shedding of HRV in immunocompetent individuals [23]\u2013[26]. Given the high incidence of HRV infections and ongoing exposure to other circulating (sero)types, molecular characterisation is required to clearly document HRV persistence [27].",

Nevertheless the most parsimonious explanation for the scattering of HRV-Cc and HRV-Ca variants in the VP4/VP2 tree is a series of recombination events early in the diversification of the ancestor of HRV-C into the current large number of types that now exist. Had there been only one recombination event between species A and C, the descendants of the original recombinant (with its more recent evolutionary origin relative to rhinoviruses circulating at that time) would be expected to have remained more closely related to each other (monophyletic) in both 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 gene regions (and elsewhere in the genome). This is clearly not the case in the VP4/VP2 gene region (Fig. 1) or in the 5\u2032UTR; published HRV-Ca variants (those of complete genome sequences and from China) fall into at least two separate groups in the latter region [19].

However, a variant in the current study differed in 5\u2032UTR group from other members of the same type (the HRV-Ca strain R3856/07 clustered with HRV-Cc variants). Although these anomalous results have been verified by independent re-extraction and re-amplification of the sample and other members of the clades into which it grouped, it remains formally possible that the study subject was co-infected with two different rhinovirus variants. PCR assays using 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 gene primers may have amplified a different (species A-like) 5\u2032UTR sequence from that possessed by the species C virus sequenced in the VP4 gene. Notwithstanding this, another recent (intra-typic) recombination event could be inferred between a cluster of closely related HRV-Cc variants from the current study and several published HRV-Ca sequences from China that are of the same species C type (Fig. 1). Given this evidence for frequent and likely ongoing recombination, it remains difficult to explain why there are no known species A rhinovirus recombinants with species C 5\u2032UTR sequences; perhaps ongoing recombination events are restricted to those between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc.",

The large number of HRV-C infection episodes detected over this period allowed a number of relatively robust conclusions to be drawn. Firstly, the study identifies young children and infants as the main target group for HRV-C infection among predominantly hospitalised individuals, with an age profile comparable to that of RSV. For both viruses, over 80% of infections were observed in those less than 2 years of age (Fig. 3), higher than in AdV (77%), influenza A virus (44%) and other respiratory viruses (63%). The targeting of very young children was comparable to that observed for HRV species A (80%; [18]) and in previous investigations of all three HRV species [13], [14], [29], [30]. HRV-C similarly resembled other rhinovirus species in its seasonal distribution (Fig. 2), circulating throughout the year as reported for other rhinoviruses [3], [13], [25], [29], [31]. It did not however show the typically higher incidence in autumn found in other rhinoviruses (and human enteroviruses), and actually showed higher infection frequencies in winter months. However, a longer study period would be required to discount the effect of year-on-year fluctuations in the incidence of species C.",

            "text": "It is increasingly recognised that HRVs are collectively underestimated as a cause of significant respiratory illness [27], [32]. The frequent detection of HRV-C mono-infection in a substantial proportion of subjects presenting with LRTIs and URTIs (Fig. 4) is concordant with recent PCR-based studies [13]\u2013[17], [29], [33], [34] that demonstrate a numerically significant role for HRV-C and other rhinovirus species in severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalisation in children and exacerbation of asthma. Detection frequencies of 7\u20138% for HRV-C in subjects with URTIs or LRTIs was significantly higher than in those presenting without respiratory disease in the current study (3.7%), although this approximate two-fold difference in frequency was less than observed between these categories for RSV and hMPV (4- and 6.5-fold), parainfluenza viruses (5-fold), but greater than for adenoviruses and coronaviruses (1.5- and 1.8-fold) and other viruses (HBoV/HPeV; equal frequencies). To our knowledge, there is no published information on the rate of asymptomatic infections with species C rhinoviruses in hospitalised patients or in the general community. However, total HRV detection frequencies determined by PCR have produced highly variable results (2\u201361%; reviewed in [27]), although averaging to 15% [35]. Taking this latter average estimate, and assuming that species C variants constitute a quarter or a third of all HRV detections (as previously found in a subset of the current study population; [18]), then the 4%\u20135% predicted prevalence matches closely to that of the control group in the current study. The increased frequency in the LRTI and URTI groups is therefore consistent with its proposed aetiological role in respiratory disease among the predominantly hospitalised study subjects in the current study. Further prospectively collected information on disease severity and symptoms, along with viral load information on study subjects and controls are, however, required to further substantiate the findings reported here.",

This allowed a detailed investigation of frequencies of virus co-infections among subjects presenting with respiratory illnesses and potential interactions (positive and negative) between them. The most striking observation was the evidence for interference of RSV and other respiratory viruses (except adenovirus) by HRV-C. For example, the 10.7% detection frequency of RSV among single-infected individuals was markedly reduced among those co-infected with HRV-C (2.4%). A comparable reduction was observed in the \u201cother virus\u201d category (predominantly parainfluenza and coronaviruses with a 3.5-fold difference). RSV showed a more modest effect on detection frequencies in this latter category (less than two-fold reduction). The further observation that the presence of RSV or other viruses did not conversely influence HRV-C detection frequencies is consistent with HRV-C interfering with susceptibility to infection with other RNA viruses rather than the opposite. Negative interactions in detection frequency and viral loads comparable to those observed between these RNA virus groups have been previously described between different pairs of respiratory viruses, and report significant interfering effects of HRV (all species) on RSV and a range of other RNA viruses [36], [37]. In contrast to the latter study, we additionally found positive interactions, with significantly higher detection frequencies of RSV and other RNA viruses in AdV-positive samples.",

            "text": "Interpreting the mechanisms underlying these observations of virus interference is complex. One unknown factor in this and previous studies that may significantly contribute to the outcome of a virus/virus interaction is the order of acquisition of infections. For example, it has been hypothesised that the strong interferon (IFN) response in the respiratory tract induced by HRV infection may create an environment hostile to infection with other viruses, such as RSV [36]. Even though RSV, through expression of NS-1, can prevent IFN induction on infection of a cell [38], this countermeasure may be largely ineffective in a respiratory tract already induced into an antiviral state by prior infection with HRV-C. If, however, RSV infected the respiratory tract first, then this would have no effect on the subsequent susceptibility of the individual to HRV. The rapid and highly cytopathic replication cycle of rhinoviruses (and enteroviruses) that seems designed to infect and escape from cells before IFN-mediated responses become effective, may indeed have a more general interfering effect on more sensitive RNA (and DNA viruses) that infect the respiratory tract. Like RSV, successful colonisation of the respiratory tract by coronaviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses is dependent on a wide variety of evolved mechanisms to evade intracellular defences [39], [40] that are ineffective in pre-sensitised cells induced by IFN into an antiviral state.",

The study incorporated previously collected data from 456 samples collected in September, 2006 and February, 2007 [18]. Samples comprised predominantly nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates or swabs (n = 1771), throat swabs (n = 619) and bronchoalveolar lavages (n = 155), and were routinely screened for the following respiratory viruses by PCR: adenovirus (AdV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133 (PIV1-3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using previously described assays [42], [43]. Samples were further tested for human bocavirus (HBoV), human parechovirus (HPeV) [44], human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [45] and coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63 (Gaunt et al., manuscript in preparation). All but 94 (2.9%) of the tested samples were referred from hospital inpatients or from Accident and Emergency Departments. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were identified in subjects presenting with the following symptoms or diagnoses: bronchiolitis, chest infections, pneumonia, respiratory failure, shortness of breath, apnoea and wheeze; upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) with coryza, sore throat, tonsillitis and tracheitis. Cough was also classified as an URTI symptom, although we acknowledge its additional potential association with lower respiratory tract disease that leads to some potential misclassification of disease categories in the absence of other respiratory symptoms. Subjects with no relevant respiratory symptoms included the referral categories of vomiting, diarrhoea, trauma and elective cardiac surgery.",

Reverse transcription of RNA extracted from individual samples or pools of ten with random hexamers used the RT system (Promega, United Kingdom) as described previously [44]. Amplification of the HRV-C VP4/VP2-encoding region used previously described primers and reaction conditions [18], with a repositioned antisense inner primer (\nATA GTR ATT TGY TTD AGC CTA TCD GAV A\n; 5\u2032 base at position 888 numbered here and elsewhere according to the HRV species B reference sequence NC_001490) for selective amplification of HRV-C (see Results). Underlined bases were designed to mismatch species A or B (or both) sequences while being conserved within species C. Positive samples were subsequently amplified with the four original VP4/VP2 gene primers [18] and the amplicon directly sequenced. Sequences generated from this study were edited and aligned with published sequences using the Simmonics sequence editor v1.7 ([46], http://www.virus-evolution.org). Published sequences included the 9 complete genome sequences of HRV-C available on GenBank and all species C VP4(/VP2) gene sequences available on GenBank in August 2009. HRV-C types were putatively assigned by phylogenetic analysis and uncorrected pairwise distance measurements using the previously proposed 10% divergence threshold [18]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour joining from 100 samplings of maximum-composite-likelihood (MCL) distances using the MEGA 4.0 software package [47] with pairwise deletion for missing data. VP4/VP2 sequences generated in this study have been assigned GenBank accession numbers GU294336-GU294480.",
