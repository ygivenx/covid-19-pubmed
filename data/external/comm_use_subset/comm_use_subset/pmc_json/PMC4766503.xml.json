Among all short peptides, P9 showed the strongest antiviral activity (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, the dose-dependent antiviral effect of P9 was stronger than those of synthetic mBD4 (smBD4) and recombinant mBD4 (rmBD4). In particular, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of P9 was 1.2 \u03bcg/ml, which was lower than those of smBD4 (3.2 \u03bcg/ml) and rmBD4 (1.5 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the 50% toxic concentrations (TC50) of P9, smBD4 and rmBD4 were 380, 280 and 360 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1c). The selectivity index of P9 was 316, which was higher than those of smBD4 (87) and rmBD4 (240). Notably, both of the liquid form and powder form of P9 demonstrated stable shelf lives as they exhibited similar antiviral activity after storing at \u221220 \u00b0C for more than 1 year (Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, among smBD4, rmBD4 and the 11 peptides derived from mBD4, P9 exhibited the highest antiviral activity and selectivity index. Thus, P9 was selected for further studies.",

The mice were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with P9 (50 \u03bcg/mouse) or rmBD4 and then i.n. challenged with lethal dose of H1N1 virus. The dose of 50 \u03bcg/mouse was applied for animal experiments because it was shown to protect all mice from lethal challenge of H1N1 virus. The survival rate of P9-pretreated mice (100%) was significantly higher than those of rmBD4-pretreated mice (20%, P < 0.01) and untreated mice (0%, P < 0.0001). Notably, pretreatment with P9 and Zanamivir achieved a similar protection effect (Fig. 2a). In parallel, when the mice were i.n. inoculated with 3 doses (50 \u03bcg/dose/day) of P9, rmBD4 or Zanamivir at six hours after the lethal challenge with the virus (Fig. 2b), the survival rate in P9-treated mice (60%) were significantly higher than those of untreated control and rmBD4-treated mice (P < 0.05). In this setting, treatment of zanamivir yielded a similar level of protection (80%) in comparison to P9 (P > 0.05). All infected mice suffered from body weight lost regardless of treatment types. However, the survived mice began to regain body weight at ~10\u201312 days post-infection (Fig. 2c,d).",

When P9 was supplemented to the culture medium at 1 hour after MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 virus (2 MOI), viral RNA copies inside the cells (Fig. 4a) and in culture supernatants (Fig. 4b) harvested at the indicated hours post-infection were comparable with those in the untreated control (P > 0.05). The results suggested that P9 did not inhibit viral replication or release. When the virus was pretreated with P9 and then added to the cells (0.3 MOI), viral loads both inside the cells (Fig. 4c) and in culture supernatants were significantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, the viral loads inside the cells (Fig. 4d) and in supernatants (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d) were similar to those of the untreated control when the cells were pretreated with P9 followed by infection. These results indicated that P9 inhibited virus infection by interacting directly with the virus. We further demonstrated that P9 could bind to surface glycoprotein HA of influenza virus (Fig. 4e,f) and S2 of MERS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, our results indicated that P9 inhibited viral infections through binding to viral surface glycoproteins.",

H1N1 virus carrying a green fluorescent label was pretreated with P9 and then incubated with the cells at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hours. We found that P9-pretreated virus bound to the cellular membrane in a similar manner compared to the untreated virus (Fig. 5a, left). P9-pretreated virus entered the cells through endocytosis after the virus was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour (Fig. 5a, middle). Furthermore, the transport of the virus in endosomes from the cell periphery to the proximity of the nucleus was not affected when the virus was pretreated by P9 (Fig. 5a, right). The colocalization of the virus with P9 further confirmed the binding of P9 to the virus, its internalization into cells and its subsequent transport to the perinuclear region together with the virus (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, the levels of viral RNA in infected cells remained essentially unchanged during the first 2 hours post-infection regardless of P9 treatment (Fig. 5c), suggesting that P9 did not inhibit viral binding and entry. The viral RNA levels in cells infected with untreated virus increased at 3.5 hours post-infection, indicative of the initiation of nascent viral RNA replication. In contrast, the viral RNA levels in the cells infected with P9-pretreated virus did not increase until 6.5 hours post-infection and was significantly lower than that of untreated virus control (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5c). These results implicated that P9 perturbed viral uncoating and viral RNA release from late endosomes for subsequent replication.",

Bearing in mind the basic amino acid-rich composition of P9, we examined whether P9 could block viral RNA release by counteracting endosomal acidification. As shown in Fig. 6a, P9 showed similar antiviral effects in comparison to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and Bafilomycin A1, which are well-defined inhibitors of endosomal acidification212223. In contrast, Zanamivir, which inhibits viral release, did not show a similar antiviral kinetics in comparison to the endosomal acidification inhibitors. Therefore, P9, NH4Cl and Bafilomycin A1 might share a similar antiviral mechanism of inhibiting pH decrease in endosomes. To confirm this hypothesis, we detected the pH change in endosomes using a pH-sensitive dye, the intensity of which mirrored the acidity of the cellular milieu. Red signals in the cells infected with untreated virus (VC) indicated the acidification process in endosomes (Fig. 6b). In contrast to the control, when the cells were infected with virus pretreated with P9, NH4Cl or Bafilomycin A1, little to no any red signals were observed, indicating that acidification was abolished in the endosomes. To verify this, we designed a P9 analog named P9-aci-1 containing three additional acidic amino acids at the C-terminus (Table 1). If P9 acts through perturbation of pH lowering, the addition of acidic residues is expected to relieve the perturbation and abrogate the consequent antiviral effect. Indeed, confocal microscopic images indicated that pH lowering in endosomes was unaffected by P9-aci-1 (Fig. 6b). In line with the imaging result, P9-aci-1 lost its antiviral activity (IC50 > 100 \u03bcg/ml). In addition, the polykaryon assay further showed that P9 did not directly inhibit HA-cell membrane fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6). Hence, when delivered into the endosomes, virus-bound P9 prevented pH decrease, resulting in the inhibition of viral RNA release and subsequent replication.",

The body weight of all treated and untreated mice began to decrease at day 2 post-challenge and then gradually recovered from day 12 post-infection in the survival mice (Fig. 7e,f). Since we have not established animal models for lethal infection of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, we compared the viral load in mouse lungs at day 3 post-infection in a mouse model of non-lethal SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 7g,h, one dose of P9 for prophylaxis and 5 doses of P9 for therapy significantly inhibited virus infection in mouse lungs compared to that in the untreated mouse lungs (P < 0.05).

It was particularly noteworthy that P9 displayed potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects in mice (Fig. 2). The production of recombinant BDs is hampered by high cost and low recovery rate (Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast, P9 can be chemically synthesized in high yield and with low cost.

We here demonstrated the binding of P9 with viral glycoproteins (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 5), but not the target cells (Fig. 4d). The infection of influenza virus involves multiple steps including virus-receptor binding, endocytosis, transport from early endosomes to late endosomes where acidification results in virus-endosome membrane fusion, subsequent viral disassembly (uncoating), and viral RNA release, which triggers viral RNA replication1222. We demonstrated that P9 might mitigate viral RNA release from late endosomes to inhibit viral RNA replication (Fig. 5). Since pH lowering to 5.0 in late endosomes is critical for virus-endosome membrane fusion2224, inhibitors of endosomal acidification can efficiently inhibit membrane fusion by suppressing the pH decrease in endosomes212225. P9 was indeed capable of inhibiting the pH decrease in endosomes in a similar fashion comparing to two well-characterized inhibitors of endosomal acidification, NH4Cl and Bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 6). Thus, our data suggested that P9 inhibited viral RNA release by suppressing pH decrease in endosomes. The antiviral function of P9 mediated through inhibition of endosomal acidification might be independent of the blocking of M2 ion channel, since P9 could efficiently inhibit the infection of three amantadine-resistance strains of influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (Fig. 7)262728.",

In line with the antiviral mechanism of P9 illustrated in this study, P9 could inhibit infections of other subtypes of influenza A virus including H3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9, as well as two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 7). Our results also demonstrated that P9 could bind to S2 of MERS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the antiviral mechanism of P9 against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was potentially similar to that against influenza virus. We reasoned that P9 might be capable of inhibiting the infection of additional pathogenic viruses, which enter target cells via endocytosis, as long as P9 could efficiently bind to the viral particles.",

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated that a short peptide derived from mBD4 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subtypes of influenza A virus including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9, as well as two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The antiviral effect of P9 is mediated through the following mechanism: (1) P9 efficiently binds to viral particles via viral glycoproteins and (2) P9 is rich in basic amino acids, which prevent acidification in endosomes and inhibit viral RNA release. Influenza A virus and coronavirus have caused several fatal pandemics and outbreaks in the past century. Although a number of anti-influenza drugs have been developed, drug-resistant virus strains emerged quickly after these antiviral drugs were put in clinical use. In addition, thus far, no effective antiviral drugs are available for patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV5. In this regard, antiviral peptides, such as P9, represent new promising prophylactic and therapeutic agents with broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Overall, based on the mechanism illustrated in this study, new antiviral peptides with broad-spectrum antiviral activities may be developed to provide new drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of viral infections.",

Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP was used as the secondary antibody (1:4,000, Invitrogen, 656120). Readings were obtained in an ELISA reader (Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter; PerkinElmer).",
