The virus is characterized by an enormous genetic variability with the existence of two genotypes of PRRSV referred as genotype 1 (European) and 2 (North American), and the emergence of highly virulent isolates in Asia within genotype 2\n[5]. Macrophages in lung and lympoid tissues are the primary site of PRRSV replication\n[6,7], although other cell types such as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and monocyte-derived macrophages are susceptible to infection\n[8,9]. Due to the persistence of PRRSV in infected pigs, it was proposed that the virus modulates host innate and acquired immune responses\n[10,11]. While PRRSV is highly sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 both in vitro\n[12-14] and in vivo\n[15], the virus promotes weakly or not at all in vitro synthesis of type I IFN in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and MoDC\n[16-18]. However, systemic IFN-\u03b1 was observed after infections with various PRRSV isolates\n[15,16,19,20], indicating that certain cell types are able to sense infection.",

            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are a major source of IFN-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines after exposure to TLR7 and TLR9 ligands, including many viruses and bacterial DNA\n[21]. Although pDC are a rare cell type, they can produce around 100 times more IFN-\u03b1 than any other cellular type. They are often able to sense viruses in the absence of viral replication. Consequently, they represent an important candidate cell type for investigating early immune events that could influence early control of virus replication or induction of adaptive antiviral immune response\n[22]. In the pig, these cells have been identified as CD4+CD123+CD135+CD172a+CD14-, which can be differentiated from monocytes, macrophages and MoDC which lack CD4, CD123 and CD135 but express CD14 and in the case of macrophages and monocyte subset also CD163\n[23,24]. Interestingly, stimulation of pDC with genotype 2 PRRSV was reported not to result in detectable IFN-\u03b1 release\n[25]. Moreover, the IFN-\u03b1 production induced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) or transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was potently inhibited by North American PRRSV\n[26]. Considering the observation of in vivo IFN-\u03b1, important differences in the virulence of genotype 1 and genotype 2, and the possible regulation of pDC responses by cytokines induced during PRRS infection, we examined how PRRSV of different genotypes and virulence interact with pDC and how cytokines influence pDC responses.",

Lysates from PAM or MARC-145 cells were used as mock-infected controls. All strains were titrated in their corresponding propagating cell type by CPE evaluation or by using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with PRRSV anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (mAb) SDOW17-A or SR30-A (Rural Technology Inc., South Dakota, USA).

Incubation of CD172a+ cells with LV or its MARC-145 cell-adapted form, LVP23, at an MOI of 0.1 did not elicit reproducible IFN-\u03b1 expression (data not shown), but showed robust IFN-\u03b1 production at an MOI of 1 (Figure \n1B). To further investigate if pDC production of IFN-\u03b1 was a universal response to PRRSV, type 2 strains VR-2332, JA-1262, a virulent recent USA field isolate, SY0608, a highly pathogenic field isolate from China, and the avirulent type 1 Olot/91 strain were incubated with enriched pDC. All isolates directly elicited IFN-\u03b1 secretion by pDC, with type 2 PRRSV prototype VR-2332 displaying the lowest activity, whereas type 1 strain Olot/91 showing the highest average effect (Figure \n1C). Overall, all isolates induced IFN-\u03b1 secretion and the range of IFN-\u03b1 production was independent of genotype or isolate virulence. To assess whether monocytes could be involved in the PRRSV-induced IFN-\u03b1 secretion, we incubated unsorted PBMCs, CD14+, CD14+CD4- and CD14-CD4+ sorted cells with LV, LVP23, and CpG-ODN as a positive control. Whereas no or only low levels of IFN-\u03b1 were found in PBMCs after PRRSV exposure (Figure \n1D), high amounts were detected in the CD14-CD4+ cell fraction (Figure \n1E). No IFN-\u03b1 was detected in CD14+ cells (data not shown) excluding the possibility that monocytes induce IFN-\u03b1 in response to PRRSV. To confirm that pDC were indeed the source of IFN-\u03b1 in enriched CD172a cells, CD4, CD172a and intracellular IFN-\u03b1 staining was performed. It revealed that only a proportion of CD4+ cells among the CD172a+ fraction were IFN-\u03b1 positive after PRRSV or CpG-ODN stimulation whereas no IFN-\u03b1 expressing cells were observed in the CD172+CD4- cells (Figure \n2). Together with the data shown in Figure \n1E, these results demonstrate that CD172a+CD14-CD4+ pDC\n[23] are the source of PRRSV-derived IFN-\u03b1 responses. We also observed a higher percentage of pDC when they were stimulated by PRRSV (4%) compared to mock (1.5%) after 16 h of culture suggesting that PRRSV promotes survival of the pDC. It confirms that PRRSV interacted with pDC and promoted IFN-\u03b1 secretion since the frequency of mock-treated pDC decreased in absence of stimulus.",

In the presence of IFN-\u03b3, pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 secretion was increased with both UV-untreated and UV-treated PRRSV (see also Figure \n4). Considering the central role of TLR7 in sensing RNA viruses by pDC\n[39], we investigated the effects of the specific TLR7 inhibitor IRS661\n[40] to inhibit PRRSV-induced IFN-\u03b1 production. IRS661 is active on porcine cells and inhibits influenza virus-mediated pDC activation compared to a scrambled oligonulceotide\n[37]. We observed that pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 responses were drastically reduced or abrogated by TLR7 inhibition (Figure \n3B), indicating that the TLR7 pathway is intimately involved in pDC sensing of PRRSV.",

As shown in Figure \n4A, LVP23-induced secretion of IFN-\u03b1 was enhanced by IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, whereas strain VR-2332 induced production was enhanced by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 (Figure \n4B).

Furthermore, the prototype type 2 strain VR-2332, although more inhibitory than the genotype 1 viruses tested, was not as inhibitory as previously reported\n[26]. Indeed, porcine pDC respond positively to the presence of viable or inactivated PRRSV by secretion of IFN-\u03b1 in amounts sufficient to protect permissive MoDC from PRRSV infection. Differences in animal age were not important, as we obtained similar results with 6 week-old and 1 year-old blood donors. However, the genetic of the pigs could possibly play a role since differential expression genes, especially IFNA, have been highlighted in phenotypic pig groups in response to PRRSV\n[41]. Another difference compared to the data from Calzada-Nova et al. could be the methodology and cell isolation procedures. Interestingly, the highly pathogenic Chinese isolate was the most suppressive virus tested, pointing to possible strain-dependent differences in the interaction of PRRSV with pDC which should be further investigated with similarly pathogenic viruses. The strain differences in the suppression of IFN-\u03b1 might relate to certain PRRSV proteins that counteract downstream elements of the pathway\n[42].",

Compared to other viruses, including TGEV\n[43,44], influenza virus\n[45], classical swine fever virus (CSFV)\n[46] and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)\n[37,47], tested in our laboratory using the same methodology, the levels of IFN-\u03b1 induced by PRRSV could be classified as moderate. PRRSV is clearly a stronger inducer than CSFV or FMDV, but less potent than TGEV or influenza virus, which reach the same levels as CpG-ODN. The responses observed in vitro are relevant to in vivo conditions, in which systemic IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b1 secreting cells in the lung were reported in several pigs infected with various PRRSV isolates\n[15,16,19,20,48]. Also, Barranco et al. reported increased numbers of non-identified IFN-\u03b1 expressing cells by immunohistochemistry in lymph nodes of animals infected with the Spanish isolate 2982\n[49]. Interestingly, the ability of PRRSV to induce IFN-\u03b1 does not seem to be related to the suppression of TLR9 ligand-induced IFN-\u03b1. The highly pathogenic Chinese strain, SY0608, induced similar levels of IFN-\u03b1 as did LVP23, but was more suppressive for CpG-induced IFN-\u03b1 compared to all strains tested.",

            "text": "Host factors regulating pDC responses may be critical to anti-PRRSV responses, since the presence of different patterns of cytokines could promote an immunological micro-environment favoring or inhibiting pDC responses. For example, in mice Th1-matured pDC stimulated by TLR7 ligand respond more strongly with higher secretion of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1 than do Th2-pDC, but both Th1- and Th2-pDC were more strongly activated compared to unpolarized pDC\n[50]. As we show here in swine, both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 enhance pDC responses to PRRSV. IFN-\u03b2 only enhanced pDC responsiveness to genotype 1 PRRSV; it is not yet known if this is a general feature of type 1 PRRSV or a strain-specific effect. The regulatory cytokine IL-10 was thought to strongly impact PRRSV pathogenesis and was one of the proposed mechanisms used by PRRSV to escape the innate and adaptive immune system. However, the induction of IL-10 by PRRSV is not clearly established\n[11,51], although its presence suppresses type I IFN induction in pDC\n[52,53]. It has been reported that PRRSV could induce IL-4 in the serum\n[20] and IFN-\u03b3 both in the serum\n[54] and in the lungs\n[48] of infected pigs. In particular IFN-\u03b3 could play multiple beneficial roles against PRRSV. It is known to have an antiviral activity against PRRSV\n[55], to generally promote natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell activity and to induce classical macrophages activation with increased anti-microbial functions, antigen-presenting activities and reduced ability to secrete regulatory cytokines such as IL-10\n[56]. As IFN-\u03b1 is known to promote IFN-\u03b3, our data showing that vice versa IFN-\u03b3 also promotes IFN-\u03b1 in pDC, it would appear that stimulating this axis will be beneficial for immunity against PRRSV. IL-4 on the other hand is known to promote the alternative pathway of macrophage activation resulting in \u201cwound-healing\u201d macrophages\n[56], which would be important to repair tissue damage in the lung during PRRSV infection. Through promoting pDC activation by PRRSV, this cytokine would also help establishing an antiviral state.",

This effect may be caused not only by IFN-\u03b1 but also by other type I IFN\u2019s such as IFN-\u03b2, known to be produced by pDC\n[57]. In addition to its antiviral activity, IFN-\u03b1 is an efficient natural adjuvant promoting adaptive immune responses\n[15,58]. For these reasons pDC responses induced by PRRSV are relevant to understanding antiviral immune responses and the pathogenesis of PRRS.",
