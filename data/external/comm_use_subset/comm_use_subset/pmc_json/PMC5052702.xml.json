In this concept, a nucleophilic small-molecule fragment binds to a binding site of a protein (Fig. 1a, step 1). The protein-binding fragment undergoes a reversible ligation reaction with a bis-electrophilic protein-reactive group (warhead)2122 (step 2). The ligation reaction thereby positions the second reactive electrophilic functionality of the warhead at the active site of the protein inducing an irreversible, covalent reaction of the active-site nucleophile with the warhead (step 3) resulting in the irreversible deactivation of the protein. The described reaction sequence enables the testing of combinations of nucleophilic fragments and electrophilic warheads in a biochemical assay and inhibitory fragment combinations detected in this \u2018warhead activation assay' are blueprints for the construction of potent irreversible enzyme inhibitors.",

Coxsackie viruses are members of the large genus of enteroviruses, representing uncoated positive-strand RNA viruses of the picornavirus family and causing numerous human diseases including meningitis, myocarditis and diarrhea25262728. The genus Enterovirus comprises numerous human pathogens, including rhinoviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other human-infecting viruses like EV-A71 and EV-B93 (refs 26, 29, 30). Coxsackie virus 3C protease, like other enteroviral proteases, is a cysteine protease with a characteristic specificity for glutamine in the P1 position of its substrates (Fig. 1b). Thus, for this target, fragments binding to the S1 pocket are biomimetics of the glutamine side chain, while the active-site nucleophile is the thiolate of cysteine 147 (Cys-147).",

For this purpose, a concentration of fragment 1 was determined, which decreased the activity of the protease by \u223c10% over a time period of 10 min. This level of inhibition was used to ascertain the maximal sensitivity of the assay. A small library of 850 primary amine fragments, composed by applying a substructure analysis of the World Drug Index35, was screened in the fragment ligation assay. Fragment 2, 5-amino-1-cycloheptyl-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3-one (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 1), displayed the strongest over-additive effect of inhibition of protease activity. While fragments 1 or 2 alone reduced the enzyme's activity by no more than 10%, the protease was inhibited completely by a combination of 1 and 2 at the same concentrations (Fig. 3b). Incubation of the protease with mixtures of 1 (1.2 equiv.) and 2 (1 equiv.) led to a concentration-dependent deactivation of the enzyme with an apparent IC50 value of ca. 200 \u03bcM and a kinact/KI of 8.3\u00b10.6 M\u22121 s\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Deconvolution of the ESI-MS of the protease after ligation with a mixture of both fragments 1 and 2 showed the modification of the protein mass by addition of both fragments (144+195=339 Da) as the major mass peak (100% intensity, see Fig. 3c). For comparison, the mass peak for the remaining unmodified protein displayed only 12% intensity and that of the protein coupled to the bis-electrophile 1 alone ca. 8%, supporting the assumption that the protein modification was strongly amplified by the presence of fragment 2. Incubation of the mutated protease C147A (ref. 36) did not display any modification in MS, indicating a selective alkylation of the active site.",

Several different addition products of 1 and 2 were formed according to mass analysis and retention times and two of these products had the additive mass of both fragments, which had been observed in the deconvoluted MS of the protein sample reacted with both fragments. This formation of several different addition products of 1 and 2 is in agreement with the reported reactivity of 5-amino-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3-ones, which were found to react with electrophiles at both the exocyclic amino group, the carbonyl oxygen and in the carbon-4 position3738. The product ratio varied strongly depending on the solvent and presence/absence of the protein target. Isolation of the formed ligation products by preparative column chromatography furnished again mixtures of compounds, indicating that they were formed reversibly in an equilibrium reaction. To evaluate the potential of the various ligation products as inhibitors, possible fragment combinations were generated in silico and docked39 into the active site. Docking poses were selected according to their ability to bind and react in a similar manner as observed in PDB entry 3ZZA representing the crystal structure of CV3B 3C protease. In particular, two criteria were applied: (i) the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the lactam moiety of the co-crystallized ligand, and His-161 and Thr-142 in the S1 pocket had to be fulfilled by the docked poses for a plausible position in the binding site and (ii) the distance of cysteine sulfur and the potentially covalently binding electrophile of the ligation product had to be in a reasonable range for subsequent covalent binding (Supplementary Table 2). Docking of fragment 2 suggested that 2 can bind to the S1 pocket of the protease occupying the position of the primary amide of the native glutamine residue (Fig. 3d). Sampling the various reaction paths of the electrophile 1 with the nucleophilic positions of fragment 2 supported the best fit for a nucleophilic attack by the carbon-4 ring position (Fig. 3e). According to our docking experiments, the putative reaction product, a secondary alcohol, can be positioned in the active site of the protein and can be attacked by Cys-147 resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring and the formation of the covalent protein modification (Fig. 3f).",

The approach combines a reversible, dynamic fragment ligation reaction with an irreversible covalent modification and inhibition of the target enzyme, Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease. Starting point for the discovery of protein-binding fragments was the bis-electrophilic warhead, epoxy-aldehyde 1, which combines an electrophilic motif for irreversible inhibition of cysteine proteases, the epoxide, with an aldehyde electrophile for the dynamic ligation of nucleophilic fragments. Warhead 1 alone was only a weak inhibitor of CVB3 3C protease but enabled the sensitive detection of a protein-binding fragment 2, a pyrazolone, from a collection of nucleophilic fragments. Using a FRET-based assay for protease activity, it could be demonstrated that the reversibly formed ligation product of 1 and 2 led to a 3.5-fold enhancement of the protein inactivation rate from 2.4 to 8.3 M\u22121 s\u22121 resulting in the strongly over-additive inhibition of the protease from 10 to 100% inhibition. The templating effect of the protease was confirmed by mass spectrometry showing that inhibition of the protease activity corresponded with shifting the equilibrium to the protein\u2013fragment-warhead complex and thus resulted in the covalent modification of the enzyme's active site.",

In this concept, the protein template binding the initial fragment shifts the ligation equilibrium and thereby induces the protein modification reaction. The method should be principally applicable to other protein surfaces provided that the following three conditions are met: a protein-binding nucleophilic fragment, a bis-electrophile (warhead) that is able to bind to the fragment nucleophile and a nucleophilic protein site that enables the irreversible reaction with the bis-electrophile. Consequently, success of the method with alternative protein targets can be expected, if the bound fragment, the bis-electrophile, and the nucleophilic protein site fit spatially and in terms of their chemical reactivity. It should also be noted, however, as demonstrated in the presented work that initially detected fragment-warhead combinations can be optimized further by chemical modification.",
