This has an immunological explanation. Breastmilk actually contains numerous protective factors such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and lymphocytes, as well as other factors that may contribute to reduce infant mortality in developed countries (25). As a matter of fact, immunoglobulins ingested through breastfeeding confer a direct, timely protection against microorganisms localized in the gastrointestinal tract, which are directly bound by ingested breast milk IgA. On the other hand, in order to protect from infections localized in other body sites, ingested immunoglobulins should be absorbed through the intestinal mucosa and move to other areas through the bloodstream. Nevertheless, evidence shows that the process of intestinal IgA absorption is not effective (37, 38).",

In other words, breastfeeding may represent a proxy for closer contacts of the infant with the mother and, possibly, with other household members. As contact patterns vary in different country settings (42), also the influence of breastfeeding on contact patterns may vary depending on geographic contexts.",
