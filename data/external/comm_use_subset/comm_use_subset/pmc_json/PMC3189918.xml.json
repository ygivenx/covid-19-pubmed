Exosomes bud from endosomal membranes and accumulate in multivesicular bodies, which eventually fuse with the cellular membrane and release the contained vesicles. Exosomes are rich in lipids and membrane proteins like MHC molecules, TNF-R and tetraspanins [5] but their specific composition depends on the cell of origin. Exosomes either fuse to the recipient cell membrane or are engulfed by phagocytic cells in such a way that exosome proteins are degraded and loaded onto MHC class II molecules [7]. Obviously, exosomes can deliver proteins as cargo in a very immunogenic manner so that they efficiently reactivate specific CD4+ T cell clones [8]. Hence, exosomes can induce strong and epitope-specific immune responses [9], [10] and can be used as an alternative to transfer strategies using gene vectors and as promising vaccines [11], [12].",

            "text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin (B-CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the Western hemisphere. B-CLL is considered as a prototypic disease undergoing immune evasion as the malignant cells lack important accessory and co-stimulatory molecules. Thus, despite their expression of high levels of surface MHC class I and II molecules, which presumably present tumor-associated antigenic epitopes, the leukemic cells tend to induce tumor-specific T-cell anergy. Typically, activated T cells from patients show a significantly reduced expression of CD40 ligand (CD154) or are completely CD154-negative [13]. As a consequence, T cells from B-CLL patients cannot activate cells through the CD40 receptor. This interaction, however, is essential for CD40 signaling and subsequent induction of other immune accessory molecules like CD80 and CD86, which increase the antigen-presenting capacity of normal and B-CLL cells. On the other hand, the EBV-specific cellular immunity is relatively intact in these patients [2]. To overcome the dysfunction of potentially tumor-reactive T cells from patients with B-CLL, several approaches have been developed relying on the stimulation of B-CLL cells through the CD40 pathway, including the ectopic expression of CD154 on the leukemic cells, and aiming at the self-stimulation of these cells [14]\u2013[17]. In summary, immunotherapy of B-CLL is promising and CD154 is a potential candidate molecule to improve the patients' immune status and, eventually, the clinical outcome.",

We present a novel approach for the targeted transfer of functional cellular proteins to B cells via tailored gp350+ exosomes. In this approach, gp350 has a dual function: (i) it confers B-cell tropism to exosomes so that they specifically co-transfer proteins of interest and (ii) it is a viral neo-antigen for these cells so that they efficiently reactive gp350-specific T cells. As a proof of concept, we show that tailored gp350+ exosomes can co-transfer functional CD154 as immune accessory molecule to B-CLL cells, which are subsequently stimulated to express surface molecules like CD54, CD80, CD86 and CD95 and stimulate autologous tumor- and EBV-specific T cells.",

We knew from previous work that exosomes can transport ectopically expressed proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is presumably present as a cargo in the exosomal lumen. In addition, several groups provided evidence that surface proteins are incorporated in exosome membranes [5]. We therefore asked whether gp350 could also become an integral part of exosomes and confer B-cell tropism to these vesicles. To answer this question, we co-transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids encoding BLLF1, the gene of gp350, and gfp. Three days later, we isolated vesicles from the supernatants of transfected HEK293 cells as described in Material and Methods and analyzed them by immunoblots for the presence of gp350 and exosome markers. Gp350 was detected in vesicles that floated at a density between 1.03 and 1.08 into an OptiPrep\u2122 gradient, corresponding to a density between 1.13 to 1.18 in a sucrose gradient and thus in the density described for exosomes. The gradient also revealed the co-sedimentation of gp350 with the exosome markers hps70, tsg101 and CD63, indicating the nature of the gp350+ vesicles as exosomes (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry of exosomes coupled to latex beads revealed that gp350 is presumably located within the exosome membrane because it could be targeted with a specific antibody (Figure 1B). To demonstrate that gp350 confers B-cell tropism also to exosomes, we incubated gp350+/gfp+ exosomes with PBMCs from a healthy donor for one day and then quantified exosome binding by measuring GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. This assay revealed that gp350+/gfp+ exosomes had an EBV-like tropism because they bound to CD19+ B cells but not to CD19-negative cells (Figure 1C).",

We then incubated purified CD19+ B cells with these exosomes overnight and used these PBMC as stimulators for an autologous BNRF1-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. As shown in Figure 1D, B cells incubated with BNRF1+/gp350+ exosomes activated the T-cell clone in a concentration-dependent manner whereas B cells incubated with BNRF1+ exosomes did not activate the T-cell clone.

CD154+/gp350\u2013 exosomes were only transferred very inefficiently to B-CLL cells, probably due to an only weak interaction of CD154 with its receptor CD40 on the cell surface. In order to investigate the immune accessory function of CD154, we loaded B-CLL cells from an HLA II DR13+ donor either with 293 exosomes, with exosomes from 293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for gp350 (gp350+ exo) or transfected with expression plasmids for gp350 and CD154 (CD154+/gp350+ exo). One day later, we added HLA-DR13-restricted gp350-specific CD4+ T cells and measured their activation with an IFN-\u03b3 ELISA. This assay demonstrated the relevance of CD154 for T-cell recognition because B-CLL cells loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes were significantly better stimulators than B-CLL cells loaded with gp350+ exosomes (Figure 2D). Induction of the accessory molecule ICAM-1 (CD54), the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), and the death receptor Apo1 (CD95) on B-CLL cells upon incubation with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes (Figure 2E) but not with exosomes from 293 cells provided an explanation for improved recognition by T lymphocytes.",

These experiments implicated that gp350, which is equally transferred to B-CLL cells by CD154+/gp350+ exosomes, can act as a neo-antigen in B-CLL cells, which are normally not infected with EBV [18]. This is a very interesting aspect because B-CLL patients usually maintain a robust and easily recruited CMV- [19] and EBV-specific T-cell response [2] although their T cells in general are functionally impaired. For instance, B-CLL cells infected with EBV or loaded with CMV-peptides are efficiently killed by autologous T lymphocytes from B-CLL patients [18], [20]. We thus aimed at investigating whether gp350 serves as a viral neo-antigen in exosome-treated leukemic cells and whether these cells become targets for gp350-specific autologous T lymphocytes. We stimulated PBMCs from B-CLL patients three times with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes as described above and elucidated the specificities and cytolytic potential of the activated T cells. To this end, we incubated autologous PBMCs for 24 hours with either CD154+/gp350+ exosomes, CD154+/gp350\u2013 exosomes or unmodified 293 exosomes or left them untreated. The next day, these cells were labeled with calcein and used as targets for autologous effector T cells. As shown in Figure 3, T cells generated by stimulation with gp350+/CD154+ exosomes efficiently killed autologous PBMCs that had been activated with CD154+/gp350\u2013 or CD154+/gp350+ exosomes as quantified by the release of calcein. Of interest, we did not observe notable activation of T cells against 293 proteins as PBMCs incubated with exosomes from non-transfected 293 cells were lysed to almost the same extent as non-activated autologous PBMCs.",

Therefore, we tested the cytolytic activity of these T cells against EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs), which are known to be targets for gp350-specific T cells [21], and against EBV-negative B blasts [22] from an HLA-DR13+ matched healthy donor.

One typical experiment is shown in Figure 4: before the first stimulation on day 0, PBMCs of this patient consisted mainly of malignant B cells with only 4% CD3+ T cells. After the third round of stimulation, cultures incubated with gp350+/CD154+ exosomes almost exclusively contained CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (Figure 4A). In total, stimulation with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes yielded approximately 1\u00d7107 vital cells on day 31, meaning that the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts had increased about 25-fold and 15-fold, respectively (Figure 4B), while the total cell number slightly decreased (Figure 4C). In contrast, no viable cells were detectable in those cultures that were treated with CD154\u2013/gp350\u2013 exosomes derived from non-transfected 293 cells, or that were left untreated. Thus, stimulation of T cells with B-CLL cells loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes is a powe rful option to selectively expand specific T cells from B-CLL patients in vitro.\n",

The incorporation of a viral protein as a tumor-specific antigen is straightforward, because the cellular immune system of cancer patients is usually impaired but virus-specific immune responses are detectable even in late-stage patients and T lymphocytes specific for herpes viruses are often present at high numbers [1], [33].

As a result of gp350 incorporation, these particles have a profound B-cell tropism similar to wild-type EBV, so that gp350-carrying vesicles specifically and efficiently bind to B cells. In addition, gp350 serves as a viral neo-antigen in B-CLL cells. We also found that CD154 on exosomes from HEK293 cells is functionally active as demonstrated by the induction of immune accessory molecules on B target cells probably through the CD40 pathway. Taken together, our experiments suggest that leukemia cells treated with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes are efficiently stimulated and subsequently killed by autologous B-CLL and gp350-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes.",

            "text": "In summary, our results demonstrate that modified exosomes carrying the EBV protein gp350 display a distinct tropism to normal and leukemic B cells and efficiently transfer CD154 as a functional protein onto these cells. Leukemic B cells treated with these particles acquire an activated phenotype and become potent stimulators of autologous T lymphocytes. Engineered exosomes can be easily generated and can readily be scaled up for clinical applications. In addition, they can be individually tailored to express additional accessory molecules like OX40L or the Fas ligand or alternative viral molecules to target other classes of cells like macrophages and DCs. The generation of modified exosomes is not limited to 293 cells, which we used in this proof-of-concept. Instead, other cell lines that are approved for human therapy, such as MRC-5 fibroblasts, should also be tested as an optional origin of exosomes to facilitate transition into clinical trials. Modified gp350-carrying exosomes can thus be regarded as powerful and promising tools for various immunotherapeutic approaches.",
