Although no evidence suggests that this virus is transmitted via the airborne route [9], the importance of this route has been suggested by several published reports [10]. In terms of biological plausibility, the potential of airborne transmission of norovirus exists [11], based on the findings of virus-containing aerosol droplets produced by vomiting [12] and toilet flushing [13], the detection of dispersed norovirus in the air [14,15,16], and the successful infection of mice via intranasal instillation [17].

The original investigation concluded that the outbreak was due to airborne transmission because the authors assumed that only the airborne route could have resulted in an attack rate that exhibited an inverse relationship with the distance from the index patient [21]. Here, we demonstrate that with some waiters\u2019 serving pathways and parameter values, a fomite transmission route could produce a similar pattern of secondary cases.",

Therefore, every behavior consisting of a series of touching actions can be regarded as a discrete-time Markov chain, while environmental surfaces and hand surfaces can be regarded as different states in the Markov chain. The surfaces of the mucous membranes are special surfaces so the exposure doses to the mucous membranes were calculated via the surface contamination model.

The re-analysis was undertaken because hindsight and the subsequent investigation of many other outbreaks has called into question the proposed airborne transmission [21] in the absence of support from fluid dynamics analyses. The dispersion of airborne virus-containing aerosols is mainly determined by the airflow pattern in an indoor environment. The high level of complexity of these airflow patterns can be attributed to many factors, such as differences in mechanical ventilation settings. ",

However, in some other outbreaks, such as the first nosocomial MERS outbreak in South Korea [28], fluid dynamics analyses predicted a higher average aerosol concentration in distant wards (i.e., downstream wards) than in adjacent wards. Since the distributions of infections transmitted via airborne routes are mainly decided by the dispersion of airborne aerosols [25,26], it do not necessarily present an inverse relationship with the distance from the source. Thus, to determine the infection patterns attributable to the airborne route, airflow-dynamic studies that model virus-laden aerosols generated by an index patient should be performed where possible [25,26,27,28].",

[18], housekeepers who visited or walked through the emergency room were more likely to become ill than those who did not encounter that area, and patients who visited the emergency room on 11 or 12 November were much more likely to develop infections than those who visited on 8 November.

Lei et al. [39] investigated the relative contributions of norovirus transmission routes in a flight norovirus outbreak, and predicted contributions of 96% and 4% for the fomite and airborne routes, respectively. Therefore, the contribution of the airborne route to norovirus transmission might be negligible when compared with the fomite route, and increased effort should be invested into controlling the transmission of fomite contamination.",

First, detailed information about the ventilation systems and size of the restaurant are not available [21], so fluid dynamics analyses could not be performed. Therefore, the possibility of a long-range airborne route was not evaluated, and its relative importance versus the fomite route could not be accurately determined [27,28]. Second, due to the limited understanding of some of the parameters of norovirus transmission, some parameters in the model, such as the rate of transfer from hands to porous surfaces (Table S2), were estimated from those of other viruses or even bacteria. This might have reduced the accuracy of the results. Third, given the lack of real-time observation data, the model included many assumptions about the common surfaces and the actual behaviors and movements of the guests and waiters (Table S4), which might have affected the infection risk distributions shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1. In general, more detailed outbreak information, laboratory measurements and human behavioral observations would be required to provide a more accurate analysis of norovirus transmission in this outbreak.",

With reasonable assumptions regarding the serving pathways of waiters and parameter values, the findings suggest that the observed spatial attack rate pattern could have resulted from the fomite transmission of norovirus (e.g., Pathway 1). This finding offers an alternative interpretation to the hypothesized airborne transmission route proposed by the original investigators of the outbreak. Furthermore, this study illustrates the need for a careful fluid dynamics analysis when evaluating the possibility of airborne transmission in an outbreak investigation. The results of this alternative transmission route analysis may assist the development of evidence-based infection control measures for norovirus outbreaks.",
