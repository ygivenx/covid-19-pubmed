However, the use of antiviral medications for pre-exposure prophylaxis has a very limited role and is generally not recommended for the majority of the population [10]. Also, NAIs confer only modest decreases in symptom duration for individuals presenting with uncomplicated illness [11\u201313], and this treatment suffers from the selection of resistant strains, adverse effects, and high cost [14\u201316]. While the most effective way to prevent influenza disease and its severe outcomes is by vaccination, current coverage estimates are well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70% [17, 18]. Additionally, vaccine/strain mismatch can result in low vaccine efficacy [19\u201322]. Vaccines may also be contraindicated, unavailable, less effective in immuno-compromised individuals, and suffer from perceived risks leading to \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d [23, 24]. Therefore, the development of effective novel strategies to prevent and treat influenza disease is a significant unmet need.",

For this reason, CPC and other quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly employed in the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections within healthcare settings. Yet there is little evidence demonstrating their effectiveness against respiratory viruses. Here, we evaluated CPC efficacy against the prototypical respiratory influenza virus demonstrating: (1) direct virucidal activity against influenza, (2) rapid activity following exposure, (3) viral ultrastructure disruption, (4) absence of influenza resistance following prolonged exposure, and (5) prevention and treatment of influenza infection in a murine model.",

Moreover, continued exposure to CPC for 90 minutes led to a 90% decrease in influenza titer (Figure 2A). Second, TEM analyses showed that while the viral envelope of untreated influenza viruses was intact, exposure to CPC led to disruption of the envelope and gross distortion of viral ultrastructure (eg cavitation, Figure 3). The presence of negative stain in the interior of virions treated with CPC, but not in untreated virions, suggested permeabilization of the viral membrane. Quantification of the number of intact and disrupted viruses after treatment revealed that 86% (172/200) of the viruses were disrupted or lacked the envelope in CPC-treated samples, while 4.5% (9/200) of untreated virus preparations (in PBS) displayed disrupted or non-enveloped morphologies.",

The reasons for this remain unclear as both influenza A and B derive their envelope from the host cell. However, reports have shown that the phospholipid composition of purified virions differs from that of the host cells. Whereas phosphatidylcholine is the major component in most mammalian cell membranes, in purified virions phosphatidylethanolamine dominates. In addition, analysis of lipid species of the viral envelope revealed subtle differences between influenza A and B strains [39].

However, it is important to note that MDCK cells are quite robust; further cytotoxicity testing of CPC in human-derived cells, such as A549 cells, may add to our understanding of potential toxicity. We expect that longer exposure may also portend increased toxicity. Importantly, CPC has been deemed safe for human use when applied at concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcg/mL [25, 27, 28]. Additionally, extensive safety studies have already been conducted with CPC, including animal pharmacokinetic absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, and reproductive toxicity studies [25, 26, 28]. These studies were conducted in a wide array of animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, cats, and dogs) and humans demonstrating that CPC is safe for human use at the doses used in this study, including the 0.1% w/v clinical formulation.

Importantly, it is likely that CPC would also have substantial activity against other enveloped viruses such as RSV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus. The common annual epidemic of these viral pathogens in addition to influenza highlight the unmet need for broad anti-virals. The potential activity of CPC against non-enveloped pathogens including rhinovirus, bocavirus, or adenovirus remains unclear. However, since CPC has been shown to cause structural damage in non-enveloped bacteriophage [40], this agent may have activity against non-enveloped human viral pathogens as well.

In contrast, QACs, including CPC, have been actively deployed since the 1930s with no apparent reduction in their effectiveness against bacteria and fungi [29]. The reason that resistance to CPC has not been observed is likely attributable to its mechanism of action, which involves binding to the microbial lipid bilayer, and CPC acts against influenza by disrupting the lipid envelope, which is analogous to the activity against bacteria and fungi. Since the viral envelope is host derived, the physicochemical mechanism of CPC is independent of intrinsic viral proteins and unlikely to be influenced by mutation. We have shown that influenza strains had no significant increase in EC50 after 10 passages in the presence of sub-inhibitory CPC concentrations. This lack of resistance potentiation by CPC contrasts with the dramatic development of oseltamivir resistance after as little as 4 to 6 passages under similar conditions [42, 43]. In this regard subtherapeutic oseltamivir exposure can result in > 1000-fold increase in IC50 [43, 44]. However, continued exposure of influenza to CPC beyond 10 passages should be performed to ensure that there is no late development of resistance.",
