The first wave of H5N1 infection ceased after the depopulation of all poultry in Hong Kong, although the H5N1 virus was later found to circulate continuously in Southern China without causing apparent disease symptoms among infected poultry [5]. H5N1 outbreaks recurred in 2003, persistently affecting poultry farms in many Southeast Asia countries, such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. The viruses also spread outside Asia, including to some European countries. More importantly, occasional zoonotic transmissions to humans occurred in most of the affected Asian countries and the virus continued to pose a serious threat to global public health [6].",

The virus rapidly became endemic in Indonesia [9],[10], and continued to cause sporadic zoonotic transmissions to humans beginning in July 2005 [9]. Three clusters of H5N1 transmission among family members were identified in 2005, raising concerns of possible human-to-human transmission of the virus [11],[12].

One of these genotypes, Z, predominated the H5N1 outbreaks throughout 2003\u20132007, causing most H5N1 outbreaks in Asian countries, including Indonesia [16]. Moreover, a variety of antigenically distinct sublineages of Z genotype virus have been established [16]. Unlike Vietnam and Thailand, Indonesia was invaded by only a single sublineage of genotype Z virus. Previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that Hunan province of China may be the source of the initial H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia [17], and classified the Indonesian H5N1 HPAI viruses into three groups [10]; however, further statistical analysis is necessary to characterize and compare different aspects of their evolutionary histories. In this study, we examined molecular phylogeny of the most recent Indonesian H5N1 viruses isolated from avian and mammal hosts. A group of putative reassortant viruses was discovered and their genetic parents were identified. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary behaviors (including spatial migration, growth of genetic diversity, and evolutionary drift and selection) of the reassortant viruses and compare with those of the parental strain, thereby providing insights into the nature and impact of this emerging reassortant strain.",

In all the phylogenies, viruses sampled from avian species during earlier years of outbreaks (predominantly 2003\u20132004) tended to cluster near the root as expected, but with a poorly resolved branching structure that is likely due to relatively low sequence divergence. In contrast, viruses sampled from recent infections (2005\u20132007) from avian and mammalian hosts formed three well-supported lineages with bootstrap support (or posterior probabilities) over 90 (or 0.9) under neighbor-joining (NJ), ML and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) methods. We denote these lineages as groups 1, 2, and 3 in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) phylogenies (Figures 1A and S2C). This structure was preserved in the phylogenies of other genes for which sufficient sequence data were available (viruses from group 3 were missing sequence data for the NP, NS, NS1, NS2, and PB2 genes). The group 3 lineage in the MP, M1, M2, and PB1 phylogenies was only represented by the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain.",

We chose to be conservative, and did not include poorly supported branches (e.g., earlier viruses) in our viral group definition. Therefore, we did not define a group corresponding to the group B of Smith et al., because most of group B taxa are earlier viruses.

In the similarity and bootscan plots (Figure 2B and 2C), the putative reassortants (represented by a consensus sequence) showed a high degree of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering with the group 3 strain A/Indonesia/6/05 in the MP and PB1 segments, but not in other genomic regions, where they were more similar to the consensus sequence of group 2 viruses (Figure 2B and 2C). Moreover, GARD detected two well-supported breakpoints near the boundaries of MP and PB1 segments in the concatenated genomes (Figure 2D), suggesting that the phylogenetic incongruence was significant between the three regions.

Similar groupings were observed in the NA phylogeny (Figures S2C and S4B), although here subgroup R3 clustered with subgroup R1, and two reassortant viruses isolated in 2007 (IDN/CDC1046/07, IDN/CDC1047/07) moved to a different subgroup. These inferred clustering patterns can be explained by multiple reassortment events, or by a single reassortment followed by divergence due to mutation and selection in different populations. We note that some group 2 viruses also cluster inside the reassortant subgroups (Figures 1A and S2C) and may indicate more reassortment events; however, most of them formed polytomies close to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the reassortant subgroups and had poor bootstrap support for their exact placement. As the divergence between the reassortant subgroups and other intercalating group 2 viruses are low, the three subgroups may actually be linked uninterruptedly, implying a single origin. Therefore, the times and number of reassortment events that generated the putative mosaic reassortant viruses remains elusive. We examine both the single and multiple origin hypotheses in subsequent analyses, excluding the intercalating group 2 viruses from the reassortant group.",

Bayes Factors (BF) [20] were used to select among strict and relaxed clock models of evolution [21]. The uncorrelated exponentially-distributed clock model (UCED) significantly outperformed the other models (lnBF>3) for most datasets, except for the NA gene of the reassortant viruses, for which the strict clock model was not rejected (lnBF<1; Table S4). The results of tMRCA estimation are summarized in Figure 3C and 3D. In addition, sequence isolation dates were plotted against their genetic distance (units of substitutions/site) to their MRCA, to graphically show the accumulation of mutations through time (Figure 3A and 3B). The tMRCA of all reassortant viruses (All-tMRCA) was dated to July 2005 (highest probability density, HPD confidence interval: April\u2013October), which is consistent with the linear regression estimate in Figure 3A and 3B. However, the regression estimate of All-tMRCA for the NA gene (April 2005) is slightly older than BMCMC estimate (July 2005). If strains IDN/CDC1046/07 and IDN/CDC1047/07 are excluded from regression analyses then the All-tMRCA date (July 2005; as indicated by the red regression line in Figure 3B) becomes consistent with the BMCMC estimate (July 2005). This suggests that the regression method was sensitive to rate variation caused by the two potential recent reassortants. The tMRCA estimates (R1-tMRCA, R2-tMRCA, and R3-tMRCA) for the individual reassortant subgroups range from May 2005 to April 2006 (Figure 3C and 3D).",

For the reassortant strain, the observed GSC value was not significantly lower than the GSC value expected under panmixis (Slatkin-Maddison test: p>0.2). Therefore the observed geographic structure is not significantly different to that expected by chance alone. For group 2 viruses, the observed GSC value for all geographical state pairs is significantly (p<0.0002) lower than the null value. However, the observed value of GSC within Java (i.e., migrations between Greater Jakarta and the rest of Java) and between the three islands (i.e. migrations between mainland Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua) are insignificantly (p>0.2) and significantly (p<0.0002) lower than the corresponding null values respectively, suggesting that the phylogeny of group 2 viruses is not geographically structured within Java, but is subdivided by island-to-island migrations. However, we could not address whether the viral migrations inside Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua are panmictic or structured due to limited operative localities in our dataset to distinguish between different regions inside these islands. We also found that the migration of group 2 viruses from Greater Jakarta and surroundings to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua was more frequent than expected under the null hypothesis, and there is relatively little viral migration from the rest of Java to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua (Table S3). This observation suggests Greater Jakarta played a more salient role in dispersing group 2 viruses to other Indonesian islands than other parts of Java did.",

For both the HA and NA datasets, the group 2 viruses consistently show a slow growth in relative genetic diversity over time which appears to follow a constant size or exponential growth model, whereas the reassortant viruses initially exhibited an abrupt rise in relative genetic diversity followed by stabilization, which visually resembles a logistic growth curve with two phases [24],[25] (Figure 3E and 3F). When the BSPs are superimposed upon the demographic results obtained under parametric growth models (i.e., constant, exponential and logistic growth; Figure S8), then a similar observation can also be made. However, BF tests (Table S4) indicate there is insufficient statistical power to discriminate between the three parametric growth models (lnBF<2.99), suggesting a lack of strong demographic signal in these data. When the parametric demographic models were fitted to the data, the median estimates of growth rates for the reassortant datasets are generally higher than those estimated for the datasets of group 2 viruses (Table S1).

The Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) method [26] was more conservative and only identified PB2 codon 534 as being positively selected. For the group 2 viruses, HA codon 129 (starting from HA1) and M1 gene codon 205 were the only selected sites identified by the FEL and REL methods, respectively. Using a lineage-specific selection model (see Methods), we identified elevated rates of diversifying selection, measured by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), on the M1 gene in the lineage leading to the MRCA of the group 3 viruses and preceding the emergence of the reassortant viruses (highlighted in Figure 1B). The dN/dS values for the M1 gene in this lineage (which we call the pre-emergence lineage) was estimated to be 1.514 (95% CI: 0.447\u20133.814; see Table S5), significantly higher (LRT p<0.002) than the mean estimates for other lineages (dN/dS = 0.077) in the Indonesian clade and for lineages in other H5N1 HPAI clades (e.g., Fujian, Qinghai, Thailand and Vietnam clades which have dN/dS ranging from 0.05 to 0.09). This lineage-specific elevation of dN/dS was not significant (LRT p>0.1) for other genes (i.e. HA, NA, M2, PB1; see Table S5).

Although the majority of reassortant viruses (24/25) are human isolates, few of the associated human infections are epidemiologically linked (Table 1), suggesting multiple sporadic zoonotic transmissions from birds. The phylogeographic results indicate that the parental viruses of the reassortants have been co-circulating in Java since 2005. Despite the identification of parental lineages, the exact number of reassortment events remains difficult to assess.

This probability might be increased if reassortments confer a selective advantage. We did detect a significantly stronger selection pressure on the M1 protein in the pre-emergence lineage of group 3 parental strain that led to the reassortant viruses (Table S5). Previous reports suggested a few amino acid changes in M1 of influenza A and B viruses can confer a growth advantage in mouse lungs [27]\u2013[29]. Although the M1 mutations identified in this pre-emergence lineage have not been functional characterized elsewhere in the authors' knowledge, one (residue 137, T\u2192A) of them is close to a previously characterized mutation (residue 139, T\u2192A) which controls the virulence in mouse model [27],[29]. Three of the inferred residue changes are located close to the electropositive surface of N-terminal domain of M1 protein (Figure S7) that acts to bind viral RNA [30],[31]. The M1 matrix protein mediates encapsulation of viral RNA-nucleoproteins into membrane envelope during packaging [31], and has close contact with other viral proteins inside the viral particle. It seems possible that some of these changes may be involved in the adaptation of reassortant viruses, through promotion of structural interactions among viral proteins.",

            "text": "According to our analyses, the common ancestor of the reassortant viruses is dated to July 2005 (HPD: April\u2013October), approximately 5 months prior to the first case of human infection caused by the reassortant virus (index case #15 defined by WHO; see Table 1). Our analysis of virus phylogeography suggests the ancestors of these reassortant viruses first arose in Greater Jakarta and surroundings, which agrees with the observation that the first two cases of human infection by the reassortant viruses occurred in Central and East Jakarta (index cases #15 and #16). The molecular dating and phylogenetic analyses suggest that nascent reassortant viruses might take several months to spread and expand their diversity in the local bird population, eventually leading to the exposure of human population. The subsequent spread of the reassortant strain seems to become more rapid and extensive, as human cases were reported outside Greater Jakarta one month later, and the reassortant virus spread to as far as the south and east of West Java in the following six months (Table 1 and Figure 4). Commercial poultry transportation, as well as carriage by migratory birds, may facilitate the viral migration, but their tangible contributions need further studies. Our results suggest that the circulations of reassortant viruses and their genetic parent (group 2) were not restricted by geography within Java. The viral migration back to Greater Jakarta could be driven by the inter-province transfer of infected poultry, in particular the importation of live poultry or fresh poultry products to the densely human populated Jakarta from the remote provinces engaged in poultry-farming. Future studies on economic and social geography (e.g., addressing the modes of inter-provincial poultry transport) in Indonesia might help to further elucidate the effect on the viral dispersal by human, agricultural and industrial activities. In this study, we opted for a lower geographical resolution (i.e., four widely ranged geographical states instead of distinct geographical coordinate for each viral isolate) in our phylogeographic analyses because of the varying precision of the geographical data we have. Therefore, more complex hypotheses of viral origin and migration trajectory cannot be investigated here, but can be explored when more high-quality geographical data of Indonesian H5N1 viral samples is available.",

None of the aforementioned HA mutations which confer recognition to human-type host cell receptors [34],[38] were found in the Indonesian reassortant viruses; however, our detection of positively selected sites in the PB2 gene of the reassortant viruses could potentially reflect adaptation to mammalian hosts, and requires further investigation. In particular, amino acid changes on two positively selected sites (threonine to methionine at reside 76, glutamic acid to glycine and alanine at reside 677) were found on the internal branches of the reassortant lineage, corresponding to molecular changes during sustainable transmissions. However, some of these positively selected changes may also result from the compensatory evolution as the mix of genome segments from different strains might alter their epistatic physiochemistry [39]. Although most of the human isolates in our datasets were epidemiologically unlinked, such linkage is theoretically possible if many asymptotic or mildly manifested human infections are not reported. Recently, some evidence of subclinical or asymptotic H5N1 infection in humans has been put forward [40],[41]; however, the ability of the viruses to transmit from these infected individuals to other susceptible individuals remains unknown.",

Moreover, unusual high mortality of cats in the vicinity of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks has been reported [43]. An unofficial report also detected H5N1 HPAI sero-positivity in around 20% of 500 blood samples taken from stray cats near poultry markets in Java and Sumatera [44]. In addition to small cats in Germany [45], Iran [46], and Indonesia [42], dogs and zoo tigers were also found infected with H5N1 HPAI viruses in Thailand [47],[48]. Furthermore, previous experimental studies have demonstrated that cats can be infected with H5N1 HPAI virus [49],[50], and that cat-to-cat transmission is possible [49],[51]. Could cats, or other non-avian species, have played a role in spreading the reassortant viruses in Java? Similarly, could cats act as amplifying hosts facilitating viral expansion and cross-species transmission, as civets did in the SARS outbreaks [52]? Future experimental studies on these reassortant viruses, that assess viral transmissibility between species, together with epidemiological studies, such as viral monitoring within Indonesian animal populations using serological tests and PCR detection, would give more clues to these questions.",

Areas where more than one lineage of virus is co-circulating, such as Jakarta, are most likely to generate novel viruses by inter-lineage reassortment. These reassortant viruses have distinctive evolutionary and transmission dynamics, as shown in this study. We suggest that more intensive and timely field surveillance and analysis of influenza viruses, including H5N1 HPAI and human H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 epidemic strains, should be employed, so that bio-security can be undertaken promptly and appropriate strains can be selected for vaccine production whenever a novel reassortant strain emerges. The reassortant viruses reported in this study should be also added to the watch list for the future epidemiological surveillance.",

The locations of isolates were indicated on the map of main island of Java in Indonesia (Figure 4). Due to the limit of our geographical data, the localities of the isolates shown in the map (Figure 4) should be regarded as arbitrary within the province which is the highest precision level shared by all viral samples. Each of the reassortant viruses was assigned with a state of either Greater Jakarta (surroundings included) or West Java depending on its place of origin (Table 1). The migratory history of the reassortant viruses (n = 25) between these geographical states were inferred based on the refined ML phylogeny of HA and NA (Figure S4) independently using two parsimony optimization methods, called ACCTRAN (accelerated transformation) and DELTRAN (delayed transformation) implemented in PAUP* software. The geographical states of all ancestral nodes in the tree were estimated to achieve minimum state changes in overall, and therefore the number of state changes and state of the MRCA of the reassortant was obtained. Polytomies were randomly resolved 1,000 times, and state changes were estimated separately for each resolution. The mean number of state changes was then calculated. To test against the null hypothesis of completely unrestricted migration between geographical states (panmixis), the mean number of observed state changes was compared with the frequency distribution of the mean number of expected state changes under the null hypotheses. The null distribution and critical values were generated by randomly shuffling the states of isolates 5,000 times (the Slatkin-Maddison test [22],[24],[64]). The migratory history of group 2 viruses was also studied using the HA gene in a similar manner, while each group 2 virus was assigned to either of four widely ranged geographical states: Greater Jakarta and surroundings, the rest of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi Selatan, including Papua. This assignment scheme is comparable to that of reassortant viruses, as West Java is part of Java.",
