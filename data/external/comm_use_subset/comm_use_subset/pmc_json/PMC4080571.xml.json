Falling short of a stated goal of eradication has a history of engendering the people's loss of confidence in public health, and thus, eradication should be undertaken only with a plan that is likely to succeed. Eradication has been accomplished only for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in ruminant animals. Current programs to eradicate dracunculiasis and polio have excellent chances of success. Measles is also a feasible and worthy target of eradication.",

The discovery of penicillin led to effective treatment of primary and secondary syphilis, the near disappearance of the late effects of syphilis, and in fact, the disappearance of the field of syphilology.

In 1992, more than two decades later, a period during which scores of newly discovered disease agents were identified, the concept of emerging infections was promulgated by a very prominent publication from the Institute of Medicine.11 Our society's members have played important roles in the discovery of many novel, previously unknown pathogens, such as the agents of several viral hemorrhagic fevers.12,13 However, this success has not been a strategic initiative, but rather, it has been more like firemen responding to the call of a house fire. I am certain that emerging infectious diseases will always continue to appear. We should be more proactive programmatically in pursuing research programs for competitive peer-reviewed funding for investigation of unusual undiagnosed syndromes and earlier discovery of the infectious agents. Indeed, we could probe more deeply into nature itself.

Professional identification with the mission of our society, the warm collegiality of annual gatherings, the infusion of cutting edge new knowledge gained from the presentations, and the opportunity to meet personally the leaders in tropical medicine are self-evident advantages. What must become significant outcomes of these annual meetings are more newly established collaborations and newly identified opportunities for exciting productive research. These opportunities include identifying the next career step for trainees and new research partnerships of international members and American and European investigators.",

As Principal Investigator of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Western Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research, I have a program of research that has included tropical disease agents, such as arthropod-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses, Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, Rift Valley fever virus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, Lassa and Junin arenaviruses, Rickettsia prowazekii, Burkholderia pseudomallei, SARS coronavirus, cryptosporidium, Coxiella burnetii, Yersinia pestis, and Brucella melitensis. These efforts have developed candidate vaccines for West Nile, chikungunya, eastern equine encephalitis, and brucellosis that have advanced through non-human primate testing and advanced a Rift Valley fever vaccine. Significant progress has also been made in developing low-cost point-of-care diagnostic devices.",

However, the greatest impact on a disease is prevention. Other than sanitation, the best preventive tool is vaccination, which by nature of the immunizing antigens, is limited in range of disease coverage. I personally believe that vaccines and diagnostics are ripe for successful development. I have been through hard funding times before and intend now to persevere to find a productive pathway to obtain support for vaccine and diagnostics development.",
