During an epidemic, ILI or other forms of surveillance data can be obtained from sources such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FluNet, Distribute Project, etc. Given the availability of surveillance data, we describe the process as follows. First, we build a library of past and simulated epidemics. Simulated epidemics are replicated several times to capture the variability in the system. Using a classification approach, we propose a parameter set to model a new outbreak at time  based on available data up to time t. We use random forest; a supervised tree-based classification method to assign the new epidemic to an existing case in the library. Random forest is efficient on large databases, tends to achieve a high accuracy on most classification problems and enables estimation of importance variables, which is especially useful for data sets with many variables [28]. The efficacy of random forest in classification of partial epidemic curves was illustrated in [29]. If the match suggested by random forest is considered suitable, then the parameters of the epidemic in the library are used in modeling the new outbreak. On the contrary, if none of the epidemics in the library is deemed a good match, then we recursively apply a combination of simulation and optimization methods to propose new parameters.",

However control measures are not presented in this study. This preliminary study is to validate and verify the forecasting method. In this study, we present forecasts for a baseline scenario and focus on epidemics with a single peak.

The attack rate is the cumulative infection incidence observed within a population over the span of an epidemic. If the time of infection is known, the incubation duration can be derived. The infectiousness typically differs for different individuals due to factors such as age, symptoms and health state [6].

(ii) The possible durations of the incubation and infectious periods are fixed as shown in Table 1. We therefore focus on estimating the probabilities of observing each incubation (infectious) duration in the network. (iii) The network is assumed to remain unchanged during the course of the epidemic implying new individuals do not enter or leave the synthetic population. (iv) Biological differences between age groups are not represented. (v) When dealing with a novel epidemic, the prior immunity in the population is assumed to be minimal or null.

This would require adjusting the procedure to account for the uncertainty in the data which is most likely due to unreported cases. Other issues include decisions on how to initialize the epidemic model, how many new cases to introduce into the population during the epidemic and how to model data affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions. Unlike the simulated epidemics where we know the initial number of infected cases, during an epidemic this information is not readily available. One possible means of dealing with these issues involve calibrating the simulated data from the individual-based model to account for missing and unreported data. In addition, an ensemble of different forecasting techniques can be used to improve forecasts made during an outbreak.",

In this study we used only a single optimization algorithm after comparing its performance to two other algorithms. In future studies, we would compare several algorithms to see if a single method is sufficient or whether a combination of different methods would produce better results. Also, the initial sets of parameters are crucial to the performance of the method. If initial selected parameters are similar to the true parameters, then the time to convergence would likely be shorter than if the initial parameters were farther from the true parameters. Furthermore, a study comparing the effects of different objective functions would be beneficial.",
