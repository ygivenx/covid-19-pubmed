In addition, several studies have identified the B-box domain of HMGB1 as important for many of the proinflammatory properties of HMGB1, including cytokine release [8, 9]. HMGB1 is released passively during cellular necrosis by almost all cells which have a nucleus and signals to neighboring cells in the case of ongoing damage [5]. However, HMGB1 also is secreted actively by immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [4, 10, 11]. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was the first receptor demonstrated to bind HMGB1 [12], and HMGB1 signaling through RAGE was found to promote chemotaxis and the production of cytokines in a process that involves the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [13, 14]. Nevertheless, the contribution of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF has not been determined yet.",

The alveolar capillaries were decreased in fibrotic lesions, but increased in nonfibrotic alveolar septa around the fibrotic lesions, where VEGF and IL-8, potent angiogenic factors, were augmented [15]. Since VEGF is also a potent inducer of vascular permeability [16], these capillary dense lesions in nonfibrotic alveolar septa are considered to be leaky, and thus susceptible to the alveolar infiltration triggered by inflammatory mediators in acute lung injury [17]. We are also interested in thrombomodulin, an endothelial anticoagulant cofactor, which is highly expressed in alveolar capillaries in normal control lungs but less so in IPF lungs [15]. This is because the N-terminal domain of thrombomodulin binds HMGB1 so as to prevent its interaction with RAGE and thus suppresses the induction of proinflammatory events [18].",

The surgical biopsies of ten patients with stable IPF, and the autopsied lungs of eight patients with IPF who died after acute exacerbation, were obtained at Tohoku University Hospital. The disease-free lung tissues autopsied from three patients without any chronic lung diseases were also examined as controls. These lung tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and imbedded in paraffin wax. The written informed consent obtained from the patients for using these clinical samples was approved by the ethics committee of Tohoku University. \n",

In brief, black polystyrene microtiter plates (Corning Laboratory Science, Corning, NY) were coated with anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, and blocked by PBS-1% bovine serum albumin for 2 hours. After washing, 100 \u03bcl of 8 dilutions each of the standard and samples, 1 : 1 dilutions in 0.2 mol/L Tris (pH 6.5), 0.15 mol/L NaCl containing 1% BSA were added to the wells and incubated for 24 hours at room temperature. After washing, antihuman HMGB1 peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After another washing step, PS-atto (Lumigen, Southfield, MI) was added, and its luminescence was measured with a 9000D microplate luminescence reader (DIA-IATRON, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrations of 17 cytokines in these BALF samples, consisting of Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), were determined using Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The total TGF-\u03b21 in these BALF samples was also measured using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) produced by MBC Laboratories, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). \n",

In short, the specimen was placed in transport medium composed of Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 0.5% gelatin containing 500 units/ml of penicillin G and 500 mg/ml of streptomycin and was centrifuged at 4,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. The supernatant fraction was inoculated into cultured cells of human embryonic fibroblasts, using the cell lines, HEp-2; Vero; HMV-II, MDCK, LLC-MK2 cells, which can support the growth of numerous viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, mumps virus, measles virus, human coronavirus 229E, and human metapneumovirus. After inoculation, cytopathic effects were examined daily for two weeks, and, furthermore, when no CPE was found, blind passage was performed once for another two weeks with the same system. RT-PCR was also performed for human metapneumovirus virus isolation [22]. \n",

            "text": "The gradual increase of HMGB1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after the onset of acute exacerbation suggests several plausible roles in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF. One of the roles of HMGB1 is as a late mediator of acute exacerbation, because the concentration of HMGB1 was low at the initial onset of acute exacerbation. Although no virulent organisms or viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids examined in this study, all of these patients had flu-like symptoms a few days before the onset of acute exacerbation, which can cause a trigger-like effect of fulminating inflammation similar to acute lung injury. The gradual increase of HMGB1 in the epithelial lining fluids in the lungs after the initial onset of lung injury was also reported in both experimental and clinical acute lung injury [6]. Although HMGB1 can be released by macrophages in response to viral infection [23], the gradual increase of HMGB1 observed in this study is considered to be induced by passive release from necrotic alveolar type II epithelial cells [5] and by active secretion from alveolar macrophages in response to TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IFN\u03b3, and oxidative stress without proved molecular mechanisms [24\u201326]. This is because HMGB1 increased in the absence of virulent virus and because the cytoplasmic staining of HMGB1 was significantly increased in these cells after acute exacerbation.",

            "text": "In contrast to the role promoting severe inflammation, HMGB1 has been reported to promote tissue repair and regeneration [27]. Importantly, HMGB1 induces the migration of stem cells toward inflamed regions to promote repair and regeneration [28]. For example, in smooth muscle cells, HMGB1 induces proliferation and rapid changes in cellular architecture, resulting in cell migration [29, 30]. Interestingly, many of these restorative effects are mediated through the same receptors (e.g., RAGE) that mediate the proinflammatory properties of the molecule [29]. Considering a recent report that the loss of RAGE contributes to pulmonary fibrosis [31], the increase of HMGB1 in alveolar fluids itself may induce fibrogenesis through other HMGB1 receptors, such as the Toll-like family of receptors (TLRs), TLR4, TLR2, or TLR9 [32, 33]. The gradual increase of MCP-1 in positive correlation with HMGB1 in alveolar fluids after acute exacerbation may also contribute to fibroproliferation [34, 35], which is thought to be involved in the regenerative effects of HMGB1. Of course, we cannot deny at this point the plausibility that treatment, including steroid therapy, for these patients in the hospital after the onset of acute exacerbation might affect the gradual increase of HMGB1. In addition, the correlation of the concentration of HMGB1 and/or MCP-1 in BALF with the disease severity of acute exacerbation of IPF has been left for expectations. ",

As we reported previously, even though neutrophils could be origin of HMGB1 in acute lung injury [7], in addition to alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, the concentration of HMGB1 beside capillaries should be elevated. These capillary augmented lesions in IPF patients are susceptible to acute lung injury, not only because these capillaries reduce the ability to antagonize HMGB1 but also because VEGF, which is elevated (augmented) in these lesions [15], loosens the tight junctions of endothelial cells so as to induce leakage [36, 37]. The decreased expression of thrombomodulin, which is an anticoagulant [38] as well, may readily induce coagulation in these capillary augmented lesions, which frequently occurs in cases of acute exacerbation in IPF patients [39].",
