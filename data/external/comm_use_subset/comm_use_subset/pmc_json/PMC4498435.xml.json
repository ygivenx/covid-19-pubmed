At the individual gene level (Figure S3) clustering also indicated an overall association according to geography. As expected the strA and strB genes, normally being genetically linked, clustered together, while clustering of floR and sul1 genes can be explained through the association with class I integrons. The grouping of tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q) and tet(W) is likely due to the general high abundance of these genes across all samples.",

It is well known that changes in diet, microbial intake and antibiotic exposure can rapidly and drastically alter the gut microbiome2021. In addition, several recent studies have shown major differences in gut composition across geography2223242526, probably related to environmental or diet differences. This suggests that the gut microbiome samples from a long-distance flight, to a large extent, reflect the microbiomes acquired at the site of boarding and not a normal \u201cnationally\u201d acquired flora. Strangely enough studies into the changes of the gut composition during travel are scarce, even though it has been indicated that major changes in both the gut composition and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance may occur27 and that foreign travel is a major risk factor for acquisition of selected resistance genes28. Unfortunately no relevant data for comparison to the current study exist, however, in general our observations are in agreement with recent data from WHO6.",

Here we showed the feasibility of collecting and analysing long-distance airplane toilet waste for determining the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance genes and selected human pathogens. In addition to insight into the global macro-transmission of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance, this may also open a novel avenue for simultaneous global surveillance of all infectious agents and quantification of transmission into different countries. Rather than the current surveillance approach where pathogen specific networks are established at laboratories in a limited number of countries, it might be more rapid and cost-efficient with sampling and analysis of the human waste that is transmitted around the World. Such a system is also flexible towards identifying and sampling putative hot-spots and will make it is easier to obtain samples from a new area. A number of obstacles do however, need to be overcome to make this happen. Thus, in order to provide data for action it would be necessary with large scale sequencing facilities close to the sampling site, as well as a global database for real-time exchange of data. The current study included only 18 samples and it would even with the current technologies be a challenge to sequence samples from hundreds of flights on a weekly basis. In addition, more studies are needed to determine how representative the results are of the country of origin. In general airline travel is expanding rapidly and the demographic is not as biased at present compared to years ago. A growing group of people is travelling and they can of-course act as carriers of diseases and antimicrobial resistance genes around the World.",

However, this will still only detect the current presence of infectious agents. Detection of specific antibodies may predict previous or recent presence of infectious agents in a given population. More antibodies are generated and excreted in feces and urine that are produced in the remaining body, which recently have led to the exploration of such samples for diagnosis of diseases3637. In the future this may also be combined with microbial sequencing to provide an even more complete picture of the prevalence and global transmission of diseases.",

At the sites of origin toilets were emptied, rinsed with water and disinfected prior to departure. Idu-Flight was used as disinfection agent, which is a deodorizing liquid, based on glutaraldehyde and benzalkoniumchloride. On arrival to Copenhagen the air flight waste containers were emptied by the SAS Cleaning and Service. For our purpose, one car was designated to empty the airplane waste containers, which were toughly rinsed with water prior to collecting samples. From each of the individual airplanes 6-8 waste toilets were emptied under high vacuum pressure into the special container at the service car. This procedure mixes the content thoroughly and no individual fecal clumps or toilet paper can be visually identified. Three individual \u00bd L samples where then collected using sterile tubes from the cars waste container and placed in a refrigerator. Subsequently, a container was rinsed with water before collecting toilet waste from another airplane. Between one and seven flights were collected during a maximum of 12 hours and immediately transported in closed containers for hazardous goods to the Technical University of Denmark and processed immediately.",

E6070L). Libraries were prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s directions with slight modifications as follows: Following end repair with incubation of 20 minutes at 12 \u00b0C followed by 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C the samples were purified on a Qiagen Minelute silica spin-column following manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Subsequently, the fill-in procedure was performed for 20 minutes at 65 \u00b0C followed by a heat inactivation step for 20 minutes at 80 \u00b0C. Libraries were then used directly for post-library indexing PCR with unique indexing for each sample31.

Initially, trimming and removal of adaptor sequences was done using cutadapt40 with settings for minimum read length being 30 bp and a minimum Phred quality score of 30, to trim low-quality reads before adaptor removal (cutadapt parameter - quality-cutoff). Subsequently reads were processed through a mapping approach build on bwa mem41 and samtools42 software. Bwa mem (ver. 0.7.7-r441) was used with default settings to map reads against reference sequence databases. Throughout the mapping approach, only the most reliable hits were accepted i.e. properly paired reads were accepted provided that each read maps with an alignment length being at least 80% of the read length. As part of the initial cleaning process, potential PhiX i.e. PhiX174 control reads were removed using the procedure described above and all remaining reads are likely to have a biological origin. The read statistics for the pre-processing steps are shown in Table S1 for each of the 18 samples available. Next, reads were mapped to a number of reference sequence databases following one of two possible routes, being either chainmode or fullmode mapping. A flowchart of the two mapping procedures is shown in Figure S4. All samples were mapped against the databases that can be created from public available reference sequences. In Fullmode a resistance gene database (ResFinder) was used. In Chainmode the follow ordered list of databases were used: MetaHitAssembly, Bacteria, Plasmid, Human, Invertebrates, Protozoa and Virus. Reads that mapped to the Bacteria database were subsequently used to extract hits of pathogen specific origin. Three pathogens with the highest read counts were considered as shown in Table S6 (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104, Clostridium difficile R20291, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni IA3902). In this table we only show the most confidently mapped reads and referee to them as unique meaning those where the bwa flags \u2018AS\u2019 and \u2018XS\u2019 differ.

Pellet was resuspended in 0.75 ml PBS and the suspension was clarified by chloroform/butanol extraction (1:1 vol/vol), during which the mixture was vortexed for 30 sec followed by 5 min storage at room temperature before centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 G for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Quantification of NoV GI and GII genome copies was done by interpolation to standard curves derived from NoV GI.3b and GII.1 RNA transcripts. Inhibition of amplification during RT-PCR detection of NoV GI and GII was evaluated by adding GI.3b and GII.1 transcripts, respectively, as internal amplification controls to each sample RNA extract and to nucleic acid-free water. The amplification efficiency was calculated by dividing the RNA transcripts recovered from the sample RNA by the RNA transcripts recovered from the nucleic acid-free water and was accepted for values above 50%. The extraction efficiency of viral nucleic acid was evaluated in all samples using Mengovirus, strain vMC0 (ATCC VR-1597) as internal process control.
