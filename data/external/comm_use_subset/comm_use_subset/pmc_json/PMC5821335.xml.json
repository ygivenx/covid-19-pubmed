Gastroenteritis induced by RV is the foremost etiological agent of acute pediatric viral diarrhea worldwide which was a leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age [1]. A recent study indicated that, in total, 127,539 and 53,559 deaths from diarrhea and RV infection respectively, were reported among children younger than 5 years old in China [2]. RV epidemics are associated with the seasons [3, 4], the sanitary conditions of regions, the conditions people live in, and individual hygiene. RV transmission is mostly by fecal-oral spread in the case of direct and indirect contact [5, 6]. It also can infect many animals, such as calves [7], piglets [8], foals [9], dogs [10], mice, guinea-pigs, sheep, goats, antelopes, monkeys, deer, rabbits and cats [11]. Regardless of two epidemics of severe diarrhea near Lanzhou and Jinzhou in late 1982 and early 1983 [12], RV is a hazard to human [13] and other animals all the time in China.",

TNF-\u03b1, a proinflammatory cytokine, could cause damage to the body by inducing inflammation [50]. The lower TNF-\u03b1 level could protect the organism from inflammatory injury. Our study showed that the TNF-\u03b1 concentration decreased gradually with the increase of RDS concentration (Fig 2).

The immune response of children who developed persistent diarrhea following RV infection established that the concentrations of plasma IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 were higher in children with diarrhea compared to uninfected ones [51]. Another previous study showed that cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-10, played a key role in RV infection and protection against RV disease in children [52]. The levels of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were also elevated in gnotobiotic pigs after infection with virulent or attenuated human rotavirus [53]. However, there were no significant differences between the RDS groups and the RVC group on IL-4 and IL-10 levels in this study, proving that the anti-RV effect of resveratrol could not attribute to elevating IL-4 or IL-10 production.",

It is reported that resveratrol supplement increased the amount of CD4+ in rat [57] and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in chicken [58]. Previous study has declared that the CD4+/CD8+ showed a strong correlation with CD8+ count, but not with CD4+ count [59]. Another study [60] described that CD4+ T cells have an important role in the generation of rotavirus-specific intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is the principal effector of long-term protection against rotavirus infection, and CD8+ T cells have a role in the timely resolution of primary infection. Therefore, we inferred that the higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio could also play an important role in clearance of RV.",
