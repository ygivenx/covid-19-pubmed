            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV), a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is responsible for a highly contagious respiratory illness that affects millions of people worldwide during seasonal epidemics causing huge mortality and economic loss [1, 2]. H1N1 and H3N2 are the presently circulating virus subtypes that cause yearly epidemics in humans. The receptor-binding surface molecule haemagglutinin (HA) forms homotrimers [3]. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule HA0 and proteolytically processed into the subunits HA1 and HA2 that are connected by a disulfide bond. Activation of HA is important for its fusion potential with the endosome including a conformational change to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm (reviewed in [4\u20137]). Depending on the protease recognition motif, several proteases have been identified to cleave HA (reviewed in [5\u20138]). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to cleave H1- and monobasic H7-HA in vitro at the cleavage sites PSIQSR\u2193G and PEIPKR\u2193G, respectively [4, 9]. Furthermore, in mouse knock-out (KO) mutants, it was shown that Tmprss2-deficient (Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212) mice are highly resistant to infections with H1N1 and monobasic H7N9, but only weakly to H3N2 [10\u201312]. In resistant Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice, H1- and H7-HA are not efficiently cleaved and subsequently the virus fails to spread in infected lungs and therefore does not cause pathology [10\u201312]. On the other hand, H3N2 is able to replicate in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice and cause mortality [10, 13]. In Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 Tmprss4\u2212/\u2212 double KO mice, replication of H3N2 is still occurring although at a strongly reduced level resulting in low mortality [14]. Thus, the H3-HA motif PEKQTR\u2193G is not only processed by TMPRSS2, but also by TMPRSS4 and at least one more, yet unknown protease [14].",

For this, we generated several reassortants and mutant viruses based on A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (HK). Plasmids were generated by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 to rescue viruses. We first generated two reassorted viruses, HK_HA(PR8) carrying the entire HA segment of H1 on the backbone of HK, and PR8_HA(HK) carrying the entire HA segment of H3 on the backbone of PR8 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we generated a recombinant virus [PR8_HA(MVEKT)] in which we replaced the HA cleavage site and neighbouring amino acids of H1-HA with the amino acid sequence of H3-HA (region from amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA1, Fig. 1). We refer to this HA region as the \u2018HA-loop\u2019 which is predicted to interact with cellular proteases and in which HA cleavage occurs between amino acids R329 and G330 (Fig. 1). Additionally, we produced a virus in which we also exchanged a more distant amino acid from the H1-HA to the H3-HA sequence that is predicted to interact with amino acids in the loop (see below for more details) either by itself or in combination with the loop exchange. In these viruses, referred to as PR8_HA(D) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), respectively, the glutamate at position 31 was replaced by aspartate from H3 (E31 to D31, Fig. 1). Of note, we could not rescue recombinant virus with single amino acid exchange in the H1-HA-loop (predicted protease recognition sequence: H1-PSIQSR to H3-PEKQTR) suggesting that the entire H1-HA-loop or H3-HA-loop sequence is required for a functional HA. The replaced and mutated HA segments (segment 4) were incorporated into viruses with an isogenic PR8 backbone for all other segments (Fig. 1).",

After infection with PR8 (H1N1), WT mice lost body weight and all infected mice died, whereas Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice lost body weight only slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 2a). Infection with HK_HA(PR8) resulted in body weight loss in WT similar to infections with PR8 whereas Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a similar resistance phenotype as for infections with PR8 (Fig. 2b). These results demonstrate that the resistance phenotype to H1N1 virus in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice resides in the H1-HA segment and that other proteins of the HK virus do not have a major impact. Infection of Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice with PR8_HA(HK) led to body weight loss in both mouse strains and death of all infected mice (Fig. 2c). These results are consistent with our previous observations using the entire HK (H3N2) virus [10]. Also, results with the reassorted viruses HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK) were identical to the results from the parental viruses (PR8, HK) in previous studies when the same infection dose was used (2\u00d7103 f.f.u.; Fig. S1, available in the online version of this article). Together, our results demonstrate that exchange of the HA segments leads to a phenotype that resembles that of the parental virus (H1N1 or H3N2, respectively) in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. Thus, H3-HA is necessary and sufficient for body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Infection of WT mice showed that PR8_HA(MVEKT) was not as pathogenic as the parental PR8 virus; only 50 % of the infected WT mice died after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) compared to 100 % lethality of WT mice after infection with PR8 or PR8_HA(HK) (Fig. 3a). More importantly, after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) virus, Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice only lost body weight slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 3a). These results demonstrate that the exchange of the HA-loop alone from H1-HA to H3-HA is not sufficient to cause strong body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that additional amino acids outside the HA-loop region are required for this phenotype.",

This resulted in virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (Fig. 1). Of note, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) could only be rescued after exchange of the codon GAG (encoding for glutamic acid, nucleotide 144\u2013146) to GAU, but not GAC (both encoding for aspartic acid) which might be due to a restriction in the cis-acting specific packaging signal [17]. After infection with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed strong body weight loss with a similar kinetic as WT mice (Fig. 3b). Also, all of the infected WT mice and 40 % of infected Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice died (Fig. 3b). Thus, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) is able to cause considerable body weight loss and mortality also in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice although to a lesser extent. We confirmed that both exchanges are required for the higher pathogenicity of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) by studying the pathogenicity of the single mutant PR8_HA(D) virus (Figs 1 and S2). This virus exhibits slightly higher pathogenicity (body weight loss similar, one mouse died) in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice than PR8 but was much less virulent than PR8_HA(D-MVEKT).",

WT and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with 2\u00d7105 f.f.u. PR8, PR8_HA(HK), PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). On day 2 and 4 p.i., viral loads were determined in infected lungs (Fig. 5). ANOVA of the viral load as the response variable revealed significant effects of virus-type and mouse-strain as well as their interaction. Pair-wise comparisons showed that viral loads were significantly higher in WT compared to Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice after infection with PR8 and PR8_HA(MVEKT) at 2 and 4 days p.i. demonstrating that viral replication is strongly reduced in the absence of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed between WT and KO mice after infection with PR8_HA(HK) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) on day 2 suggesting that replacement of the HA-loop plus a distant amino acid allows efficient replication of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5). At day 4 after infection with HK_HA(PR8) the viral load was lower than at day 2, but still the same for WT and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 (Fig. 5). In contrast to this observation, the viral load of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) at 4 days p.i. was lower in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to the WT. This is in agreement with the higher survival rate of Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additionally, viral replication was significantly higher in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) compared to infections with PR8_HA(MVEKT) or PR8 at day 2 and 4 (Fig. 5). Thus, the difference in virus virulence (body weight loss and mortality) between PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and PR8_HA(MVEKT) can be explained by differences in viral replication in infected lungs and thus increased tissue damage.",

In line with our previous results, HA of PR8 was cleaved in WT mice, but only slightly in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 8a). The difference to previously published data is most likely due to a higher infection dose used in this study [10]. Out of three blots of the same lung samples, the ratio between HA1 to HA1+HA0 was calculated and the mean depicted (Fig. 8c). After infection with PR8, 22 % of HA was cleaved in WT mice, but only 7  % in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice. As described above, HA of HK was cleaved in WT (31 %) and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice (15  %) (Fig. 8b). Likewise, the HA of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) was cleaved in both WT (19  %) and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice (14  %), which correlates with its high replication rate and pathogenicity (Fig. 8a).

A third study described an H3N2 variant that was not able to replicate in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice [11]. However, after serial passages in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice, this virus acquired a mutation in the HA stalk which led to replication and pathology in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice [13]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 Tmprss4\u2212/\u2212 double knock-out mice, replication and pathology after infection with our H3N2 isolate was strongly diminished and infected mice survived. These observations suggest that H3 viruses are able to replicate in a Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 background whereas H1 viruses cannot. Here, we investigated in detail the differences in the HA sequence that are responsible for the different behaviour of H1 and H3 viruses in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice. For this, we generated a series of reassorted and mutated IAV and analysed body weight loss, survival, viral replication in lung, lung epithelial cell damage, and cleavage of the HA protein in WT and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

However, replacement of the HA-loop and additional replacement of a distant amino acid, E31 by aspartic acid from H3-HA, strongly increased mortality of Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice after infection [virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. The increase in pathology was due to a higher viral replication and increased lung epithelial damage which was comparable to WT mice infected with this virus. E31 is predicted to interact with R321 of the HA-loop in H1-HA. The exchange of E31 and accompanied changes of the HA protease recognition site could lead to an altered accessibility of the HA-loop for other proteases than TMPRSS2 in [PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. Several in vitro studies also suggested that the exchange of the HA-loop itself does not necessarily lead to productive HA processed by matriptase protease [18]. Furthermore, when the cleavage site of an H1-HA was exchanged by the amino acid sequence RSSR, matriptase was still unable to cleave the HA-loop. Similarly, an H9-HA carrying the minimal furin cleavage motif was not cleaved by furin [19]. Further studies are thus needed to address the role of additional proteases and requirements for a fully functional HA processing. The importance of a distant amino acid on the pathogenicity of an H3 virus had been shown before by exchanging amino acid 8 in HA resulting in the loss of a glycosylation site and increased pathogenicity [13, 20]. In addition, it was shown that cleavage by TMPRSS2 results in a less glycosylated HA1 compared to cleavage by trypsin or TMPRSS4 [8]. Thus, our in vivo study confirms previous in vitro analyses demonstrating the role of loop and distant amino acids for viral replication.",

Thus, our main conclusions relate to the difference of virus pathogenicity and replication between WT and Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice.

In other studies, the degree of the inflammatory response and the resulting immunopathology has also been described as a major contributor to disease severity [21, 23]. In this study, histopathological analysis showed that tissue damage was the major correlate for disease severity. It also correlated well with replication (between WT and mutant mice for a given virus) whereas tissue inflammation was not significantly correlated. We thus hypothesize that virus replication and subsequent tissue damage is the main cause for disease severity. This conclusion is well in line with the interpretation that the absence or presence of specific proteases is the main driver for virus maturation, and subsequently its replication and spread in the infected lung and eventually severity of the disease. A similar result was obtained from patients infected with pandemic 2009 H1N1 or H7N9. Patients whose genome carried a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2 were more severely ill than patients expressing less TMPRSS2 [24].",

However, Western blot analysis revealed that the HA-loop of both viruses, PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), was cleaved in Tmprss2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Nevertheless, PR8_HA(MVEKT) was less efficiently cleaved compared to PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). One likely explanation could be that PR8_HA(MVEKT) is cleaved by a protease that recognizes the HA protein at a nearby but markedly different cleavage site than the trypsin-like TMPRSS2. Such a shift by a single or three amino acids is sufficient to cause cleavage but would thus not result in efficiently activated particles as has been reported for cleavage of H3-HA by thermolysin and chymotrypsin [25, 26]. A second possibility could be that the respective unknown protease cleaves at the same site as TMPRSS2 but does not generate activated particles, as has been described for hepsin [8]. In both cases, these viruses would not be infectious and do not lead to high titres, tissue damage and death of the animals although the HA protein is cleaved.",

Another candidate may be TMPRSS11D (HAT), which was shown in vitro to cleave H3-HA [27, 28]. Additionally, it was described that H3 can be cleaved in vitro by kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5), tryptase Clara (TPSB2), TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) [6, 29, 30]. For these studies, additional mouse mutants with single and double KO will be required. Recently, a Klk5-deficient knock-out mouse was described that showed no difference in body weight loss compared to WT mice after infection with a H3N2 IAV supporting again the hypothesis that more than one protease is responsible for cleavage of H3-HA [31]. To identify the third protease that cleaves H3-HA in vivo, additional mouse mutants with single, double or even triple KO will be required.",
