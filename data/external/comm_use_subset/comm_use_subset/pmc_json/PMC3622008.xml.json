Two waves of infection followed, accounting for an estimated 61 million cases, 274,000 hospitalizations, and 12,470 deaths [2], [3]. Compared to seasonal averages, there was an increase in hospitalizations and a decrease in mortality. Children experienced a greater burden of disease and a disproportionately increased burden of mortality [4]\u2013[10]. However, the majority of children did not progress to severe disease [11]. In contrast, fewer adults were afflicted but proportionally more experienced severe disease [12]. The clinical characteristics of pH1N1-infected individuals are well described [13]\u2013[22].",

Co-infection occurs in 25\u201340% of children with bronchiolitis [23]\u2013[26]. Viral co-infection also increases the likelihood of requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) level of care [27]. These findings may reflect certain combinations of co-infection. For example, infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus is associated with a 10-fold greater likelihood of PICU level of care [28]. Although some studies revealed similar findings with RSV and rhinovirus co-infection [29]\u2013[31], others have not confirmed this finding [32]\u2013[37] or have found less severe disease with viral co-infection [38], [39]. In adults the clinical significance of co-infection is poorly understood. It accounts for approximately 5% (range 2%\u201316%) [40]\u2013[42] of adult viral acute respiratory infections, with varying prevalence of specific pairs of viruses [43]\u2013[47]. Co-infection during the 2009\u20132010 pH1N1 season varied as well [42], [48]. One study found pH1N1 co-infection with rhinovirus correlated with a lower clinical severity, whereas pH1N1 co-infection with other viruses led to greater severity [48].",

Several continuous outcome variables (duration of symptoms pre-admission, length of intensive care unit [ICU] stay, length of hospital stay, WBC, and percent bands) were also not normally distributed and a natural log transformation was also used to normalize these variables before analysis. Logistic regression, adjusting for age, was used to examine all categorical outcomes, with results reported based on Wald tests with associated odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for age, was used to examine all continuous variables. ANCOVA results report the covariate-adjusted F-test p-values and the adjusted outcome means with their standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. All adjusted natural log transformed outcome variables were transformed back into their original metric in tabled values. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 20.",

PH1N1 co-infected patients were more likely to present with interstitial opacities consistent with a viral pneumonia and they were more likely to received treatment for a presumed secondary bacterial pneumonia. However, there were no differences in admission to any ICU, ICU length of stay, or duration of hospitalization. These findings appear incongruent, as other authors have described an association between pH1N1 mono-infection and secondary bacterial pneumonia, which in turn is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [14], [19], [42], [47], [49], [66]\u2013[73]. We used the treatment for a bacterial pneumonia as a surrogate marker for this complication. Only a third of patients treated for a bacterial pneumonia had respiratory specimens submitted. Thus, our ability to microbiologically confirm this diagnosis was limited.

Exceeding these bounds, pH1N1, as compared to seasonal influenza, demonstrates an accentuated pro-inflammatory response, but also a suppressed adaptive immune cytokine response [87]\u2013[91]. The pathogenesis of dual respiratory viral infections is unclear. Esper et al found co-infection with pH1N1 and rhinovirus correlated with lower clinical severity, whereas other pH1N1 virus pairs had greater severity, independent of pH1N1 titers [48]. Elsewhere, co-infection with RSV and another virus was associated with a decreased IFN-gamma response and ultimately increased severity [31]. Further research into the host cytokine and cellular responses of co-infected patients are needed, as are studies with a more robust microbiologic assessment to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia.",
