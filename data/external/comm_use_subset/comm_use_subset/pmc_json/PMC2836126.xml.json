The treatment for the various DNA organisms is very specific and would be possible only if the causative organisms were promptly identified. All of the described RNA viruses except for dengue are highly infectious by aerosol transmission and no specific treatment has been demonstrated as safe and effective for the hemorrhagic fevers [7]. The rapid screening of suspected samples would help control the spread and ensure accurate treatment of the diseases. Current available diagnostic tests for CDC category \u201cA\u201d bioterrorism agents (e.g., cell culture, serology) are time consuming, have less than optimal sensitivity and specificity or cannot test for multiple agents simultaneously [9\u201312]. Newer molecular methods are either singleplex real-time PCR assays that are not available outside the CDCs LRN network or small commercial multiplex PCR assays that are linked to expensive machines (and also not easily available) [13,14]. There is a need for precise, rapid, simple and robust diagnostic assays to detect a large number of these agents for both clinical treatment and to prevent panic among the public and authorities.",

Using the standard assay protocol to re-probe any positive (\u223c30 minute procedure) it was found to be a true negative. This was most likely a technical error. However, even counting it as a false positive would not have much of an impact on the specificity for VZV which was 99.8% (95%CI 99\u2013100). One sample tested very low positive for VM (OD=0.434) in the BA pX01 spiked samples. Re-probing of the PCR product continued to show the sample to be positive. However, retesting the original clinical sample demonstrated it to be negative. Therefore, this represented a true false positive (1/400 samples). Specificity for VM was 99.8% (95% CI 99\u2013100). No other false positives where detected using the FT, BA pX01, BA pX02, and YP probes (specificities 100% (95% CI 99\u2013100).

Plasmid pX02 (60 MDa) carries the genes required for synthesis of an antiphagocytic poly-D-glutamic acid capsule facilitating host immune system evasion [20\u201325]. The 110-MDa plasmid pX01 is required for synthesis of the three anthrax toxin proteins, edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA). These proteins act in binary combinations to produce the two anthrax toxins: edema toxin (PA and EF) and lethal toxin (PA and LF) [26]. Isolates lacking either the pX01 or pX02 plasmid are considered either avirulent or significantly attenuated [27,28]. In the present study, 2 sets of primers and probes were designed from the conserved regions of the PA and Cap gene located respectively on the plasmids pX01 and pX02 for B. anthracis. Only clinical samples that give positive signals for both primers and probe sets will be considered \u201cpositive\u201d for BA. Since we demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for both the pX01 and the pX02 primer and probe sets, our assay should work well for detecting both targets in BA.",

Real-time PCR and micro-array are currently two of the most commonly reported molecular diagnostic methods. MGB probe-based real-time PCR assays were developed for detecting Y. pestis, F. tularensis and B. anthracis simultaneously [29]. For this test the sample must be tested simultaneously with a seperate singleplex assay for each of these three targets. Two commercial triplex (multiplex) real time PCR kits and machines were developed by Cepheid [13] and Idaho Technology, Inc. [14] to detect B. anthracis, Y. pestis and F tularensis, however, their assays can only be used on their machines. Therefore, laboratories with standard thermocyclers or real-time machines cannot run these assays. We were unable to purchase reagents for comparison testing. For viral hemorrhagic fever agents, several TaqMan or SYBR green real-time one-step RT-PCR assays have been developed for detecting and serotyping dengue [30\u201332]. A single-tube multiplex PCR was developed to identify the serotype of dengue virus which had been previously screened by real-time PCR [33]. The detection for Ebola virus, RVF and Lassa is still dependent on serology testing in most laboratories but additional RT-PCR methods have been recently developed. A German group established 6 one-step, real-time RT-PCR assays for Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), dengue virus (DENV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) [34]. These assays cannot distinguish all the targets simultaneously.",

These robotic systems can dramatically increase throughput and decrease hands-on time. We recently demonstrated dramatic decreases in technician time (by half) using automated extraction and both EHA detection and automated microarray detection [40]. However, automation can have hidden variables that effect costs, sensitivity and reproducibility. The chemistry of each assay, including buffers and enzymes used, and especially the target (RNA vs. DNA and size) and clinical matrix can affect the results you obtain with some of the automated systems. We demonstrated with the BioT DNA assay that the sensitivity using Roche\u2019s High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit for extraction was one log better than using the Roche MagNAPure Compact system which also had less consistent reproducibility (data not shown). Ultimately, the goal of our laboratory is to develop fully contained, automated, hands-off devices that can extract nucleic acid, amplify a target, and detect it while being fast, accurate and inexpensive. This technology must be robust and flexible to different targets and matrix material (transport medium and clinical material). Medium to large multiplex assays as described in this paper are steps in this direction.",

To determine the approximate copy number of plasmid controls and synthetic RNA controls, the absorbance value of the positive control (A260) was used in combination with Avogadro\u2019s Number (6.022 \u00d7 1023) as described by Khanna et al. (2005) [41]. The RNA transcripts were diluted in RNase and DNase free water with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), frozen at \u221280\u00b0C in 30 \u03bcL aliquots. Serial dilutions of the plasmids and RNA transcripts were used to establish the analytical sensitivity and specificity of BioT DNA and RNA multiplex assays.",
