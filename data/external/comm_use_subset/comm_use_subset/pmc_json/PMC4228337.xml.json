Recently, the rise of sequencing and other technologies have meant that disease transmission can be studied at the molecular level. One example of molecular epidemiology is the reconstruction of transmission trees based on the genetic relatedness of pathogens, which reflect the relationships between infected individuals [1].",

However patients sharing similar viruses are potentially epidemiologically linked, so local outbreaks within the larger epidemic can be identified by finding transmission clusters. Clusters in epidemiology are broadly described as an unusual aggregation of infection, perceived to be greater than that expected by chance. In networks, clusters are quantitatively defined as a group of nodes having a local clustering coefficient significantly greater than that of a random graph with the same number of vertices and the same mean shortest path [11]. In a phylogenetic tree, clusters contain sequences from different patients which share a recent common ancestor. These clusters are manifest as groupings in the phylogenetic tree in which we have high confidence and which are likely to reflect recent or ongoing transmission. However, defining and detecting meaningful transmission clusters from a population sample in a phylogenetic tree is not straightforward, and various strategies have been proposed and used in the literature.",

For HIV, bootstraps ranging from 70% and up to 99% have been used [5,12-16], in combination with within-cluster genetic distances from 1% to 4.5% substitutions per site [3,13-15,17,18]. The method for calculating within cluster genetic distance also varies: the mean of the pairwise genetic distances of clustered sequences has been employed [16], as well as their median [19]. Another alternative is \u201csingle linkage\u201d, where a sequence is included in a cluster if its distance to just one other sequence in the cluster is below the threshold [20,21]. If time resolved trees are used (which require knowledge or inference of a molecular clock), clusters can be defined based on time to most recent common ancestor [22]. These most resemble clusters generated using maximum genetic distance in a non-time resolved distance-based tree.",

Using in-house pipe lines for detecting clusters is possible, but in order to compare results between studies, freely available software tools would be advantageous. Based on the support and genetic distance criteria commonly used, we have developed the Cluster Picker (CP) which identifies clusters in phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, we introduce the Cluster Matcher (CM), the first tool to describe identified clusters epidemiologically as well match clusters between phylogenetic trees. To demonstrate their utility, we use both these tools to examine subtype B cluster dynamics in the UK and we compare CP performance to that of other available software.",

The user inputs an initial node support threshold, and starting from the root, the tree is divided into subtrees supported at this threshold. Further analyses will take place only within these subtrees; therefore, the initial support threshold must necessarily be smaller than or equal to the cluster support threshold. Starting from the root of the subtree, the CP proceeds to the first node exceeding the bootstrap support threshold. All sequences within the group are identified and their pairwise genetic distances are calculated. If the largest of these is smaller than or equal to the user-input maximum genetic distance threshold, the group of sequences is identified as a cluster. If the maximum pairwise distance is larger than the threshold, the cluster is rejected and the algorithm proceeds to the next supported node and repeats the same analysis. When a leaf is reached, the CP backtracks to the last node whose children have not been fully analyzed. When the algorithm has analyzed the entire tree, a list of clusters matching the user-input criteria is generated. Note that because the algorithm proceeds from the root towards the tips, nested clusters are not identified and do not appear in the final list.",

Initially, we fixed the bootstrap threshold in the CP at 90% and varied within-cluster maximum genetic distance between 1.5% and 7.5%. Between 4.5% and 7.5%, we found that for the most part, the same clusters were identified (Figure 1A). Within this range, the number of clusters stabilized around 128 (ranging from 126 to 131), with 2/3 containing only two sequences. At a genetic distance of 1.5%, only 63 clusters were identified. The proportion of sequences in clusters and average cluster size both increased as the genetic distance threshold was increased (Figure 2A). At a maximum genetic distance of 4.5%, 25% of sequences clustered, identical to the proportion found after a time-resolved analysis of the same sequences [3]. Beyond 4.5%, the ratio of these two measures became constant, indicating that as the genetic distance cut-off was relaxed sequences were being added equally to all clusters. The effect of varying the cluster bootstrap threshold was different; fixing the genetic distance at 4.5%, the proportion of sequences in clusters decreased gradually as bootstrap thresholds were increased from 70% to 99% (Figures 1B and 2B).",

These included 63 A subtypes, 219 C and 127 other non-B. All 1790 anonymised sequences had linked sampling date and location information in the HIVRDB. A phylogenetic tree was initially constructed from 1212 sequences of all subtypes collected up to 2005. A total of 148 clusters, containing 431 sequences (35.6%), were supported by a bootstrap \u226590% and had a maximum genetic distance \u22644.5%. One hundred and eight of these clusters were pairs, while the largest contained seventeen sequences. A second tree was built from the entire dataset of 1790 sequences and clusters matched between the early and late trees so that cluster changes could be described. In support of our initial cluster definition, the genetic distance of the new clusters increased above 4.5% only in two clusters despite the addition of 578 sequences, while bootstrap dropped below 0.90 only for six clusters (Figure 3). Finally, each clustered sequence was linked to sample location information in the HIVRDB and the CM was used to sort clusters in 2005 based on whether they contained sequences from a single sample location (\u201csingle\u201d origin) or more (\u201cmultiple\u201d origin). The UK HIV Drug Resistance Database categorizes geographical origin into 17 areas, all of which were represented in this dataset. A large proportion of sequences originate from the London area (one center). Patterns of change of single origin versus multiple origin clusters were compared (R script available in Additional file 2) [29]. Of 148 clusters, 63 were thus classified as multiple origin and 85 as single origin (Additional file 3). For each cluster, cluster growth was then calculated as the number of new sequences per initial sequence [25]. Mean cluster growth differed significantly between single and multiple origin clusters (0.155 vs. 0. 302, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test: p = 0.0016; Additional file 2).",

PhyloPart generates the pairwise distance distribution for a tree and identifies a group of sequences as a cluster if the median of their genetic distances is below a user-input t-percentile threshold of the whole-tree distance distribution. The rooted subtype B tree containing 1381 sequences was analyzed in PhyloPart, varying the t-percentile threshold for cluster identification from 1% to 30%. Upon examination of the output, it appeared that this range reflected median genetic distances within clusters from 4.5% to 9% in the data. Once again, cluster distribution was not very much affected by the cut-off (Figure 1C), but the proportion of sequences in clusters and average cluster size increased as cluster definition was relaxed (Figure 2C). As a t-percentile threshold of 0.01 and 0.05 corresponded to genetic distance cut-offs of 4.5%, and 6.5%, respectively, the CP and PhyloPart output were compared in more depth at each of these two matched thresholds. Each time, the number of clusters and the cluster distributions were near identical (KS test, p = 0.9998 and p = 1 for 4.5% and 6.5% respectively). However, as expected, individual cluster sizes were significantly reduced when maximum within cluster genetic distance was used instead of median (Figure 4; one-sample sign test, p = 6.1*10-5 and p = 0.03 for genetic distances of 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively).",

We conclude that these clusters represent well-delineated epidemiological units in the UK HIV epidemic. In contrast, when the maximum genetic distance threshold was decreased to 1.5%, only half of the clusters were identified. These clusters defined by such a short distance will reflect recent transmissions and frequent samplings [17]. In contrast, the UK HIVRDB contains mostly sequences from chronically infected patients, many of whom were first sequenced long after infection, and so in order to identify relevant clusters, a threshold of 4.5%, as we have used before [3,18], is more appropriate. The effect of the bootstrap threshold was less evident, and so we conclude that genetic distance is the key parameter for epidemiologically relevant clustering. We stress however that the present analysis alone is not sufficient to yield a reusable definition of cluster threshold parameters, as the data set of publicly available sequences was too small for extensive testing. To resolve this issue, we are currently conducting in depth analyses on the UK HIVRDB as a whole (<50,000 sequences). Using the CP many thresholds can be examined very rapidly.",

In previous studies, we have identified clusters in trees based on mean within cluster distance [18,22]. However, we decided to use maximum genetic distance in our tool for three reasons. First, maximum genetic distance (as well as median genetic distance) is less affected by the number of sequences within a cluster (which can be the result of more or less intensive population sampling and contact tracing). When the mean is used, the distance is normalized by the total number of sequences in the cluster, potentially leading to clusters in which most of the sequences are very close together but one sequence is only distantly related to the group. Confirming this prediction, in our longitudinal analysis the genetic distance threshold did not have to be increased in 2007 to capture most 2005 clusters despite the additional of a large number of sequences. Second, maximum genetic distance is a metric more comparable to the time depth used to identify clusters in BEAST [22]. Third, maximum genetic distance is faster to compute, improving program efficiency. We nevertheless plan on adding alternative measures of genetic distance (mean and median) to future releases of the CP. Another difference between the programs is that distances are calculated de-novo from the sequences in the CP, while in PhyloPart, the patristic distances are used. Cluster definition in PhyloPart is a function of the whole tree: a subtree is classified as a cluster if its median genetic distance is smaller than a percentage of the whole tree. However, the user-specified genetic distance threshold in the CP allows external information to be incorporated into the definition, such as the average observed distance within transmission pairs if that is available. We chose this strategy because it is the most widely used definition; in fact, previous studies have demonstrated epidemiologically related viral sequences had less than 4.8% nucleotide substitutions between them [3]. Similarly, because studies vary in the bootstraps they use for support of clusters, we left this as a flexible option for the user to choose.",

Theoretically, PhyloPart will slow down in large datasets, as it calculates all pairwise distances then stores them, so they can be accessed each time they are needed. This is an advantage for smaller datasets and speeds up processing, but for large trees, the time to generate matrices of all pairwise distances increases as a polynomial function of the number of sequences n (n (n-1)/2 computations). The CP calculates pairwise genetic distances within a potential cluster as required even if those distances were already calculated when the parent node was tested (and rejected). Nevertheless, the CP was not slower than PhyloPart on small datasets and in fact completed on average three times more rapidly. On large trees, it becomes faster to calculate subsets of pairwise genetic distances only within potential clusters, even if this must be repeated several times. Another alternative, not explored here, is the single-linkage approach proposed by Wertheim et al [34], which does not require a phylogenetic tree and calculates pairwise distances only once. With expanding sizes of HIV-1 data sets and other fast evolving pathogens, there is increasing need for new faster algorithms.",

If confirmed, these results suggest that targeting interventions on individuals within multiple origin clusters to prevent onward transmission would yield disproportionate results. Such real-time analyses are made possible by the CP and CM. As our purpose here was to demonstrate the functionality of the CP and CM, we chose a simple example. We hope that others will use the tools in more elaborate ways to truly provide insight into the dynamics of HIV transmission, as well as other infectious diseases. The CM, for example, can easily be used to compare clusters between trees built with different methods. Concerning cluster dynamics, we note that new sequences added to clusters do not necessarily reflect new infections: they could reflect new diagnoses within the time frame, and one potential explanation of the observed cluster growth may indeed be referral-based testing.",
