Founder haplotype mosaics were inferred previously by the UNC Systems Genetics Core (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=FounderProbs) using the hidden Markov model (HMM) of Fu et al. (2012) applied to genotype calls from MegaMUGA, a genotyping platform providing data on 77,800 SNP markers (Morgan et al. 2016). The HMM inference provides a vector of 36 probabilities for each CC strain for each of 77,551 loci (each defined as the interval between adjacent SNP markers) across the genome. Rather than using all of the available data for our simulations, we used a reduced version: since adjacent loci often have almost identical descent, mapping using all loci is both computationally expensive and\u2014at least for the purposes of the power analysis\u2014largely redundant. Thus, prior to analysis, the original dataset was reduced by averaging adjacent genomic intervals whose diplotype probabilities were highly similar. Specifically, adjacent genomic intervals were averaged if the maximum L2 norm between the probability vectors of all individuals is less than 10% of the maximum possible L2 norm (2); this reduced the file storage from 610 MB to 288 MB, and the genome from 77,551 to 17,900 intervals (76.9% reduction in positions to be evaluated in a scan).",

Specifically, we used HK regression on the strain means (Valdar et al. 2006a; Zou et al. 2006) via the linear modely\u00af(s)=1\u03bc+PA\u03b2+\u03f5,(3)where y\u00af(s) is the sth simulated n-vector of strain means, P is an n\u00d736 matrix of inferred diplotype probabilities for the sampled CC genomes at the QTL [i.e., P=p(D|genotype data); see Zhang et al. (2014)], and \u03f5 is the n-vector of residual error on the means, distributed as \u03f5\u223cN(0,I(hstrain2+\u03c32/r)). The above implies an eight-allele model (cf Equation 1 with M=I). Although this assumption could lead to reduced power when there are fewer functional alleles, particularly at loci in which the functional alleles are not well represented, it is commonly used in practice, in accordance with the fact that the allelic series of an unmapped QTL would typically be unknown in advance [e.g., Mott et al. (2000); Valdar et al. (2006a,b); Svenson et al. (2012); Gatti et al. (2014)]. Additional factors that might contribute to variation in an experiment, such as covariates or batch effects, are neither simulated nor modeled; it is assumed that such factors would be adequately accounted for by, for instance, addition of suitable covariates, pre-processing (e.g., residualizing) of phenotype values, and ultimately lead to a more-or-less equivalent analysis to that described here. The fit of Equation 3 was compared with that of an intercept-only null model via an F-test, and produced a p-value, reported as its negative base 10 logarithm, the logP. This procedure was performed for all loci across the genome, resulting in a genome scan for y(s).",

The CC panel is a balanced population with respect to founder genomic contributions and, by design, has minimal population structure. These features support the assumption of exchangeability among strain genomes: that under a null model in which the genetic contribution to the phenotype is entirely driven by infinitesimal (polygenic) effects, all permutations of the strain labels (or equivalently, of the strain means vector y(s)) are equally likely to produce a given configuration of y(s). Permutation of the strain means, y(s), was therefore used to find the logP critical value controlling genome-wide type I error rate (GWER) (Doerge and Churchill 1996). Briefly, we sampled 100 permutations and perform genome scans for each; this was done efficiently using a standard matrix decomposition approach (Appendix A). The maximum logPs per genome scan and simulation s were then recorded, and these are fitted to a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) (Dudbridge and Koeleman 2004; Valdar et al. 2006a) using the R package evir (Pfaff and McNeil 2018). The upper \u03b1=0.05 quantile of this fitted GEV was then taken as the \u03b1-level significance threshold, Ta(s). If the maximum observed logP for y(s) in the region of the simulated QTL exceeded Ta(s), then the corresponding locus was considered to be a (positively) detected QTL (see immediately below).",

(LD has been characterized in the CC previously but not summarized with a single point estimate (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012); our choice of 5Mb is therefore an approximation, but we find that it only marginally increased mapping power relative to using smaller windows.) A false positive was declared if one or more QTL were detected on chromosomes other than the chromosome harboring the simulated QTL. Simulations in which a QTL was detected on the correct chromosome but outside the 5Mb window were disregarded; although this was potentially wasteful of data and biased FPR slightly downward due to loss of false positives on the chromosome with the simulated QTL, it avoided the need for arbitrary rules to handle edge cases in which it was ambiguous whether the simulated signal had been detected or not. Power for a given simulation setting was then defined as the proportion of true positives among all simulations at that setting, and the FPR was defined as the proportion of false positives.",

In order to obtain more stable estimates, we used a regularization procedure, estimating the mean distance and 95% quantiles as weighted averages of the observed values and prior pseudo-observations. Specifically, for an arbitrarily small but detected true positive QTL, it is reasonable to expect the peak signal to be distributed uniformly within the \u00b1 5Mb window. This implies a mean location error of 2.5Mb and a 95% quantile of 4.75Mb. Thus, when calculating the regularized mean location error we assumed 10 prior pseudo-observations of 2.5Mb, and when calculating the regularized 95% quantile we assume 10 prior pseudo-observations of 4.75Mb. This number of pseudo-observations represents 1% of the maximum number of possible data points.",

(2014); Orgel et al. (2019)]. In particular, human genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which often use much larger sample sizes, routinely report QTL with estimated effect sizes far smaller than is detectable in the CC. Nonetheless, there are reasons to expect effect sizes in the CC to be larger than in humans. Human GWASs are observational, and as such include many additional sources of noise, reducing QTL effect sizes relative to what would be possible in more tightly-controlled experimental designs. Experimental populations will also have larger QTL effect sizes because: 1) they typically have more balanced allele frequencies; 2) in the case of panels of RILs, such as the CC, they are homozygous across the genome, which increases the contrast in additive allele effects and thus boosts additive QTL effect size; and 3), again for RILs, they furnish biological replicates, which, as illustrated in Equation 4, can increase effect size by reducing individual error.",

One of the advantages of simulation is the ability to evaluate the impact of many of these assumptions, as well as the consideration of new scenarios by re-running the simulation under different settings, or by elaborating the simulation itself. We have attempted to make re-running the simulations under different settings straightforward for other researchers by developing a software package for this purpose. This package could be used to investigate highly-specialized questions, such as the power for specific combinations of CC strains or assessing how the power to detect QTL varies depending on genomic position. In future work, the simulation code itself could be expanded to investigate additional topics of interest, such as how power is influenced by variance heterogeneity or model mis-specification.",

As such, the results of our simulations provide tailored power calculations to aide the design of future QTL mapping experiments in the CC. Additionally, we evaluate how the balance of alleles at the QTL can strongly influence power to map QTL in the CC. We make available the R package SPARCC that we developed for running these simulations and analyses. It leverages an efficient model fitting approach in order to explore power in a level of detail that has previously been impractical, it is replicable, and it can be extended to user-specified questions of interest.",

Increasing the number of strains reduces the location error, both in terms of the mean and 95% quantile, more so than QTL effect size, also shown in Figure S6.
