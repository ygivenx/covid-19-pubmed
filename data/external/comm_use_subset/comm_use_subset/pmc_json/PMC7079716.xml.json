The HPAI virus was primarily found in domesticated poultry and wild migratory birds, the natural host reservoir for the virus, spreading to humans who came into close contact with infected birds. With a case fatality rate of 50\u201360%, HPAI is one of the most virulent influenza viruses surpassing the fatality rate of the 1917\u20131918 pandemic influenza [3].

However, this clinical evaluation did not suggest a significant decrease in mortality by antiviral treatment with oseltamivir [3,11]. Cumulative reported studies suggested the survival rate in treated patients was 30% (13 of 34) compared with 25% (4 of 16) in untreated patients. The lack of a significant increase in survival within treated patients may be attributable to the timing of administration of the antiviral treatment. Patients were only treated during the later stages of the infection when the presence of irreversible pulmonary damage/failure and/or pathological changes associated with the immune hyperinduction was likely to be present. Indeed the efficacy of oseltamivir treatment was dependent on how early the drug treatment was administered; survival rates of 53% were found for patients treated within 5 days of onset of illness and decreased to 26% administration commenced after 6 days [3,11].",

            "text": "A number of anti-inflammatory drugs (administered as either as mono- or combination therapies) have been evaluated for the treatment of CS during infections with influenza. However, one example illustrates the therapeutic challenges associated with administering anti-inflammatory drugs as monotherapies for treating acute viral infections. It was found that glucocorticoid treatment administered for the suppression of cytokine production did not protect mice from lethal infection with HPIA (A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1) [16]. Further, in human case studies during the H5N1 outbreaks in Southeast Asia patients who were treated with steroids such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (with or without the antiviral drug oseltamivir) were found to have high mortality rates and steroid treatment did not improve clinical outcomes [9]. The use of COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, mesalazine), both as a monotherapy and in combination with the anti-influenza drug (neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir), has also been considered within experimental models of influenza. It was found that COX-2 inhibitors enhanced the antiviral efficacy of zanamivir in the treatment of mice against infection with influenza A/H5N1 virus [17]. In this study, all treatments were administered at 48 h post challenge to mimic the timely lines associated with diagnosis in a clinical setting. Under this treatment regimen, the use of zanamivir alone did not result in significant improvement in the survival rate (13.3%), but enhanced survival (10.7 days) when compared with the untreated control group (0% survival at 6.6 days) [17]. Zanamivir alone did reduce virus load in the lungs, but not inflammation and mortality. Similarly, the use of COX-2 inhibitors alone (celecoxib or mesalazine, or both) did not provide any improvement in the survival rate (0% survival) but prolonged survival time (between 8.5 and 9.5 days compared with 6.6 days for control). However, when the infected mice were treated with a triple combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine administered at 4 h post virus challenge, there were significant improvements in the survival rate (53.3%), prolongation of the survival time (13.3 days), compared with the zanamivir alone administered at 4 h post-virus challenge (13.3% survival and 8.4 days survival time). Additionally, it was found that the treatment of mice with the triple drug combination also resulted in higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and reduced pulmonary inflammation [17]. The results from this study suggest that the combination treatment of zanamivir with COX-2 inhibitors can significantly improve survival outcome and that this combination therapy can provide synergistic therapeutic outcomes by reducing cytokine dysfunction and preventing apoptosis [17,18].",

The c-Jun N-terminal Kinases signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of numerous cell activities including proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation, and is reported to be activated during influenza A virus infection and replication [22]. c-Jun is a downstream molecule of c-Jun N-terminal Kinases and the increased expression of the c-Jun gene has been observed in proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. During infection with influenza H5N1 virus the c-Jun protein is activated to its phosphorylated form and enhances the transcription of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 and the chemokine RANTES which contributes to cytokine overproduction; collectively resulting an increase in inflammation [23].",

Additionally, the DZ 13 suppression of c-Jun also decreased CD8+ T-cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions, reduced virus titer and tissue histopathology such as inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial edema in the lung [23]. Taken together, the promising results show that suppression of key inflammatory gene expression, such as DZ 13 knockdown of c-Jun gene expression, can potentially be a powerful strategy for the downregulation of inflammation responses (CS) and leads to enhanced protection and therapeutic outcomes against severe and highly fatal virus infection including the HPIA virus [23]. Furthermore, it is postulated that DZ 13 may have broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory effects. It is also possible to explore whether this approach of downregulating the cytokine overproduction can have synergistic therapeutic effect when used in combination with an antiviral drug such as oseltamivir or zanamivir. However, further animal studies are warranted to support these concepts.",

Myxomavirus is an enveloped DNA virus belonging to the poxviridae family. It causes fatal myxomatosis in rabbits by evading the host's immune response, and causing pathological damages. The virus produces a number of extracellular proteins which protects the virus from destruction by the host's antiviral immune responses. One of these proteins, SERP-1, is a potent inhibitor of both thrombolytic and thrombotic proteases and has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties in a wide range of animal models [36,37]. In a small exploratory study, wild-type BALB/c mice infected with mouse-adapted Ebola virus (Zaire 1976 Mayinga strain) treated with SERP-1 was found to increase survival time/rate and this was dose dependent, with higher drug concentration offering higher protection [34]. Furthermore, treated animals were found to have decreased tissue necrosis and cell invasion in both spleen and livers, compared with untreated infected mice [34]. In addition, it is noteworthy that purified SERP-1 protein has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of vascular injury highlighting its potential broader therapeutic utility.",

If left untreated these inflammatory-driven responses can to sepsis and death. When first infected by the four serotypes of Dengue virus (DEV-I to DEV-V) the majority of cases tend to be asymptomatic or mild. Complications can arise when the individual is subsequently re-infected with a different serotype of DEV, where the disease becomes more severe and can lead to potentially fatal DHF and Dengue shock syndrome. In patients with severe forms of Dengue the serum levels of several cytokines including IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 are elevated and the severity of disease is thought to be direrctly linked to increases in the inflammatory cytokine [39]. The aberrant cytokine levels are known to be associated with increased incidence in the development of DHF and thus suppressing cytokine levels has been used as an approach to improve therapeutic outcome in Dengue patients.",

Patients receiving doxycycline or tetracycline treatment were demonstrated to have significant reductions in their serum levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, compared with untreated control patients. Downregulation of these cytokines was observed to be persistent and continued for between 3 days to 7 days following treatment [40]. Furthermore, doxycycline was found to be more effective than tetracycline in the modulation of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulted in the greater reduction in serum cytokine levels [40].",

Doxycycline is an antibiotic belonging to the class of tetracyclines which are known to possess known immunomodulating effects, including reducing serum levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [41]. Doxycycline has also been found to be able to inhibit Dengue virus replication in cell culture and is hypothesized to interact with the Dengue virus E protein to inhibit a conformational change which is required for virus entry into target cells [42]. More clinical studies will be needed in the future to determine whether treatment with doxycycline can provide significant therapeutic outcomes in DF, DHF and DSS patients by evaluating disease severity, survival rates and decreasing the required duration for hospitalization. Furthermore, it will be worthwhile to do small exploratory studies to determine whether doxycycline can provide any beneficial therapeutic effects to other virus-induced hemorrhagic fevers, although any therapeutic benefit with antibiotic treatment must be weighed against the potential risks associated with its use including the rise of antibiotic resistance. Interestingly, the use of antibiotics have been used as supportive antimicrobial therapy in Ebola patients in Guinea, but the direct effect of antibiotic treatment in this study was not known [33].",

In human infections, Zika fever is less severe compared with DHF and DF, but its pathogenesis is associated with the polyfunctional T-cell activation and involves the elevation of several serum cytokines [43]. In the acute infection phase, significant increases in the serum cytokines concentrations of IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-\u03b1-induced protein 10 (IP-10), RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1, compared with normal controls. In the late recovery phase, IL-10 levels were found to be highest [43]. Since both DF and Zika viruses are both mosquito-borne flaviviruses spread by the same vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and share similar immunopathogenesis pattern in T-cell activation and inflammatory cytokine inductions, it is proposed by some that lessons learned from Dengue research may expedite the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for Zika virus [44]",

Novel viruses will continue to evolve through naturally occuring mutations and pose a realistic threat to global public health as well as having significant impacts to the economy. Many of these emerging novel viruses are likely to be hard to protect against due to lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines that are available therefore preparedness through the identification of new/novel treatments and therapeutic strategies are essential for the future from a public health perspective. In particular, the development of approaches that target common events or pathways used by pathogenic viruses such as the induction of CS offer the potential for treatments that are effectice across different viral families and/or strains.",

It is likely that the most effective treatment strategy for virus-induced CS will be a comprehensive well-balanced strategy that is effective in downregulating inflammatory cytokines, reducing apoptosis and tissue damage/injury and ultimately restores the natural antiviral immune responses by maintaining physiological homeostasis in the body (Figure 1B). The use of a drug monotherapy may be insufficient to achieve this outcome. However, it is likely that the successful treatment of human patients infected with a CS-inducing emerging virus will need to encompass the use of a two- or three-pronged therapeutic strategy involving; an antiviral drug (if available), alongside the adjunct biological or chemical immune-modulating agent which suppresses CS and supportive therapy (fluid, electrolyte replacement and/or oxygen therapy).",
