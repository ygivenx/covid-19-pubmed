            "text": "Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, which is mainly \u03b1-helical with very few beta sheets, into a \u03b2-sheet-rich form, PrPSc\n[1]\u2013[5]. The mechanism by which PrPC is converted to the abnormal isoform is still not clear, but it is presumed to involve a PrPC\u2013PrPSc complex, with the latter serving as a conformational template [6]. In this model, PrPSc serves as a template that binds to PrPC and produces a conformational conversion into the abnormal isoform. This raises the issue of whether there are critical contact sites that mediate conversion. If this is the case, interfering with or blocking complex formation should prevent the PrPC to PrPSc conversion process. Previous reports have described anti-PrP antibodies that can stop or hinder the conversion process add reference 44 and renumber [7]\u2013[14].",

We compared the effect of individual PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) on the PrPC\u2013PrPSc conversion process using both an N2a/22L cell culture model and the test-tube PMCA system. Our results demonstrate that the Mabs have a range of inhibitory effects on the PrPC\u2013PrPSc conversion process. The degree of inhibition is Mab specific and more dependent on the antibody targeting region than on the specific epitope being recognized. Furthermore, since the PMCA-based method is dose-dependent and rapid, it may serve as an ideal screening assay for potential inhibitors of both PrPSc accumulation and the progression of prion diseases.",

PrP-specific Mabs were generated against recombinant (murine or hamster) PrP or brain-derived proteinase K (PK)-resistant purified PrPSc\n[35] from brains of clinical mice infected with the ME7 mouse-adapted scrapie strain or clinical hamsters infected with the 263K hamster-adapted scrapie strain. The Mabs used in this study were purified (Montage Antibody Purification kit; Millipore, Billerica, CA), isotyped (ELISA Mouse Antibody Isotyping kit; Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL), and epitope mapped (Table 1). The immunoreactivity of all the Mabs were analyzed on western blots against denatured, PK-digested and undigested PrP derived from uninfected and infected brain homogenates as well as by ELISA against recombinant PrP. With the exception of Mab 3F4, each of the individual Mabs had equivalent immunoreactivity against murine and hamster PrPSc on an immunoglobulin concentration basis. All of the Mabs were highly reactive against both hamster PrPC and PrPSc isoforms and, for the PMCA studies, were individually added to the 10% NBH at a final concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/ml. A 10% 263K brain homogenate was prepared in PBS only and diluted to a final concentration of 10\u22124. A 100 \u00b5l aliquot of this homogenate was initially combined with 10 \u00b5l of 10% NBH (with or without added Mab). Each sample was sonicated (QSONIC at 480W power, 60 Amplitude, 40,000 J energy, 90 sec process time, 3 sec pulse on\u22121 sec pulse off), then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. This was defined as one cycle of serial PMCA (sPMCA). At the completion of each cycle, an additional 10 \u00b5l of 10% NBH (with or without Mab) was added. At the end of every five cycles, 100 \u00b5l of the total volume was transferred to a new tube containing an equal volume of 10% NBH (with or without Mab) and the cycling reactions continued. At the completion of 40 cycles (sPMCA40), 500 \u00b5l from each sample was PK-treated (100 \u00b5g/ml final concentration, 50\u00b0C, 30 min), followed by the addition of protease inhibitor cocktail. The sample was heated (100\u00b0C, 10 min) and then centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 2 min at room temperature. The supernatant was combined with 6X Laemmli sample buffer, and 50 \u00b5l was electrophoresed in a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) with 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with 2 \u00b5g/ml biotinylated Mab 08-6/2F11. The membrane was washed 3 times (10 min each) with PBST, incubated for 60 min in HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) (1\u22365000 in PBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk) followed by 3 additional PBST washes and detection of proteins with ECL Supersignal West Dura kit (Thermo Fisher).

Treatment with the Mabs did not result in any cytotoxicity to the N2a/22L cells throughout the incubation period. Further, incubation of the. N2a/22L cells with 10 \u00b5g/ml purified, irrelevant mouse IgG had no effect on PrPSc formation compared to untreated N2a/22L cultures (Figs. 2A and 2B). Mab 3F4 did not reduce PrPSc formation compared to control N2a/22L cultures lacking Mab. Mab 3F4 does not react with mouse prion protein so this was not surprising [38]. The ability of a singly added Mab to inhibit PrPSc formation was not related to a specific epitope since all of the remaining singly added Mabs inhibited PrPSc formation to varying degrees. Of the individually added Mabs, 5D6 was the most effective at inhibiting PrPSc formation (95% inhibition) while 3A2 was the least effective (38% inhibition). Targeting the amino terminus with Mab 7E4 was effective at inhibiting 73% PrPSc formation as was targeting the octapeptide repeat region using Mab 10E4 which resulted in almost 90% inhibition. Strangely, although their epitopes overlap, Mab 11F12 was less effective than Mab 5D6 at inhibiting PrPSc formation (53% vs 95% inhibition). This is in contrast to Mabs 8E9 and 1B11, which have overlapping epitopes with 8E9 being more expansive, and resulted in 52% and 42% inhibition, respectively. The combination of 5D6 and 11F12 did not result in an additive inhibitory effect and, in fact, resulted in less inhibition than either one alone. This was confirmed in studies where the addition of 8E9 to 5D6 and 11F12 caused a 45% PrPSc inhibition, which was slightly better than 8E9 alone, although the predicted additive inhibitory effect of 63% for the three Mab combination (48% for 8E9 plus 15% for the 5D6 and 11F12 combination) was not observed.",

This system also allowed us to evaluate whether accessibility of Mab to membrane associated PrPC in the living cells influences the PrPC to PrPSc conversion process. Mabs (12\u201350 \u00b5g/ml final concentration) were added throughout the sPMCA40 protocol along with the 10% NBH spiked with a 10\u22124 dilution of 263K infected brain homogenate as described in the Methods section. This dilution of infected brain homogenate does not result in detectable PK resistant PrPSc immunostaining (Fig. 3A) and, therefore, did not interfere with the detection of newly formed PrPSc. At the completion of sPMCA40, the samples were digested with PK (100 \u00b5g/ml) and analyzed on immunoblots using biotinylated Mab 2F11 which reacts equally with both hamster PrPC and PrPSc. It is interesting to note that although the 263K-infected brain homogenate displayed the 3 band pattern typical for the multiple glycosylated forms of PrPC and PrPSc (Fig. 3A), the sPMCA40 products in the positive controls and Mab-treated reactions consisted of only a single diglycosylated 30 kDa PrPSc band observed after PK digestion at the higher levels of inhibition, >50%, but had two bands or a smear when there was less inhibition (Fig. 3B).",

We performed sPMCA with different Mab concentrations to determine the minimum amount of Mab necessary to inhibit the conversion process. Using a 10\u22124 dilution of 263K-infected hamster brain homogenate as the PrPSc seed and a 10% normal brain homogenate (NBH) as the source of PrPC, we tested the ability of Mabs to inhibit the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. For each Mab, final concentrations of 12 \u00b5g/ml (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24), 25 \u00b5g/ml (lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25) and 50 \u00b5g/ml (lanes 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 26) were prepared in hamster NBH and used in the sPMCA reactions. Compared to sPMCA40, which contained no Mab (lane 1) and with the exception of 02\u20133/3A2, the majority of the PrP-specific Mabs inhibited the conversion process in a dose-related manner although some were more effective than others. Mabs 7E4, 10E4, 11F12, 8E11, and 8E9 completely inhibited the conversion process at 50 \u00b5g/ml while Mabs 1B11 and 2F7 inhibited the conversion process to a lesser degree. The inhibition caused by the Mabs was a specific response since sPMCA40 studies replacing Mabs with purified normal mouse IgG (at 12\u201350 \u00b5g/ml) in the 10% NBH did not cause any inhibition of PrPSc formation (data not shown). It is interesting to note that, with the exception of only 8E9, the epitopes for all the Mabs that caused complete inhibition are located in the amino half of the PrP while those that caused incomplete inhibition are located in the carboxy half of PrP. There was good correlation between the extent of PrPSc inhibition when 10 \u00b5g/ml Mab in cell culture was compared to 12 \u00b5g/ml Mab with sPMCA40.",

Compared to the other antibodies in this study, Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 had the most pronounced effects on PrPSc formation as demonstrated by the low concentrations of 3 and 6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, causing complete inhibition (Fig. 4). The potent inhibitory effect of 5D6 on PrPSc observed using sPMCA40 coincides with its dramatic effect in the N2a/22L culture model. Furthermore, the poor PrPSc inhibition by 3A2 with sPMCA40 (Fig. 3B) corresponded well with the poor inhibition (only 32% reduction compared to negative control) observed in the cell culture system (Fig. 2A and 2B).",

F\u00e9raudet et al. [56] screened 145 anti-PrP Mabs for their capacity to inhibit PrPSc replication in infected N2a or Rov9 cells.

            "text": "To more completely explore the possible therapeutic effect of anti-PrP antibodies, and to establish another system to analyze the influence of Abs on the conversion process, we screened Mabs produced in our laboratory for their capacity to inhibit PrPSc formation. This screening was performed using N2a/22L cells and cell-free sPMCA. In N2a/22L cultures, all Mabs that react with mouse PrP reduce PrPSc formation although with varying efficiency. Thus, similar to previous results [55], we found that the ability to inhibit PrPC to PrPSc conversion was not restricted to a single epitope or limited to a specific region of the protein. However, the greatest inhibition was observed with Mabs that targeted epitopes in the amino terminal, unstructured region of the PrP. The greatest inhibition in the N2a/22L cells was with Mab 5D6. This is consistent with a prior study using Mab 6D11 (anti-PrP residues 95\u2013105) which in a screen of multiple Mabs, only one produced the greatest inhibition (\u223c100%) [12]. Mab 6D11 has also been shown to have some efficacy in vivo prolonging the pre-symptomatic incubation period [57]. The Mab inhibition results obtained using PMCA were similar to that found in the cell culture system. PMCA has the advantages over the cell culture model of being cost-effective, simple, rapid, sensitive, and more amenable to studies of dose dependence. For identification of potential candidate Mabs that might have in vivo activity it is likely that such Mabs would have to produce 90 to 100% inhibition in the much simpler in vitro systems.",

            "text": "The interaction of PrPC to PrPSc is critically dependent on the structural compatibility of the molecules as supported by the existence of a species barrier for prion infection, related to minor differences in the primary sequence of PrPC in different species. Therefore, it is not surprising that antibodies that may alter or mask the critical epitopes on PrPC and/or PrPSc, involved during the mutual conformational complementarity required in prion propagation, will be inhibitory for prion replication. Although many anti-PrP antibodies targeting different regions of PrP may have some therapeutic effect in vitro, it is not clear how this relates to their efficacy in vivo. On the one hand, it is tempting to speculate that only the antibodies exhibiting near complete inhibition in vitro would be effective in vivo given the obstacle of the blood brain barrier and access to PrP in cells. However, it is also possible that only partial inhibition of conversion is required in vivo allowing the cells to \u201crecover\u201d. In either case, it would be advantageous for these therapeutic antibodies to have high affinities of binding to PrPC and/or PrPSc, as well as targeting specific critical PrP domains. One can hypothesize that the simultaneous targeting of more than one critical epitope will lead to greater benefits. However, co-treatment experiments performed with a mixture of two antibodies compatibly binding cell-surface PrPC did not show any benefit with compared to treatment involving a single Mab in our current experiments. In a previous study [58], we demonstrated synergistic binding with one of our antibody pairs. Synergistic binding of inhibitory Mabs, i.e. reaction with an antibody that increases the binding of the second antibody, would be predicted to enhance the inhibitory effect. Further studies with antibody pairs fitting this description will be required to test this hypothesis. In addition, determining the significance of the Mab\u2019s ability to bind both PrPC and PrPSc may provide further insight into the conversion process.",
