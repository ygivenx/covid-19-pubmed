Moreover, it aids in epidemiologic tracking of local outbreaks or epidemics by implementing proper infection control measures and administering effective antimicrobial therapy. Rapid laboratory identification of RTI pathogens has been associated with up to 50% reduction in hospital stays, 30% reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and 20% reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures [9]. Multiplexed molecular assays that can concurrently detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction have been increasingly adopted in clinical microbiology laboratories in the recent years [10]. Several studies have shown that these molecular tests have superior diagnostic capacity and cost-effectiveness of molecular tests when compared to conventional and other diagnostic methods [11, 12].",

However, variations in the gene and amino acid sequences in different influenza virus subtypes due to rapid mutations of the viral RNA polymerase may affect the results of these tests. With the emergence of human infections due to the swine-origin influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) virus in North America in 2010 and more recently the avian-origin influenza A H7N9 and H5N6 in China [13\u201315], it would be important to ascertain the analytical sensitivities of these rapid tests for the novel influenza viruses [16, 17]. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that xTAG RVP has lower sensitivity for detection of H7N9 in patient samples and culture isolates [16, 17].",

Additionally, an H5N6 avian isolate [H5N6 (A/Great Egret/H5N6/HK/2016)] was also included.

The viral M gene genome copy numbers per ml of each virus dilution were determined by real-time, quantitative RT-PCR (q-PCR) as previously described with modification [29, 30]. Briefly, 5 \u03bcL purified RNA was amplified in a 25 \u03bcL reaction containing 0.5 \u03bcL Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase/Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.05 \u03bcL ROX reference dye (25 mM), 12.5 \u03bcL of 2x reaction buffer, 800 nmol/L forward primer (5\u2032-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3\u2032), 800 nmol/L reverse primer (5\u2032-AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3\u2032), and probe 200 nmol/L (FAM-5\u2032-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-3\u2032-BHQ1). The thermal cycling conditions were 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C for reverse transcription and then 2 min at 95\u00b0C for RT inactivation/initial denaturation, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 30 s at 55\u00b0C. All reactions were performed using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). For quantitative assay, a reference standard plasmid was prepared by cloning the target M gene amplicon into pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPO\u2122 TA Cloning\u2122 Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The copy number of the standard plasmid was determined based on molar concentration of the plasmid (1 molar is equivalent to about 6.0221415 \u00d7 1023 copies numbers). A series of 6 log10 dilutions, equivalent to 1 \u00d7 101 to 1 \u00d7 106 copies per reaction, were then prepared from the reference standard plasmid to generate calibration curves and run in parallel with the test samples. The limit of detection of the M gene qRT-PCR is 10 copies per reaction at 95% confidence level. The same virus dilutions were inoculated onto MDCK cells to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) using the Reed-Muench method as previously described [28].",

Total nucleic acid extraction was isolated by using the NucliSENS easyMAG instrument (bioM\u00e9rieux). Briefly, 10 \u03bcl of MS2 internal control was first added to 200 \u00b5l of sample. The mixture was added to 2 ml of lysis buffer and was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The lysed sample was then transferred to the well of a plastic vessel with 100 \u00b5l of silica. This was followed by automatic magnetic separation. Nucleic acid was recovered in 110 \u00b5l elution buffer. By using a parallel specimen (300 \u00b5l), nucleic acid extraction, PCR, and detection were performed in FilmArray according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NxTAG RPP incorporates multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with the Luminex proprietary universal tag sorting system on the Luminex platform for detecting respiratory pathogen targets according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the extracted total nucleic acid is added to preplated Lyophilized Bead Reagents (LBRs) and mixed to resuspend the reaction reagents. The reaction is amplified via RT-PCR and the reaction product undergoes bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well. The hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the MAGPIX instrument, and the signals are analyzed using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay File for SYNCT\u2122 Software (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA).",

These findings show that NxTAG RRP has greatly improved the sensitivity for detecting H7N9 over the xTAG RVP. Besides, NxTAG RPP has also improved sensitivity for detecting other respiratory viruses over xTAG RVP (1 adenovirus and 2 bocavirus). These findings corroborate another recent report on the partial comparison between the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay and the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Panel Fast Assay v2 [32]. NxTAG RPP detected 12 more pathogens than FilmArray RP in our study, with 50% (6/12) being enterovirus/rhinovirus. The other additional positives detected by NxTAG RPP were adenovirus (2), parainfluenza virus 4b (1), hMPV (1), H1N1pdm (1), and M. pneumoniae (1). Overall, 8 positives, hMPV (1), P2 (1), P4 (3), enterovirus/rhinovirus (2), and M. pneumoniae (1), were not detected by NxTAG RPP.
