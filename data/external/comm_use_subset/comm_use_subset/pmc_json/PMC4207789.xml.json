In this mean time, the infection spread to other cities and the whole country was already taken by the end of the 1990s. The current status of the AIDS infection in Brazil is depicted in Figure 1, where the size of the circles is proportional to the logarithm of yi,t and the histograms along the axis detail the annual absolute frequencies as function of the geographic position of the cities. A chronological evolution of the AIDS cases per year among Brazilian cities is available as (Figure S1).

The curve of Equation (1) is obtained as the solution of the Richard's differential equation and represents a generalized logistic growth [26], [27]. Classically, logistic-like equations have a vast application in systems related to the dynamics of populations where there is a strong competition of increasing and establishing factors, exactly as in the case of diseases growing and spreading [28].

This type of curves have also been identified in SI (susceptible-infected) simulations of the initial evolution of epidemic outbreaks in growing scale-free networks with local structures [29]. Similar curves has also been identified in networks whose nodes are not only the media to spread the virus, but also to disseminate their opinions about it [30]. In the AIDS spreading case, the establishment of an almost constant growth per year after 1999 (Figure 2A) could be associated with factors such as the impact on using ARV therapies as well as the extensive broadcast prevention campaigns realized in Brazil [31]. It is also evident that the limit  with  leads to the Gompertz model, that was originally proposed to model mortality of an aging population [32]. Almost century later, this approach still has applications in biological growth curve [33], in survival analysis [34] and in regeneration [35]. A least-squared regression of the Gompertz curve with  to the data (see the continuous curve on Figure 2A) leads to  and  (), where the uncertainties correspond to 99% confidence intervals.

The country has been investing systematically for years. For example, only in 2008, Brazilian government invested more than US$ 600 million (around 1/3 of the amount spent in Caribbean and all the three Americas) in HIV domestic and international spending [14]. As a consequence, these efforts should have had an impact over the epidemic of AIDS in Brazil. To quantify such impact, disregarding other possible contributions, we split all the Brazilian cities with at least one AIDS case since 1989 into 4 groups accordingly to their average absolute frequency per year, denoted by \u2329 yi,t \u232a in years and defined as an arithmetic mean of yi,t: Group I accommodates 4029 cities with \u2329yi,t\u232a<2. Group II encompasses 565 cities with 2\u2264\u2329yi,t\u232a\u226410. Group III accommodates 259 cities with 10<\u2329yi,t\u232a\u226484, and, finally, Group IV covers 48 cities with \u2329yi,t\u232a>84. It is evident from Figures 4 that, yi,t has a well-defined allometry with the population of cities. For this reason, separate groups of cities accordingly to \u2329yi,t\u232a is also equivalent to separate yi,t by population-sizes, apart from random fluctuations. In Figure 5 we show average values and variance for each one of these groups. We can see that for small cities (Groups I and II), the average number of cases and the respective fluctuations are still growing, while large cities (Groups III and IV) exhibit a different behavior: the number of cases are already decreasing, as well as the fluctuations. This could reflect that the intensive broadcast programs of the Brazilian government against the infection has been giving results mainly in the largest urban centers, where is concentrated most of the cases. Intense treatment therapies started in Brazil at the beginning of the 1990s and had a peak in 1996 with the introduction of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) which substantially reduces the infectiousness of people living with AIDS [11], [46]. Estimates suggest that more than 1.2 million of life-years are estimated to have been gained in Brazil between 1996 and 2009 [14]. Their impact over the frequency of new infection cases is evident in cities of the groups III and IV since the end of the 1990s. Many therapeutic approaches have been under constant investigation in order to develop vaccines against the HIV virus or at least control some effects of the infection. But ongoing research is unavoidable to identify a solution to this devastating worldwide epidemic.",

In the AIDS case, the establishing agents seems to be connected to the impact of the large-scale control and programs of HIV/AIDS intervention in Brazil, like the extensive broadcast prevention campaigns and the evolution with the antiretroviral therapies [11], [45], [47]. Looking carefully at Figure 2A it is possible to identify that, mainly after the year 1999, there is a tendency to saturation of .

For the AIDS epidemics in Brazil, we found that this exponential provides the parameter  (inset of Figure 2B) which are in good agreement with the growth of AIDS in some Europeans countries [36]. For small time scales (typically smaller than the characteristic time for infection-related deaths) the prevalence of an infection can be associated to the whole number of infected individuals. Using this assumption, we obtained Figure 2C, which shows that the growth in the absolute frequency of cases is decreasing with time. This result is consistent with the literature [48] and predicts that the infection is growing slower with time. It should be noted that the fluctuations after ca. 1992 occurs because it is the region where the small time scale is already broken (ca. 10 years for AIDS).",

Assuming that this behavior is mainly due to the results of the programs and strategies, against the AIDS infection, we focused on the level of cities, elaborating Figure 5. By using it, we showed that the first results of the efforts against the infection occurred mainly in urban centers with an average of more than 10 AIDS cases per year (Groups III and IV). That is, the infection is not expected to grow uncontrollably in such cities; in particular, it is expected to lose its strength in the largest urban centers (average of more than 84 AIDS cases per year). Naturally, this result is reinforced by the power law decaying in the actual reproduction number (Figure 2C), what indicates that the fraction of number of new cases per case is decreasing and whose effect is noted mainly in the larger cities because the fluctuations of cases appears to be smaller. On the other hand, the average number of new infections per year (as well as their fluctuations) in cities of the groups I and II are still growing. The data is not long enough in time to identify if this fact is just a delay period or if such cities have not experienced sufficiently the Brazilian control strategies against AIDS. In any case, they merit further attention from the Brazilian health authorities. In a general summary, we proposed in this work an alternative approach to the usual methods of epidemics analysis, emphasizing how the dynamics of the virus at the level of municipalities behaves collectively.",
