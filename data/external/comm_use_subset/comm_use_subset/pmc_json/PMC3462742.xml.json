Flt3L is the ligand for Flt3, which is a key regulator for DC commitment and development. Mice administered with Flt3L displayed the expansion of certain subtypes of DCs such as the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs) in the spleen [8]. Studies have shown that pDCs play an important role in the induction of Tregs in vivo manifested by that their precursors are able to prolong graft survival [9]. Studies in hematopoietic cell transplantation also revealed that Flt3L is a potent mobilizer to induce murine hematopoietic chimerism, while long-term persistence of donor hematopoietic cells in peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues of organ allograft recipients is postulated to be an essential prerequisite for the induction of donor-specific tolerance [10], [11].",

The enhanced allograft survival is associated with the induction of tolerogenic DCs along with the production of CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and increased allograft autophagy.

A murine cardiac allograft transplantation model was employed to address this question. As shown in Figure 1A, untreated recipients rapidly rejected their grafts (7.6\u00b10.516 days) along with typical pathological features of acute rejection (Fig. 1B). Similar pathological features were observed in recipients treated with either PBS or rGST (controls, Figure 1B). As expected, administration of Rapa significantly increased graft mean survival time (MST) (16.9\u00b12.767 days, Fig. 1A). Similarly, recipients treated with Flt3L doubled allograft MST (13.1\u00b11.287 days, Fig. 1A). In sharp contrast, a significant enhanced graft survival was observed in mice treated with Flt3L and low-dose of Rapa (36.4\u00b118.704 days, Fig. 1A). Remarkably, about 20% of recipients showed long-term graft survival (MST>100 days, Fig. 1A). In consistent with these results, a significant reduction for inflammatory infiltration was observed in the allograft sections (Fig. 1B).",

As shown in Figure 4A, T cells derived from Flt3L/Rapa treated mice exhibited a significantly lower proliferative response against donor BALB/c DCs in MLR when compared with that of T cells derived from untreated, rGST-treated and PBS-treated recipients. Unexpectedly, a similar proliferation rate was noted in recipients treated with either Flt3L or Rapa alone as compared with that of recipients treated with Flt3L/Rapa. This result promoted us to further examine cytokine production in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Of Interestingly note, the production of IL-10 was significantly higher in the Flt3L/Rapa treated mice. More importantly, although T cells derived from Flt3L or Rapa treated mice showed similar potency for proliferation (Fig. 4A), but their capacity for secretion of IL-10 was similar to those T cells from control mice (Fig. 4B). Collectively, our data suggest that Flt3L/Rapa treatment enhances IL-10 secretion which could favor the induction of T anergy.",

As shown in Fig. 6A, only low levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 II were detected in control mice (rGST, untreated and PBS groups), but higher levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 II were observed in mice treated with Flt3L or Rapa alone. Importantly, the highest Beclin-1 and LC3 II expressions were noted in Flt3L/Rapa treated mice. To further confirm these results, we did immunohistochemical analysis, and similar results were obtained (Fig. 6A). To examine the functional relevance for the enhanced autophagy in allograft survival, we performed similar transplantation along with the administration of 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor [19], [20]. As expected, administration of 3-MA significantly repressed autophagy as determined by Western blot and immunohitochemical analysis (Fig. 6B). Remarkably, repression of autophagy significantly attenuated Flt3L/Rapa therapy mediated protection against allograft rejection (Fig. 6C). In consistent with this result, we also observed a decrease for the number of regulatory T cells and regulatory DCs (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that autophagy plays an essential role in Flt3L/Rapa therapy mediated protection against allograft rejection.",
