Sixteen hemagglutinin (HA) molecular types (designated H1 to H16) and nine neuraminidase (NA) molecular types (designated N1 to N9) have been identified, although only a few of them occur in viruses causing human diseases. Identification and selection of sequences to be used on a microarray are particularly challenging, especially for rapidly mutating viruses. Antigenic drift is an ongoing process for influenza A viruses resulting in continuous evolution and annual epidemics. Moreover, the segmented nature of the influenza A virus genome can lead to reassortments during coinfection thus contributing to their vast genetic diversity and pandemic potential.",

This allows identification of pathogens with sequences similar but not identical to those represented on the microarray. A resequencing microarray was designed in order to allow identification of genetically diverse human RNA rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, with a minimum number of prototype 5'UTR sequences [26]. One respiratory pathogen resequencing microarray allowed the detection of geographically distant human H1N1, H3N2 and avian H5N1 influenza virus strains covering the period between 1999 and 2005 [27,28]. More recently, the same team developed a broad-range resequencing microarray for universal detection and identification of all the possible combinations of the 16 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase types of avian influenza viruses in addition to three additional influenza A markers (M, PB2 and NS1) [29]. Their strategy was based on probe sequence selection using in silico modeling [30].",

It was used to explore various strategies of sequence selection for its design. The part dedicated to influenza viruses, presented here, was based on consensus sequences specific for one gene. Within the global program, another strategy was explored for the part of the microarray specific for rhabdoviruses. That strategy was based on the use of prototype sequences representative of each of the seven species described in the genus Lyssavirus and chosen within a conserved region of the polymerase gene [31]. Consensus sequences generation was a posteriori used to analyse results. Our strategy presented in this study, uses consensus sequences generated from nucleotide sequence alignments to determine the sequences to be tiled. These sequences characterised by a minimum size of 200 bp reduce the number of probes required for tiling yet still covering the wide diversity of influenza virus strains. To validate our approach, influenza viruses from different host origins, isolated over a period of about 50 years, were chosen. The DNA microarray not only demonstrated its ability to identify the type and subtype of influenza viruses but also had a strong discriminatory power at the level of viral variants.",

Four genes including PB2, M, HA and NA were chosen in order to type and subtype influenza viruses. Different strategies for selecting the region to resequence were adopted depending on the particular gene. Characteristics of the sequences tiled on the microarray are detailed in Table 1. Firstly, one partially conserved sequence of 218 bp covering the majority of influenza M segments, routinely employed in medical diagnostics, was used for genus identification, namely Influenzavirus A, B and C. Secondly, almost one hundred sequences of PB2 genes covering a large spectrum of influenza A viruses and hosts were selected from the GenBank database. Five typical PB2 sequences representative of the diversity of PB2 sequences over a long period of time and for different host reservoirs were finally retained. The five selected sequences are described in Table 1. The strategy adopted for the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) genes involved the design of consensus sequences for the H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9 genes and the N1, N2 and N7 genes. We have restricted the number of studied molecular subtypes of HA and NA in order to make the confirmation of our hypothesis more straightforward and demonstrative without aiming to cover the whole set of serotypes. The HA and NA subtypes chosen to be tiled on the microarray are shared by all the human viruses and highly pathogenic avian viruses, and the HAs are further distributed into phylogenetic groups that gather all the 16 serotypes [32]. For each major HA and NA gene, sequences of influenza A virus were selected from different hosts including horses, pigs, humans and birds.",

All samples were viral isolates, propagated either in embryonated chicken eggs or in MDCK cell cultures. They were chosen from sufficiently distant points in time to cover a large diversity of influenza viruses, especially for human and swine viruses, which were subject to major antigenic drift over the years. Avian strains were derived from cloacal samples collected from ducks in Baie de Somme, Marquenterre (France) in 2007. RNA extracts were amplified by WTA (Whole Transcriptome Amplification) and hybridised on the resequencing microarray (see Methods section). Results are summarised in Table 2. Nucleotide sequences were determined from the fluorescent signals as previously described [33] and compared with sequences in GenBank by BLASTN analysis, to identify and subtype influenza virus strains. Results for the highest hit scores were taken as strain identification. After hybridisation of WTA amplified material on the DNA microarray, all samples were positive for the presence of influenza A virus with a minimum call rate of 41% for the M gene and a call rate ranging from 35.5 to 97.4% for the PB2 gene, which is the percentage of bases determined by the resequencing algorithm. Subtypes of the different strains were identified with HA and NA sequences, giving a call rate ranging from 48.5% to 100%. Time ranges were obtained from BLASTN analysis. The sequences showing the highest alignment score were considered and duplicated sequences representing different isolates of the same strain were eliminated. The time range indicated the oldest isolate with high homology provided by the BLASTN algorithm and the most recent one. The median was calculated based upon the sequences showing the highest alignment scores (see Methods section).",

Three major influenza A virus subtypes are currently circulating in swine worldwide, but the origins and the antigenic and genetic characteristics of these swine influenza viruses differ with continents or regions of the world. A/swine/Gent/7625/99 (H1N2) virus is the result of a multiple reassortment involving a swine influenza virus with avian-influenza-like internal segments and human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses isolated in 1994 [35]. BLASTN analysis for H1N2 swine virus reflected this multiple reassortment with blasted sequences originating from human, avian and swine hosts (data not shown). Between 1983 and 1985, swine H3N2 viruses appeared in Italy. They contained avian-like internal genes and HA and NA genes from human H3N2 viruses [36]. In BLASTN analysis, the vast majority of the sequences sorted by the algorithm for glycoprotein segments were from human or swine origins only. All equine influenza virus strains were identified and subtyped with the DNA microarray, with a minimum call rate of 48.5%. Medians were often heterogeneous and far from the original strain. This is probably due to (i) the paucity of equine influenza virus sequences available in the databases, (ii) the limited genetic evolution of those viruses leading to equivalent result scores after BLASTN analysis, (iii) the fact that HA and NA sequences tiled on the microarray were shorter than PB2 sequences, due to their extreme genetic diversity in influenza A viruses. For the H3N8 viruses, recent sequences corresponded to avian strains, outlining the fact that H3N8 equine viruses were reassortants between avian viruses and equine H7N7 viruses which have not been isolated in horses for more than 20 years.",

In order to confirm subtyping of the different viruses, primers were designed based upon resequencing sequences reconstructed by the microarray and used for RT-PCR (see additional file 1). Amplified products were cloned and analysed by classical sequencing. Sequencing results confirmed the subtyping by the DNA microarray of the 3 viral strains isolated from cloacal samples. Time ranges showed that the viral strains isolated in the environment are recent, except for the H1 gene of strain 223 (Table 2). The evolutionary rate of influenza viruses in the natural avian host is believed to be slower than in mammals, and this could explain the above result. Sequences were analysed with the BLASTN program and results with highest scores are represented in Table 3. The majority of the \"classical\" sequences were identical to those found after BLASTN analysis of sequences generated by the DNA microarray. The level of sequence information generated by the DNA resequencing microarray is sufficient and equivalent to that obtained by classical sequencing.",

The avian H3N2 virus isolated from the environment was identified and characterised as having an H3 consensus sequence different from that obtained for human H3N2 viruses. Recently, we have tested the novel human A(H1N1) pandemic virus of swine origin, derived from multiple reassortments, with the DNA microarray and BLASTN analysis determined the segment origin for the PB2, H1 and N1 genes, which were derived from avian, classical swine virus and avian-like swine virus, respectively [38]. Our data validated the strategy of using consensus sequences with all of the serotypes tested, including H1, H3, H7 (this paper) and H5 [38] (H9 and H2 were not tested, because not available in the laboratory) and N1, N2 and N7 (this paper). The simple design strategy used in this study, based on global alignements covering the whole gene, does not need the use of a specific algorithm as the one used for the TessArray RPM-Flu resequencing microarray which was based on probe sequence selection [29]. The consensus sequences which allowed to considerably limiting the number of probes tiled on the non-specialised PathogenID v2.0 microarray would allow the determination of differential diagnosis with other respiratory viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), SARS-CoV, and also potential co-infections, which is not possible with microarrays entirely dedicated to influenza viruses. The use of WTA amplification provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random RT-PCR [14] which is compatible with the use of the PathogenID v2.0 resequencing microarray for clinical samples. Furthermore, the use of random hexamers and multiple displacement amplification allowed detection of a new virus which can not be amplified with usual specific primers as shown by the study on the last novel H1N1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic [38]. However, the DNA microarray failed to detect the N8 gene from H3N8 equine viruses. Here, it will be useful to tile other genes on the next generation microarray, including all HA and NA subtypes or the PB1 gene, which has often been involved in reassortment in past pandemics. In this way, one could detect as many reassortants as possible thereby impacting on public health measures.",

One-Step RT-PCR was performed with 25 \u03bcl reaction volume. The extracted RNA sample (5 \u03bcl) was added to RT-PCR mixture (20 \u03bcl) consisting of 1X Reaction Mix (a buffer containing 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO4), 0.5 \u03bcl of SuperScript(tm) II RT/Platinum(r) Taq Mix, 0.4 \u03bcM primer Forward, 0.4 \u03bcM primer Reverse, 0.2 U/\u03bcl of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor and nuclease-free water. The RT and PCR were carried out with following steps: RT at 45\u00b0C for 30 min; 55\u00b0C for 15 min, 94\u00b0C for 5 min, then PCR cycle 1-30, 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 45\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec; final extension, 72\u00b0C for 5 min.",
