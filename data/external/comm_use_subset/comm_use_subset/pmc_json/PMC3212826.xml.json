EV71 infection predominantly leads to hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children under 6 years old [2,3]. Most of the EV71 infections resolve spontaneously; however, EV71 infection occasionally causes neurological complications that can lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death [4-7]. Outbreaks of EV71 have erupted around the world in the past decades and mainly appearing in the countries and regions of Asia in recent years [8-10]. Hundreds of cases involving lethal complications have been reported in each outbreak [2,11,12], and the epidemic is still prevalent in Asia [13].",

            "text": "Previous studies indicated that lycorine can inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells [30,31] and in cell-free systems in which protein synthesis is catalysed by eukaryotic ribosomes [32]. However, there have debates on which step of protein synthesis is blocked by lycorine. Jimenez et al. has indicated that lycorine halts protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by blocking the peptide bond formation [31]. Lycorine was shown to prevent the coupling of the N-acetyl leucyl residue from UACCA-acetyl leucine to puromycin, and it was therefore postulated that these compounds inhibited the transpeptidation reaction [32]. In contrast, it has been reported that lycorine affects the termination but not the elongation nor the cleavage of the polyprotein [33]. The single large coding region of the EV71 genome is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (5' and 3' UTR). The coding region is translated as a single polyprotein, which is then processed by viral proteases to yield mature viral proteins including the capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D) [34]. We investigated the inhibitory mechanism of lycorine on EV71 replication by detecting the step of the viral life cycle that was initially blocked post drug treatment and found that the repression effect of lycorine on the synthesis of viral proteins located at C terminal of the polyprotein was earlier and more substantial than its effect on viral proteins located at N terminal of polyprotein (Figure 3); therefore, we concluded that the drug inhibits the elongation of the viral polyprotein during protein synthesis. The imbalanced synthesis of viral proteins could interrupt the package of the virus. And the inhibition of 3D protein could result in the reduction of replication of virus, as the 3D protein is the RNA polymerase of EV71 [35].",

            "text": "In contrast to its other wide range of biological effects, lycorine is suspected to be the source of Amaryllidaceae poisoning in humans and animals [36]. Empirical data from previous reports suggests that lycorine may be responsible for symptoms such as nausea and emesis [22]. High concentration of lycorine-induced apoptosis of RD cells was observed in this study (Figure 2), which indicated that lycorine is noxious to eukaryotic cells. However, lycorine could inhibit the replication of EV71 at very low concentration and the IC50 for inhibiting EV71 infection was approximately 100-fold lower than the CC50 on RD cell, suggesting that it had potential application in the clinical treatment of EV71 infection. This assumption was verified by evaluating the antiviral effect of lycorine in a mouse model, as the survival rate of 0.4 mg/kg lycorine-treated mice was significantly enhanced compared to the control mice upon lethal EV71 infection (Figure 4A), and the alleviation of acute symptoms and reduction of pathological changes in the muscles of lycorine-treated mice were achieved by inhibiting the replication of virus (Figure 4, 5, 6). The surviving mice in the lycorine treated group recovered within 14 days. Furthermore, lycorine treatment did not cause any obvious side effects in the mice at the tested doses (data not shown).",

In previous studies, treatment with several drug candidates, including ribavirin, bovine lactoferrin, siRNA and type I interferon, were able to enhance the survival rates of infected mice to 18%-100% [14-17]. However, because the infection doses of virus and strains were different in these experiments, it is difficult to compare the activity of these drugs, but we observed that the efficiency of lycorine against EV71 infection was better than ribavirin, as shown in IC50 determination (Figure 1A) and evaluation by a mouse model (Figure 4A). Furthermore, as most of the EV71 infections were self-limited and did not cause severe complications in patients, self-resolved EV71 infection model, in which the infected mice develop paralysis at 5 dpi and the symptoms were basically self-limited within 8 dpi. As we expected, lycorine treatment was able to protect the infected-mice from paralysis symptoms by inhibiting EV71 replication (Figure 7). Meanwhile, we found that lycorine could also inhibit the infectivity of three other EV71 strains (these strains were isolated from clinical specimens from different regions of mainland China and belong to the C4 genotype) on RD cells (data not shown); which demonstrates that lycorine has an effective antiviral spectrum against EV71 strains prevalent in mainland China.",
