With the population in Europe aged 85 years and above projected to rise from 14 million currently to 19 million by 2020 and to 40 million by 2050, and the expectation that more than 30% of European citizens will be aged over 60 years by 2050, the proportion of the population in countries at all levels of development which requires long\u2010term care is only set to increase dramatically over the coming decades.2\n",

The development of universally applicable guidance on the prevention and control of influenza and other respiratory viruses in LTCFs is difficult due to the huge variation in the size of facilities, patient characteristics, the intensity of care provided and resources available. Although some countries have produced guidance on IPC for use specifically in LTCFs,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 most have not. To help fill this gap, the WHO has recently published a best practice guidance document to support managers of LTCFs in the 53 WHO European Region Member States and which can be tailored according to national and local circumstances12 ( http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/330225/LTCF-best-practice-guidance.pdf?ua=1).",

A review of 206 published infectious outbreaks in elderly care facilities across 19 countries over 40 years identified 37 different pathogens, but influenza viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks (23%).17 In the 49 outbreaks caused by influenza, the median attack rate in residents was 33% (range 4\u201094%), and 23% (range 3\u201058%) among staff, with a median case\u2010fatality rate for residents of 6.5% (range 0\u201055%).

In a retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents in 381 nursing homes across three seasons, estimated for the 63% of residents with comorbid conditions, influenza contributed to approximately 28 hospitalisations, 147 courses of antibiotics and 15 deaths per 1000 person\u2010years annually; a higher burden than residents without comorbid conditions but in whom there were still seven hospitalisations, 99 excess antibiotic prescriptions and six deaths per 1000 residents annually.16 Increased age itself is a recognised risk factor for serious influenza infection. A systematic review evaluating populations at risk of severe influenza\u2010related illness found that for seasonal influenza (H3N2 or type B), there was raised risk of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR] 4.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74 to 12.41) and risk of death (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.70) among elderly people (>65 years) compared with non\u2010elderly people.19 Modelling studies suggest that the burden on the health services is particularly onerous for those aged 75 and above, with an estimated 36% of all influenza\u2010attributable respiratory hospitalisations and 74% of all influenza\u2010associated deaths occurring in this age group in the UK over 13 seasons,20 and accounting for 52% of total hospital bed occupancy and 69% of excess bed days occupancy in England over a similar number of seasons.21\nKey Points 1\nLTCFs are susceptible to seasonal influenza outbreaks, which may be explosive and with high attack rates in residents.Written IPC policies, vaccination policies for residents and staff, provision of ongoing staff IPC training and the facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices should be in place throughout the year.Although influenza vaccine efficacy is lower in the elderly and in the presence of comorbidities compared to healthy younger adults, vaccination of LTCF residents remains a major public health tool and is recommended.Vaccination of LTCF staff is recommended and should be encouraged. Although evidence for a protective effect of HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly is weak, HCW vaccination can help to protect themselves, maintain the workforce during an outbreak and act as a barrier to transmission of infection to the vulnerable.\n\n",

The observed variability might be explained by HCWs being at higher risk of asymptomatic or subclinical infection, indicating that HCWs may act as an infective pool to transmit influenza to frail elderly people. Furthermore, a study of HCWs in an acute hospital during a mild epidemic season, found that 23% had serological evidence of new influenza infection during the season, implying a potential transmission risk to patients as between 28% and 59% of infected workers had subclinical infections and continued to work.57 Although the role of asymptomatic people and those with only mild symptoms in spreading influenza is uncertain, HCWs often continue to work despite having symptoms and may act as a source of infection to those in their care.58, 59, 60 Nursing home aides in particular have been shown in one Swedish study to be the occupational group at significantly greatest risk of continuing to work despite the feeling that, in the light of their perceived state of health, they should have taken sick leave.61 However, in reality the employment status of many LTCF staff is often precarious and taking unpaid sick leave may result in adverse economic consequences.",

A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in people 65 years or over, with separate analyses for those living in nursing homes and community dwelling older people,66 concluded that for elderly people living in closed communities vaccination may be slightly to moderately more effective than no vaccination at preventing influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) (24% [95% CI 12\u201034%]), pneumonia (47% [95% CI 34\u201057%]), hospitalisation (49% [19\u201068%]), overall mortality (60% [95% CI 23\u201079%]) and mortality from influenza or pneumonia (54% [95% CI 37\u201067%]), although no significant protective effect against proven influenza was found. A later systematic review67 also found that vaccination may have a small significant protective effect against pneumonia (37% [95% CI 18\u201053%]) and mortality from influenza and pneumonia (34% [95% CI 10\u201053%]), in institutionalised older adults \u226560 years; also a trend towards protection against ILI (21% [95% CI \u22123 to 39%]). The authors did not address the effectiveness of vaccination against all\u2010cause mortality and, due to an insufficient number of studies, were unable to perform meta\u2010analyses for laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza or hospitalisation. The quality of the evidence is very weak in both reviews and does not definitively answer the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older people living in LTCFs. In particular, selection bias may occur by targeting the frail for immunisation; conversely people who are particularly frail or close to death may not receive vaccine resulting in overestimation of the effectiveness of vaccine on mortality (healthy recipient effect).68, 69 Although there is some indirect evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalisation, pneumonia and death from studies which have controlled for multiple confounders and compared summer and winter mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated elderly people,70, 71 accurate proof of IVE requires adequately powered studies using laboratory\u2010confirmed outcomes, in which confounders are controlled for and which comprehensively monitor morbidity and mortality.72\n",

Another systematic review81 found a significant reduction in ILI and all\u2010cause mortality in residents associated with vaccination of HCWs (42% and 29% reductions respectively), but no significant reductions for laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza or all\u2010cause hospitalisations. Overall the authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the different outcomes, and concluded that HCW influenza vaccination can enhance patient safety. Protective effects of HCW vaccination against non\u2010specific outcomes may be an indication of unaccounted cluster biases, such as differences in handwashing or other IPC precautions and warrants further investigation.82 Evidence from observational and modelling studies suggests a likely proportionate effect of HCW vaccination coverage on patient protection, although no clear threshold for HCW vaccine uptake above which the protective effect on residents increases substantially has been established.83, 84, 85, 86, 87\n",

Therefore, it remains a biologically plausible intervention to provide individual protection to the HCW, act as a barrier against spread of infection and to help reduce the risk associated with influenza infection and prevent staff absenteeism. However, poor vaccine uptake by HCWs has been well documented. In Europe, coverage of HCWs (including those working in LTCFs) varies between countries and is generally much lower than for other vaccination targeted groups, ranging from 9.5% to 75% with a median vaccination coverage rate of 28.6%.65 In the United States, vaccination rates of 50\u201070% have been reported for LTCF workers,78, 90, 91 with coverage consistently lower than among staff working in hospital settings.91 Reasons given for declining vaccination include fear of side effects, lack of concern or perception of risk, doubts about vaccine efficacy, lack of availability or inconvenient delivery of vaccine, avoidance of medications and dislike of injections.92 Although mandatory vaccination is effective if it can be implemented,93 it is not legally enforceable in all countries and settings, and infection rates after the implementation of mandatory vaccination have not been studied. The United States Department of Health and Human Services advocates a 90% HCW vaccination rate by 2020 but as yet there have been no RCTs of transmission with very high HCW vaccination rates.33 Data suggest that other interventions such as easier access to vaccine, educational activities, reminders and organisational changes can increase uptake in proportion to the number of interventional components, although most studies have only evaluated their effect on a short\u2010term basis whereas long\u2010term intervention programmes will be necessary to demonstrate a sustainable effect on uptake.94 To address low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in priority target groups, a project called TIP FLU was initiated in 2013 by the WHO Influenza and other Respiratory Pathogens programme.

Furthermore, other underlying conditions may impair residents\u2019 abilities to verbalise their symptoms. This may impede the early implementation of control and treatment strategies.99 The precise definition of ILI may vary from country to country; the WHO global surveillance case definition of ILI is an acute respiratory infection with measured fever \u226538\u00b0C and cough and onset within the last 10 days,100 whereas that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) definition is sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of four systematic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath).3, 101\n",

Meta\u2010analysis of observational studies indicated a potential effect of oseltamivir in reducing hospitalisation in the general population (all ages) compared with no antiviral (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.89]), but no significant effect was found for inhaled zanamivir (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.37 to 1.18]).117 Individual patient data meta\u2010analysis from 29 234 people of all ages hospitalised with 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza showed that deaths were reduced when treated with NAIs within 48 hours of onset (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.93]), supporting the use of early NAI treatment in those who require hospitalisation.119 A reduction in mortality risk for patients receiving oseltamivir compared to those not given antivirals was also noted in a meta\u2010analysis of three observational studies (OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.43]) but the quality of evidence was low, and related only to oseltamivir.117\n",

With an increasingly elderly population, the demand for LTCFs is likely increase over the coming years. Many basic and clinical questions remain unanswered about the transmission, prevention and treatment of influenza in these institutions and further evidence is needed to determine which interventions, or combination of interventions and hygiene practices are most efficacious in these settings. Although vaccination for residents and staff forms the cornerstone of preventive influenza policy in LTCFs, and vaccine coverage is high among residents in some countries, currently available vaccines are less effective in older people and those with comorbidities. Vaccination coverage among HCWs caring for residents of LTCFs is generally much lower than for those in other priority groups and efforts are required to improve this to protect the vulnerable, the individual HCW and the workforce. Although further studies of the efficacy of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis in LTCF setting are required, available data suggest that antivirals should be used early during the course of infection for treatment of residents and considered for prophylaxis during suspected or confirmed influenza outbreaks to reduce secondary transmission. The prevention and control of influenza in LTCFs requires a multifaceted approach; vaccination and antiviral policies form an important part of this, but strong managerial leadership, outbreak planning, and a well\u2010trained, educated and engaged workforce are pivotal to the successful implementation of IPC policies.",
