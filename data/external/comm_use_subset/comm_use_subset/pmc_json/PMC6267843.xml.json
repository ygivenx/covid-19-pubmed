A high burden of dental caries was evident among children in Saudi Arabia with an estimated prevalence of approximately 80% [2]; other high-risk areas include Latin America, Middle East, and South Asia [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the need to reduce global burden of dental caries in attaining optimal health. Consequently, in the year 2003, WHO and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) World Dental Federation set global goals for oral health in 2020 to guide planners and policy makers to improve the status of oral health in their populations [4]. Unfortunately, knowledge gaps with respect to the availability of baseline data on oral health and population-specific key modifiable factors of dental caries restrict the ability of many developing nations and semi-developed countries, including Saudi Arabia to attain the goals set by WHO. In addition, competing interests in health care funding warrant prioritizing the associated factors to better direct public health mitigation efforts.",

Moreover, modification of socioeconomic factors requires time-consuming macro level changes. In contrast, individual factors, such as child oral health behaviors, child feeding practices, and dietary habits that play a role in cariogenesis, could be targeted for modification by directing the limited resources to primary school children. Prior evidence illustrates the importance of adopting good oral health behaviors such as regular brushing of teeth, using mouthwash, and flossing teeth in reducing the disease burden and attaining optimal oral health [10]. Similarly, the role of sugary foods (e.g., candies) in cariogenesis was also well established [11]. However, the relative significance of aforementioned oral behavioral factors on cariogenesis compared to other host factors could vary significantly in different populations owing to cultural and behavioral practices.",

Caries status in the crown of primary teeth was assessed using decayed (d), missing (m), and filled (f) teeth (dmft) index [2, 13]; teeth missing (m) or filled (f) contributed to the overall dmft score only if they were missing or filled because of caries.

It should be noted that factors representing low socioeconomic status, such as low level of maternal education, low family income, and lack of dental insurance, were associated with a minimum of fourfold increased dental caries experience. Child oral health practices, such as failure to brush teeth at least once a day, failure to start brushing on or before a child attained 2 years of age, and visiting dentist for symptomatic treatment, were associated with dental caries experience in children. Children habituated to sleeping with bottle in mouth experienced 4.4-fold higher dental caries compared to children not practicing this habit (aOR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.4\u201313.4). In addition, lack of mixed feeding and consuming two or more sugary snack items between meals were predominantly associated with dental caries experience (p < 0.05). Dietary habits, such as less consumption of fresh fruits and frequent consumption of soft drinks and flavored milk, were significantly associated with dental caries with an odds ratio of 11.6, 5.3, and 7.7, respectively.

This notion was further supported by the relatively stronger associations observed between individual factors and dental caries experience in our study. In contrast, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from developing nations demonstrated the dominant role of socioeconomic factors in dental caries\u2019 experience [18, 27\u201329]. The risk profile of dental caries among children in Saudi Arabia appears to follow the theme in developed world, where oral health behavioral practices and dietary habits were relatively more important [30]. However, efforts directed at improving socioeconomic status should be continued, owing to evidence from the present study and prior studies that identified maternal education and family income as consistent associated factors for dental caries [16, 17, 27, 28]. In addition, the availability of dental coverage in medical insurance was associated with dental caries. Although literary evidence was inconsistent in Saudi Arabia [16], the alarming proportion of children (77%) that lacked dental coverage in medical insurance warrant further attention.",

An overwhelming majority of children started brushing after 2 years (82%, 95% CI 78.6\u201385.1%) in the present study, consistent with late adoption of brushing observed in previous studies in Saudi Arabia [20, 34] and in Philippines [35]. However, the higher risk of dental caries observed uniquely among children who started brushing late at 3 or 4 years, in our sample, warrant further investigation. Particularly, future studies could evaluate the possible role of cultural habit of using chewing stick (Miswak) for cleaning teeth on better outcome observed among children starting brushing at ages 5\u20136 compared to those starting brushing at 3 or 4 years in Saudi Arabia. Given the importance of brushing teeth regularly and mouthwash use in maintaining good oral hygiene and preventing dental caries [10], and lower prevalence of these habits observed in our study, detailed investigation of various brushing practices (e.g., use of fluoridated/non fluoridated toothpaste, and use of chewing stick for cleaning teeth), and other oral hygiene practices (e.g., use of fluoride containing mouthwash) among primary school children in Saudi Arabia is necessary.

The problem was even worse among younger children in Saudi Arabia; a mere 11% of children visited dentist for regular checkup on their first visit [20]. This dangerous trend might have prevented patients from availing sound advice on preventive oral health practices, thereby contributing to high prevalence, delayed recognition, and management of dental caries in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, Saudi children would benefit from publicly funded school-based dental screening programs that aid in timely detection and management of dental and other oral health problems. In addition, regular dental screening programs targeted at school children have an added benefit of realizing cost savings due to reduced need for advanced dental care [36].",

Children in our study that were never breast-fed had higher risk of caries, which was consistent with existing literature [49\u201351]. Breast milk by itself was not cariogenic [52], but the reported cariogenicity of certain infant formulas [53] and a higher risk associated with practice of breast feeding until late infancy (> 12 months - OR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.35\u20132.95) [54] should not discourage the practice of mixed feeding until the emergence of new evidence. Interestingly, children in our study that were exclusively breast-fed also experienced higher risk of caries, rendering support to the practice of mixed feeding. As noted in previously published literature [54], it is possible that the practice of breast feeding until late infancy could have played a role in excess risk observed in Saudi children; however, further research based on a larger sample is warranted to confirm our findings and determine the role of duration of exclusive breast feeding on caries risk among children in Saudi Arabia.",

Incidentally, our study contributed towards ever increasing evidence for the association between dental caries and sodas (or soft drinks) [58\u201360].

For example, we would expect a more accurate recollection of tooth brushing habits and child feeding practices that were routine activities performed in the recent past; collection of information on flavored milk, a recent trend in Saudi Arabia, serves as an example for current themes. The study sample was restricted to 6\u20138-year-old male primary school children in Riyadh city of Saudi Arabia, which warrants caution in generalizing the results to the entire country; however, given the cultural homogeneity and urbanity of the area, we would expect our estimates to be relevant to general population.
