            "text": "Saururaceae, a member of the paleoherbs, is an ancient family with six species in four genera, Anemopsis, Gymnotheca, Houttuynia and Saururus\n[1]. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Yuxingcao in Chinese) is the only species in the genus Houttuynia\n[2], [3]. It is distributed mainly in the central, southeastern and southwestern regions of China, and extends to Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, where it grows in moist, shady places [4]. H. cordata is an important traditional medical herb native to China and other Asian countries [5], [6]. It plays a unique role in improving the immune system of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7], [8]. Extracts of H. cordata have diverse pharmacological effects including anticestodal [9], antibacterial [10], [11], antiviral [12]\u2013[15], anticancer [16], [17], antioxidant [18], [19], antiallergenic [20], [21], anti-inflammatory [22]\u2013[24], antimutagenic [18] and anti-obesity [25] activities. H. cordata is also consumed as a vegetable in China for its special aroma. Although H. cordata is of high medicinal and nutritional value, there are no genomic resources for this non-model genus. This lack of genomic information has become a limitation for extensive and intensive research on this important traditional medical herb.",

            "text": "Previous studies on this plant have mainly focused on cultivation techniques [26], [27], its physiological and biochemical properties [28], [29], its genetic relationships and the diversity among H. cordata germplasm collections from different places [4], [30], [31], and its pharmacological effects [7]\u2013[25]. To date, few gene sequences or novel genes have been reported on this species, although much effort has been devoted to cloning key genes. RNA-Seq, which is based on next generation sequencing, is a high throughput technology that has great advantages in examining the fine structure of a transcriptome [32]. When no genome sequence is available, transcriptome sequencing provides an effective way to obtain large amounts of sequence data [33]. RNA-Seq has been widely used in many organisms to obtain mass sequence data for transcriptional analysis, gene discovery and molecular marker development [34]\u2013[36]. The genetic relationships and diversity among H. cordata germplasm collections have been investigated mostly using AFLP [37], ISSR [4], PCR-RFLP [30] and RAPD markers [31]. No simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been reported in H. cordata. Compared with other types of molecular markers, SSR markers have many advantages, such as simplicity, effectiveness, abundance, hypervariability, reproducibility, codominant inheritance, and extensive genomic coverage [38]. Because of the lack of effective molecular markers, marker-assisted selection and molecular breeding of H. cordata has lagged behind other medicinal plants such as Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen [39], Gastrodieae elata Blume [40], and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. [41]. Thus, a rapid, low-cost and effective approach is required to develop SSRs molecular markers for H. cordata.",

Although the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) technology is often used for transcriptome analysis of non-model organisms, it is more expensive than the Illumina technology [45]. De novo assembly of short reads without a known reference is considered difficult [46], but de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads has received attention [47]. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy for de novo assembly of a transcriptome using short reads for a non-model medicinal plant, H. cordata, for which sequence data is very limited in the public databases at present. We showed that assembly program parameters and sequence quality have a significant effect on the assembly output. Although the length of contigs were often less than 500 bp, the Illumina sequencing solution was reliable. such as the average contig size of sesame was less than 200 bp [48], whitefly was only 40 bp [49], sweetpotato was 202 bp[50]. Compared with these reports, the assembled contigs in this study was quite long (253 bp). This suggested that the coverage was relatively high. Greater N50 and average lengths are considered indicative of a better assembly. Here, the N50 length of the unigenes was 1,051 bp and the average length was 679 bp, which suggests that the relatively short reads from Illumina paired-end sequencing for this non-model organism have been effectively and accurately assembled.",

The 63,954 unigenes produced here may be useful for further research into H. cordata functional genomics. Of the H. cordata unigenes, 39,982 (62.52%) showed homology to sequences in the Nr database. Comparatively, in Epimedium sagittatum\n[51], whitefly [49], sweet potato [50] and sesame [48], only 38.50%, 16.20%, 46.21% and 54.03% of the unigenes, respectively, had homologs in the Nr database. The average unigene length in our database was 679 bp, compared with 246, 266, 581 and 629 bp, respectively, in the four studies mentioned above. The higher percentage of hits found in this study was partially a result of the increased number of long sequences in our unigene database; the results for whitefly [49] and sesame [48] support this conclusion. Homologs in other species were not found for 18.3% of the unique sequences. Specifically, only 29.28% of the unigenes shorter than 300 bp showed matches, meaning that 70.72% produced no hits (Fig. 3). These shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain, or they may contain a known protein domain but the query sequence is too short to show sequence matches, resulting in false-negative results. Additionally, little genomic and transcriptomic information is currently available for H. cordata, and consequently, many H. cordata lineage-specific genes might not be included in current databases.",

One of the main reasons for this was the lack of a genome sequence or transcriptome information for H. cordata. Our results have resolved this problem and enabled development of SSR markers for this species. In the present study, 4,800 perfect microsatellites exceeding 12 bp were identified from the H. cordata dataset, and 119 motif sequence types were identified. If mono-nucleotide repeats were excluded, di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant type, followed by tri- nucleotide repeats, which is consistent with previous reports [54]\u2013[57]. The fact that the most abundant di- and tri-nucleotide motifs were AG/TC and AAG/TTC, respectively, was also coincident with previous reports on other species of plants [54]\u2013[56].",

We obtained 39,982 sequences and demonstrated some important features of the H. cordata transcriptome through gene annotation and KEGG pathway analysis. In addition, we identified reliable genetic markers in the form of 4,800 SSRs. Fifty primer pairs were randomly selected to detect polymorphism among 30 H. cordata accessions, and 43 (86%) of these primer pairs successfully amplified fragments, revealing abundant polymorphisms. The SSR markers developed in this study can be used for construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps and to perform gene-based association analyses in H. cordata. This is the first application of Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to investigate the whole transcriptome of H. cordata and to assemble RNA-seq reads without a reference genome. This study will provide useful resources and markers for functional genomics and proteomics research on H. cordata in future.",

Thirdly, the reads with more than 10% Q<20 bases were also removed. De novo transcriptome assembly was carried out with the short reads assembly program in the Trinity software(Release-20120608) [42]. Contigs were created by combining reads that had a certain length of overlap. The reads were then mapped back to the contigs; with paired-end reads we were able to detect contigs from the same transcript as well as the distances between the contigs. The contigs were connected using the Trinity software to get sequences that could not be extended at either end. Such sequences were defined as unigenes. These unigenes were further processed by sequence splicing and redundancy removal using the TGICL software(Version 2.1) [63] to acquire non-redundant unigenes that were as long as possible. After gene family clustering, the unigenes could be divided to two classes. One was clusters, including unigenes that were >70% similar to each other; the other was singletons. In the final step, the sequence direction of the unigenes was determined.",
