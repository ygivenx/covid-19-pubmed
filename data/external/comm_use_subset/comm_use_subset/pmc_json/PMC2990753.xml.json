In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a phase 6 pandemic (the first pandemic in the 21st century and the first in 41 years), when sustained community spread of swine flu occurred in multiple WHO regions [1]. By August 2009, there had been over 209,438 cases of influenza A/H1N1 worldwide, and at least 2,185 deaths had been reported to WHO [2]. In Greece, after a moderate wave during July and August 2009, in which 1,839 cases of A/H1N1 influenza had been confirmed and 1 death had been reported [3], a new wave started in the middle of September, which peaked in the middle of November, with the number of confirmed cases in Greece increasing to 13.899, with 59 deaths by the end of the December, 2009 [4].",

Thus, health care workers (HCWs) assumed a key role, encountering an increasing workload and a perception of increased risk of infection, as in any infectious disease outbreak, and this could possibly affect their psychological well-being.",

HCWs worries and psychological distress over the previous SARS outbreak have been associated with higher job stress, social isolation and health fears [5,6]. Also, among the factors that have been found to be associated with HCWs' psychological distress in previous infectious disease outbreaks were physical and emotional exhaustion because of an overburdened healthcare system [11], rapidly changing medical information and procedures [5,12], media scrutiny [5,12], being a nurse [13], perception of risk to themselves [6], lifestyle affected by the disease outbreak [13], and personal vulnerability [8,9]. It has been also reported that when facing a possibility of an influenza pandemic, a remarkable proportion of HCWs did not go to work, despite a strong sense of duty [14-17].",

No studies, however, have investigated HCWs' worries, concerns or psychological distress at the height of the epidemic of the new strain of influenza virus, A/H1N1. Prompted by this fact, the aim of the present study was to assess HCWs' acute responses to A/H1N1 influenza pandemic as indicated by their degree of concerns and worries over the pandemic, their degree of perceived sufficiency of information concerning A/H1N1 influenza, their intended behavior during the pandemic and whether these factors were associated with psychological distress.",

A letter was sent to each department director, informing them about the study and asking for their permission to distribute the questionnaires to employees in their departments. All contacted departments agreed to participate. In a scheduled meeting with each department's staff, an estimated number of 1000 potential participants were informed about the aims of the study and that participation was voluntary. Blank questionnaires with sealed boxes for collection of responses were placed at various designated work areas in each participating unit. Four hundred sixty-nine subjects (response rate: 46.9%) returned the survey after an informed consent was obtained. The participants were divided into four groups: Medical staff, nursing staff, allied personnel (physiotherapists, social workers, psychologists, etc) and auxiliary staff (domestic services, administration, etc). All the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards on human experimentation (World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration) and were approved by the Ioannina University General Hospital's responsible ethics committee (38/31.8.2009).",

Summary statistics for all variables were calculated. Normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [22]. Chi-square analyses and one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess differences in concerns, worries, degree of worry and perceived sufficiency of information among the groups of the hospital staff. To assess the relationship of worries and degree of worry with intended behaviour, chi-square analyses for categorical data (e.g. worries [Y/N], or intended behaviour [Y/N]) and two-tailed t-tests for continuous data (e.g. degree of worry) were carried out [22]. Univariate comparisons were conducted next to assess variables associated with the degree of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and the HCWs' psychological distress. Chi-square analyses for categorical data (e.g. for testing the relationship of \"psychiatric caseness\" [GHQ < 5/GHQ > 5] with gender [M/F]), two-tailed t-tests for continuous data (e.g. for testing the relationship of degree of worry with gender [M/F]) and Pearson correlations for testing the relationship between continuous variables (e.g. between degree of worry and age) were carried out [22]. To assess the factors most closely associated with HCWs' degree of worry, a multiple regression analysis was carried out with dependent variable the degree of worry and independent variables the major demographic variables and the statistically significant variables of the previous univariate analyses. Missing data of independent variables were treated by mean substitution. Colinearity between independent variables was tested based on variance inflation factors (VIF) and tolerances for individual variables [23]. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the multivariate associations of HCW's psychological distress adjusting for demographic variables. The dichotomous dependent variable was \"total GHQ score\" and the cut-off point was \"5\", as found by receiver-operating characteristics analysis for the GHQ-28 in the Greek population [20]. Selection of independent variables was based on the results of the previous univariate analyses.",

On the other hand, our findings also showed that 20.7% of HCWs presented scores indicating mild to moderate psychological distress, rates similar to those found in a previous study, at times when there was no infectious exposure, when 18.1% of HCWs presented scores indicating mild to moderate psychological distress [25]. In another study of 275 HCWs in the same hospital one year before the infectious outbreak, we found that 21.8% presented scores indicative of mild or moderate psychological distress (unpublished data). These findings indicate that psychological distress is a common experience in HCWs, as also has been suggested by studies in the UK, which have shown that among doctors and nurses, between 28 and 32% scored above the threshold for \"emotional distress\" in GHQ-12 [26-28]. However, despite the fact that HCWs' psychological distress was not elevated in the present study, their degree of worry about the pandemic was an independent correlate of psychological distress (Table 6), indicating that HCWs concerns about the pandemic might contribute to psychological distress. The cross-sectional design of our study prevent us from answering questions about causality, since it is plausible, for instance, that people who are already distressed for reasons not measured in this study are more likely to worry about A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Work satisfaction was also associated with psychological distress (Table 6) but it was not correlated to the degree of worry about the pandemic (Table 5), indicating that the association of work dissatisfaction with psychological distress could be attributed to the chronic stress and burnout that are common in hospital settings and leading contributors to work dissatisfaction [29] rather than the HCW's concerns about the pandemic.",

A greater proportion of nurses and auxiliary staff also worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic compared to medical staff, and their degree of worry was also greater than that of doctors (Table 1). Auxiliary staff expressed the highest level of worry, while being a nurse and/or auxiliary staff was significantly associated with psychological distress. In addition, auxiliary staff considered the consequences of the infection for their health to be greater (Table 1). These findings indicate that assessing and intervening for the psychological impact of the infectious outbreak on HCWs, especially on nurses and auxiliary staff, is of particular importance in planning for the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases. Hospital policies should also take into account auxiliary staff's concerns and worries, and since we found that perceived sufficiency of information was associated with lower degree of worry, hospital managers should try to provide for auxiliary staff's information needs, in order to provide a favourable working environment in times of extreme public health-related concerns, such as the current A/H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

In addition, although fear of stigmatization, in the form of being avoided by family and friends, was observed to be a prominent aspect of many HCWs' experience during SARS [5,7,16,17], this was not the case in the present study, where only 3.8% felt that family and friends avoided them because of their hospital work, and only 6.6% had restricted their social contacts themselves. This is not surprising, since the stigmatization reactions of the public to SARS was founded on the fact that the infection was limited to hospitals, whereas the A/H1N1 infection is a community spread infection for which the risk of infection is fairly evenly distributed across the population. Nevertheless, studies in other countries have shown variable rates of intentional absenteeism due to contagious diseases [12-14,32], depending on the kind of the infection, the different time periods the studies took place, the different survey questions, and the cultural differences or religious beliefs. Our results indicated that most HCWs surveyed considered that it was not possible to avoid their duties in an emergency situation due to the pandemic and they would continue working despite the potential risks (Table 3), a finding consistent with the view that HCWs consider it unethical to abandon their professional responsibilities in order to protect themselves or their families [32,34,35].",

An accurate estimation of the response rate was difficult, because the number of staff who could have been contacted during the 4-week period the study took place is difficult to estimate, given that in September many Greek employees are on vacation. However, the response rate of this study (46.9%) is comparable to other studies investigating HCWs' concerns and distress about infectious outbreaks (for example, 47% in the study of Nickell et al [17], 41.1% in the study of Styra et al [6], or 23.3% in the study of Maunder et al [5]). In addition, comparison of the characteristics of the study sample with the total hospital employees suggested that the study sample is representative of HCWs in our hospital. For example, nurses comprise 46.4% of the hospital staff and 44.6% of the study sample. Despite this, however, we cannot refute the criticism that an underlying response style might have led to our results. We also cannot exclude the possibility that particularly concerned or distressed HCWs were under-represented, as such subjects might be on leave because of their worries about the pandemic and thus unable to join the study. Further methodological limitations are the potential for bias caused by socially acceptable answering resulting in possible underestimated intentional absenteeism rates. Gathering information regarding psychological distress by self-report is a further limitation. Finally, as mentioned earlier, questions about causality cannot be resolved by cross-sectional surveys, and therefore future prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the causal paths of the associations reported regarding HCWs concerns and worries about A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, psychological distress, perceived information and intended behaviour.",
