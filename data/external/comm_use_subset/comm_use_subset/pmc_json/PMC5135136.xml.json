After several rounds of study and discussions among scholars and experts, a core curriculum for the one-year PGY training was formulated. It is now planned according to symptoms or signs, pathology, or disease while the teaching method centers on developing practical care for patients. In addition, clinical teaching and instructional methods are used as supplements to assist students in acquiring related knowledge. However, written tests or assignments are still relied upon to assess the knowledge and effectiveness of the training of doctors-in-training, thus resulting in passive and negative attitudes toward learning.",

With newer developments in digital technology in the 21st century, the classroom teaching skills have become increasingly significant in the education. The continuous innovations in various kinds of digital technology have rendered the current teaching methods much more diverse than those of the past. Teaching methods have undergone immense changes. The \u201cflipped classroom\u201d method that has been widely discussed in recent years is a new teaching method that has attracted the attention of educators worldwide. As its name suggests, the core concept of the flipped classroom is to \u201cflip\u201d the teaching model; it aims to change the traditional teaching model, in which \u201cteachers teach the content of the curriculum while students discuss and practice after lessons and then complete assignments,\u201d to a newer way of attending class, in which \u201cstudents watch videos of the curriculum content prepared by their teachers for them, engage in discussions and practices in class, and then complete their assignments\u201d [5]. In both European and American teachers\u2019 networks, the flipped classroom has been one of the most fervently searched keywords in the past few years and has been implemented in many classrooms today because the maturity of modern science and technology has made the production of teaching videos remarkably easy[6,7]. In addition, there are already significant video resources on YouTube or other websites that can be utilized. Secondary school teachers have proposed an idea that calls for allowing students to watch the teaching videos at home and using class time for exercises, experiments, group discussions, asking questions, summarizing main points, or other in-depth learning activities [8].",

Through continuous development and verification, Fishbein and Ajzen proposed the notion of subjective norms and constructed a complete framework of the four in 1980[10,11]. Thus, the theory of reasoned action maintains that behavioral intention, the decisive factor directly affecting an individual\u2019s actions, will be influenced by \u201cattitude\u201d and \u201csubjective norms.\u201d As for the behavioral influence produced by other factors, they can all indirectly influence behavior through behavioral intention.

This finding highlighted that students learning the curriculum delivered through a flipped classroom generally outperform those learning one delivered through traditional instructional methods [12].

Walvoord and Anderson adopted the assignment-based model, which requires students to write a few questions before class to get feedback for the same in class [30]. Besides this, online interaction, key notes, and problems-recording are all possible methods. If students have not utilized their time before class to better understand and remember teaching contents, it indicates that they have not fulfilled their responsibility; attending class without learning the required knowledge will render in-class group assignments and activities ineffective. In other words, such a student can hardly become an independent and autonomous learner. The real strength of education lies in teaching students to engage in active inquiry and learning rather than the videos; students, in learning independently, must simultaneously be able to search the materials they need and critically review them. The core duty of the flipped classroom is developing a student-centered teaching method, thus the students will control and possess their own learning.",
