In 2016, according to US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry data, one in three patients required at least one course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics to treat a PEx\n1. Exacerbations have a profound impact on the morbidity and quality of life of individuals with CF, and unfortunately PEx outcomes remain suboptimal with poor recovery of baseline lung function following PEx treatment\n2. As a result, efforts are under way within the CF research community to improve the management of these clinically impactful events. The focus of this review is to summarize some of the recent advances that have taken place in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of PEx in CF and to provide direction for future study.",

Varying PEx definitions employed in the CF literature have been a major impediment to research progress and have inherently confounded many of the studies included in this review.

However, this definition has been criticized by some experts in the field because the diagnosis of PEx should be independent of the physician\u2019s decision to treat and pulmonary function testing limits the age range of patients assessed. Some recent pediatric trials have used the PEx definition employed in the Early\nPseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) trial, which consists of one major criterion (decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV\n1] at least 10% from baseline with the previous 6 months; oxygen saturation less than 90% on room air or at least 5% decline from baseline; new lobar infiltrates or atelectasis on chest X-ray; hemoptysis) or two minor symptoms/signs (increased respiratory rate; new or increased adventitial sounds on lung exam; weight loss of at least 5% in the previous 6 months; increased cough; decreased exercise tolerance; increased chest congestion or change in sputum) for at least 5 days or with significant symptom severity\n4.",

In the Standardized Treatment of Pulmonary Exacerbations (STOP) study, a multi-site observational study of patients with CF treated with IV antibiotics in hospital, most patients (85%) described symptoms more than 7 days before admission and nearly one-third (32%) had symptoms more than 21 days beforehand\n5. Less than half (48%) of these individuals received oral antibiotics prior to admission, suggesting that certain patients may have prolonged symptoms in keeping with PEx but, due to delays in diagnosis, are not started on treatment. For these reasons, there has been a recent focus on home monitoring of symptoms and lung function to promote earlier PEx detection and treatment to prevent irreversible lung damage.",

However, a large multi-center randomized trial recently conducted in the US demonstrated that although electronic home monitoring of symptoms and spirometry is feasible and leads to earlier and more frequent diagnoses of PEx compared with usual care, this strategy does not lead to less lung function lost over 1 year\n7. An earlier diagnosis in the home-monitoring arm led to more frequent use of oral (versus IV) antibiotics compared with the usual-care arm (67% versus 43%), and this might have resulted in a higher rate of non-recovery of FEV\n1 % predicted to within 5% of baseline (47% versus 21%) due to a less robust response to oral antibiotic treatment\n7. The authors concluded that identifying PEx earlier may not be sufficient and that future studies must also find better approaches to treatment of exacerbations once they are detected. However, there may still be utility for home monitoring for early PEx detection, particularly for individuals who are poor perceivers of their symptoms, have frequent exacerbations, or reside in rural areas which may delay access to care.",

Furthermore, it should be noted that up to 25% of patients in the STOP trial had their best lung function at the time of PEx diagnosis and therefore a sizeable proportion of patients will be defined as responders even before treatment has started, leading to underestimation of treatment non-response.

Although decreases in bacterial density are observed following anti-microbial treatment, these effects are transient and are poorly predictive of clinical response\n28\u2013\n30. Research has shown that CF airway infections are polymicrobial and that interactions between these microbes may increase or decrease pathogenicity\n31. It is believed by some experts that organisms (such as anaerobes) can interact with the primary pathogen to enhance virulence without a change in density\n31. For example, a recent study evaluating airway bacterial communities with 16S rRNA sequencing found no significant differences in bacterial community diversity or density between paired stable and PEx samples, but there was a change in community structure for a subgroup of patients\n26. Furthermore, the absolute and relative abundance of\nGemella spp. increased in the majority of samples from stable to PEx state, and this was most discriminative of health status (stable versus PEx)\n26.",

There have been no randomized studies examining the duration of IV antibiotics to provide evidence-based recommendations. An observational study that used the US CF Foundation Patient Registry found that FEV\n1 % predicted plateaus by day 10 of treatment and duration of treatment did not influence time until next PEx\n45. More recent retrospective data on the benefits of prolonging antibiotic treatment are conflicting, as a study using the Toronto CF Database found improved outcomes with longer treatment duration (>14 days) whereas a larger study using data from the ESCF did not find a significant association between treatment duration and rate of recovery of FEV\n1 % predicted to within 90% of baseline\n16,\n44. However, as in observational studies of treatment setting, interpretation is limited by indication bias, since patient factors influence treatment duration (patients with lower lung function received longer treatment courses)\n45. A large multi-center study (STOP2) is under way in the US examining IV antibiotic duration since it was identified as the most important research question by CF physicians and patients/caregivers. A divergent trial design is being used and randomly assigns patients to 10 versus 14 days or 14 versus 21 days of IV antibiotics depending on initial symptom and lung function response by day 7\n46.",

In addition, a greater understanding of the sequence of events leading to a PEx at a molecular level is required to improve PEx phenotyping and to guide the development of more targeted treatments.",
