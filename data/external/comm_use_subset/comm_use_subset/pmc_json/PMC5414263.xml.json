            "text": "A promising route in the fight against major disease, such as malaria [1,2], SARS [3], influenza [4], HIV [5] and toxoplasmosis [6], is a novel family of nanoparticle-based vaccines [7,8]. They rely on a special class of self-assembling protein nanoparticles (called SAPNs) that form from multiple copies of a purpose-designed protein chain, functionalized to present epitope antigens on the particle surface. Other approaches to design protein-based nanoparticulate systems have been published by various research groups [9,10]. The architecture of such designs have been described with high accuracy [11,12]. A major challenge in the rational design of such SAPNs lies in the control of their surface structures, as building blocks can self-assemble into a spectrum of different particle morphologies. Starting with the work of Raman et al. [13], several SAPN species have been synthesized, but their structures have not been completely determined in most cases, and nanoparticle populations are usually characterized in terms of the diameter of the particles only. In some studies, the numbers of the protein chains composing the particle have been identified. For example, Kaba et al. [1] and Raman et al. [13] report particles corresponding to assemblies of 60 chains; Pimentel et al. [3] describe SAPNs with 120 chains; Yang et al. [14] discuss species made of 180 and 300 chains; and finally, Indelicato et al. [15] report assemblies of 240, 300, 360 chains. Also smaller assemblies, so-called LCM units containing 15 protein chains have been discussed and reported [13,16]. However, an exhaustive enumeration of all possible nanoparticle morphologies that can arise from multiple copies of a given type of building block is currently lacking. This presents a bottleneck in the prediction of the display of B-cell epitopes on the surface of the SAPNs to render them optimal repetitive antigen display systems.",

Similar to SAPNs, viruses assemble the protein containers that encapsulate their genomes (viral capsids) from multiple copies of a small number of different capsid proteins, in many cases a single type of capsid protein. These proteins typically group together in clusters of two, three, five or six in the capsid surface, akin to the clusters seen in SAPN architectures. Caspar & Klug\u2019s seminal classification scheme of viral architectures [17] relies on a geometric approach, predicting the spectrum of possible virus architectures in terms of the numbers and relative positions of these protein clusters (capsomeres) with reference to spherical surface lattices. This classification has revolutionized our understanding of virus structure, and plays a key role in the interpretation of experimental data in virology. This classification of virus architectures has been developed for particles with icosahedral symmetry and, as such, can be used also for synthetic vaccines based on virus-like particles, but is not suitable to model SAPNs.",

Our approach exploits the geometric relation of SAPN morphologies with fullerene architecture, and further develops tools that have been introduced for fullerene classification. As a result, we present a procedure to classify SAPN morphologies both symmetric and asymmetric, and we deliver a classification for high and low symmetry particles seen in the experiments. In particular, we explicitly determine particle morphologies for symmetric particles formed from up to 360 protein building blocks, as there is experimental evidence that spherical particles up to this size should exist, and these are relevant for vaccine design [1,3,14,15]. Defective nanoparticles are not considered in this work as they require a different mathematical model, and will be the object of future investigation.",

In vaccine design, the PBB helices are functionalized, e.g. via an extension of the trimer-forming helices by viral epitopes as in the case of the SARS HRC1 [3]. Information on the positions of the trimeric coiled coils therefore provides insights into epitope location in the nanoparticle surface. For example, figure 1c illustrates how nanoparticle graphs translate into SAPN morphologies, based on the example of a particle formed from 180 PBBs. It has 36 pentameric and 60 trimeric clusters, with epitope positions marked by black spheres.

In step one, the set V5 of the nanoparticle graph is constructed by placing a vertex at the centre of each face of the fullerene graph F, i.e. by adding the vertices of the dual graph of F to the vertices V \u20323 of the fullerene graph. In step two, each such vertex is connected to those vertices from V \u20323 that are located on the same face, and all edges of the fullerene graph are removed. This yields a bipartite graph N\u2032 with vertices of degree 3 (V \u20323) and vertices of degree either 5 or 6 (V5). Finally, in order to obtain a nanoparticle graph N, removal of vertices from V \u20323 is required so that all vertices in V5 have degree 5. This requires eliminating (colouring) of exactly one vertex of the fullerene graph F for each hexagonal face, and none from the pentagonal faces, which we will refer to as the vertex colouring rule in the following. Such colouring may not be possible or not be unique. A necessary condition for a fullerene graph to result in a nanoparticle graph with N=15m edges via the vertex colouring rule is that the fullerene graphs must have 6m\u22124 vertices, corresponding to the sum of the number of vertices V3 and hexagonal faces x of the nanoparticle graph. We will therefore in the following classify SAPN morphologies, either symmetric or not, starting with fullerene graphs C6m\u22124, that have been classified previously [18\u201320].",

In this construction, a fullerene graph is represented as a superposition of an icosahedral surface (20 equilateral triangular faces) on a planar hexagonal grid such that the icosahedral vertices coincide with centres of the hexagonal tiles (figure 3). The positions of the carbon atoms in the fullerene then correspond to the vertices of the hexagonal tiles that overlap with the embedded icosahedral surface. Denoting one of the icosahedral vertices as O, the construction is fully determined by specifying the location of a second vertex P on the same triangular face in terms of integer coordinates (i,j) in the hexagonal lattice basis e1 and e2. The equilateral triangle with P=(1,0) by construction contains only one vertex of the fullerene graph, i.e. one carbon atom. Denoting the area of this triangle as \u0394, then an equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0) and P=(i,j) has area (i2+ij+j2)\u0394, and therefore contains i2+ij+j2 vertices of the fullerene. Given that the planar net of the icosahedron contains 20 equilateral triangular faces, fullerenes with icosahedral symmetry are only possible if they have 20(i2+ij+j2) vertices. As only fullenene graphs with 6m\u22124 vertices can correspond to nanoparticle graphs with N=15m chains (recall table 1), we obtain the condition\ni2+ij+j2=150(N\u221210).The two possible solutions N=60 and N=360 correspond to isomers with (i,j)=(1,0) or (i,j)=(0,1), and (i,j)=(2,1) or (i,j)=(1,2), respectively. In each case, we construct the planar net and apply the vertex colouring rule. In the first case, the nanoparticle graph has no hexagons and corresponds to the rhombic triacontahedron. In the second case, colouring compatible with icosahedral symmetry is indeed possible and results in two structures that are identical up to helicity (cf. table 2).\n\n",

Up to and including 360 chains, these are N=60 for (\u03b1,\u03b2,td,pd)=(1,1,1,1); N=120 for (0,1,3,2) and (1,0,3,2); N=180 for (0,0,5,3); N=240 for (1,1,6,4); N=300 for (0,1,8,5) and for (1,0,8,5); and N=360 for (0,0,10,6). By table 1, these correspond to fullerenes Cn with n=20,44,68,92,116,140. Note also that, because T is a subgroup of the tetrahedral groups Th and Td, the above restrictions hold also for nanoparticles with higher tetrahedral symmetry. Fullerenes with tetrahedral symmetry can be constructed via the Fowler\u2013Cremona\u2013Steer construction [23], which is based on the superposition of the surface of a polyhedron with tetrahedral symmetry onto a planar hexagonal tessellation as shown in figure 4. The polyhedral surface corresponds to the union of three types of triangles, equilateral and scalene, which are characterized via a quadruplet of integers (i,j,h,k) as follows: the four large equilateral triangles are given as in the Goldberg\u2013Coxeter construction via (i,j), and the four small equilateral triangles by (h,k) (points P and Q in figure 4); the 12 scalene triangles are then implied by the dimensions and positions of these two triangle types. If all edges are of the same length and the angles between the large and small equilateral triangles are 60\u00b0 (which is the case for h=\u2212j and k=i+j), then this construction results in an icosahedral net as in figure 3. In general, the area of the polyhedral surface is 4(i2+ij+j2+h2+hk+k2+3(ik\u2212jh)) times the area of a small equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0) and (1,0). We thus obtain, using table 1, that the corresponding nanoparticle graph with N edges must satisfy the identity\nN=10+10(i2+ij+j2+h2+hk+k2+3(ik\u2212jh)).We construct the planar nets for all tetrahedral solutions above, using the (i,j,h,k) vectors from the Fowler\u2013Cremona\u2013Steer classification (table 2), and check whether the vertex colouring procedure can be applied to obtain a nanoparticle graph. Note that the colouring is not always possible, and that there are cases in which there are different nanoparticles corresponding to the same fullerene. We list all resulting nanoparticle graphs with at least tetrahedral symmetry in table 2 and provide the corresponding atlas in figure 5. We give an explicit example of the full net of a tetrahedral fullerene graph and its associated nanoparticle graph (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2).\n\n",

This defines the epitope density, which in turn is related to the strength of the immune response. Already several decades ago, in their hallmark publication Dintzis et al. [33] related the epitope density to the so-called immunon, a determinant of the strength of the immune response. Based on our results, we can estimate the average distance between trimers and pentamers by a simple density argument. Given a nanoparticle graph N, with N=15m edges, consider the associated graph N\u2032, in which each hexagon is replaced by three rhombs (figure 2), so that N\u2032 has only rhombic faces, specifically 9m\u22126 (by table 1). Assuming that all rhombs are approximately equal, with approximately the same area, shape and sides, the area A of a spherical rhomb on the surface of a sphere of radius r can be estimated as\nA\u223c4\u03c0r29m\u22126.",

The dimension of the central cavity will increase with the number of protein chains per particle. Also, the B-cell epitope will not be located on top of the vertices but rather roughly on top of the individual \u03b1-helical axes. The distance of this axis of the coiled coil \u03b1-helices relative to the trimer and pentamer axes is about 0.65 nm and 0.85 nm for the trimer and pentamer, respectively [34,35].

For instance, in the SARS nanoparticle with N=120 and a helix length of about 7 nm, the distance between epitopes located at trimeric sites would be about 4.6 nm. If the B-cell epitope itself is not coiled-coil, which has a quite extended shape, then the particular dimension of the B-cell epitope will also have to be taken into consideration. If it is a folded protein domain then it has quite likely a roughly spherical shape. The size of a protein like lysozyme is about 3.5 nm. Using a particular SAPN architecture the B-cell epitope can then be placed in an array with a rather precise spacing depending on the lengths of the coiled coil of the SAPN. This gives the vaccinologist a tool to optimize the vaccine for best immune response.",

We have demonstrated previously that a combinatorial analysis of SAPN structures can be an invaluable tool in the interpretation of experimental data. In particular, biophysical methods such as analytical ultracentrifugation can provide information on the numbers of chains N in the particles that occur in the self-assembly process. Combinatorics does then narrow down the spectrum of options to a limited ensemble of particle geometries compatible with this range of chain numbers, and identifies the precise surface structures of the particles in terms of the placements of all protein chains and threefold and fivefold coiled coils. It also offers a glimpse at the complexity of the assembly process in terms of the numbers of different particles that can occur in a given range of chain numbers. In previous work [15], a full classification had not yet been available. It was therefore only possible to identify possible candidates for the particles seen in experiment, but an exhaustive enumeration was not possible.",

It offers for the first time, to our knowledge, insights into the full spectrum of particles of arbitrary size and morphology occurring in an experiment. This exhaustive approach therefore opens up opportunities for the analysis of experimental data that had not been possible before. For example, it is now possible to apply statistical mechanics approaches and construct partition functions describing the outcome of the assembly experiments. These can be used to better understand the assembly process itself in terms of the most likely, dominant assembly pathways. This, in turn, will provide pointers for experimentalists on how to optimize the assembly procedure, e.g. in terms of the yield of desired particle types. The detailed insights into the connectivity of each chain in the nanoparticle surface moreover enable computer reconstructions of the nanoparticles, as in the example in figure 1c. These can then be used to engineer specific architectures by controlling the rigidity of the links and the angle between the coiled coils (an issue not addressed here).",

In particular, our approach links SAPN morphologies with epitope positions, and therefore provides a tool for the identification of SAPN morphologies with optimal properties for vaccine design. However, if the SAPNs are co-assembled from different chains, i.e. if the SAPNs are composed of epitope-decorated units and protein chains lacking epitopes, then the assembly forms will be much more difficult to predict. Depending on the B-cell epitope, chains with epitope may cluster together if there are attracting forces between the B-cell epitopes. Also, we do not exclude the possibility that SAPNs may be formed that have an irregular assembly form of protein chains owing to imperfect propagation of the lattice in all directions. If so, this would lead to chimeric forms of SAPNs with respect to their architecture as described here.",
