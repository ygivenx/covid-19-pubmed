            "text": "Beginning in 2013, outbreaks of new variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused high mortality and morbidity in piglets, leading to great economic losses (Lee 2015). The virus causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration in pigs of all ages, especially suckling piglets (Lee 2015; Song and Park 2012). This highly contagious disease has spread quickly in porcine industries in several countries (Jung and Saif 2015; Lee 2015). Furthermore, PEDV infection causes severe perturbations of gut microbiota, reducing probiotic bacterial abundance, enriching pathogenic bacteria, and even impairing the growth performance of PEDV-surviving pigs (Alvarez et al. 2015; Deping Song et al. 2017). The development of effective protective agents against PEDV infection is urgently needed.",

Our recent studies reported that Lactobacillus species and Clostridium butyricum-fermented probiotics product alleviate diarrhea incidence and reduce the gut pathogens in weaning piglets (Cheng et al. 2019). On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and B. licheniformis\u2013fermented products could increase growth performance and mitigate Clostridium perfringens\u2013induced necrotic enteritis in broilers (Cheng et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2019). Enhancement of nutrient digestibility and Lactobacillus counts of feces by feeding B. subtilis and B. licheniformis has also been reported in pigs (Lan and Kim 2019). It has been demonstrated that B. licheniformis exhibiting antimicrobial activity against pathogens might be due to the production of antibacterial biosurfactants (Lin et al. 2019). Furthermore, our experiment results also demonstrated that B. licheniformis\u2013fermented products exhibit antibacterial activities against Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro (Lin et al. 2019).",

Supernatants were harvested after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. After adjusting the pH value to 2.0 with 6 N HCl for protein precipitation, the precipitates were dried in a freeze dryer after washing twice with distilled water. This B. licheniformis-fermented products (BLFP) was used in animal study. To characterized the BLFP, the surfactin derived from Bacillus subtilis (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) was used as standard substance. The content of BLFP in the fermentative product was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described (Schneider and Marahiel 1998). Briefly, after filtration, samples were subjected to analysis via SPD-10A HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) with a pre-packed LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase was a mixture of 3.8 mM trifluoroacetic acid and 200 ml DDW with 800 ml 100% methanol. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and determined with a UV detector (10A VP, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) at 210 nm.

            "text": "The main antiviral mechanism of BLFP crude extract is thought to be related to its unique biochemical structure that increases membrane permeability to disrupt and lyse microbial membranes (Huang et al. 2006). By performing a direct-virucidal study of BLFP crude extract against PEDV, a ten-fold reduction of the viral titer was able to confirm the directed-antiviral ability of BLFP crude extract. According to our HPLC analysis, a peak of surfactin-like peptide was identified in the BLFP crude extract. Several different potential antiviral mechanisms of biosurfactants have been previously reported (Vollenbroich et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2017). Lipopeptide biosurfactants have been previously suggested to possess probiotic attributes for animal and human use (Schneider 1998; Sen 2010). A previous study demonstrated that the antiviral ability of surfactin from B. subtilis was achieved through competition with the TGEV entry receptor (Wang et al. 2017). The inhibition of viral enzymes such as proton-ATPase that are required for the entry of some viruses into cells by surfactin from B. subtilis (Vollenbroich et al. 1997) has also been reported. It is worth noting that not only did co-cultivation of the surfactin-like peptide in the BLFP crude extract with PEDV-infected Vero cells significantly reduce viral infection and replication in the study, but BLFP crude extract-treated PEDV-infected cells also exhibited an undetectable extracellular viral titer, suggesting that BLFP crude extract may play an important role in reducing the release of virions. These results suggest additional mechanisms of BLFP crude extract against PEDV in Vero cells. Although further study of the antiviral mechanisms of BLFP crude extract is needed in the future, observation of the diverse antiviral activities of BLFP crude extract will lead to further development of this new therapeutic candidate.",

In order to use BLFP as a feed additive for its antiviral properties, assessment of its antiviral and safety profile in pigs is essential. Our results demonstrated that piglets supplemented with BLFP show milder symptoms and have reduced viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological effects and no changes in average daily gain were noted. These results suggest that the biosurfactants at concentrations of 5 kg/ton or less will be very safe in pigs in future applications. In a previous study, it was found that administration of surfactin from B. subtilis at over 500 kg/ton leads to necrosis of hepatocytes in rats (Hwang et al. 2009). In the future, animal experiments using higher dosages of biosurfactants would be necessary to validate its maximal safety dosage.",
