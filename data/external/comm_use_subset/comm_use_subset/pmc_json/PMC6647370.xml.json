CysCts serve general housekeeping functions in all cell types, and specialized roles in differentiated cells. Most have broad substrate acceptance and partially redundant functions. The early view was that cathepsins act only within the catabolic vacuole. However, it is now known that some CysCts can function in the extra-lysosomal and extracellular spaces until inactivated by oxidation or Nature\u2019s inhibitors. Moreover, intra-vacuolar reaction rates can vary markedly in response to endogenous reaction conditions.",

Deletions of various CysCt genes can decrease the progress of diverse pathogenic processes. Conversely, loss of endogenous protease inhibitors can increase these pathogenic processes.

Pharmacological opposition of one or more CysCt activity(s) might have great therapeutic benefits (Kramer et al. 2017).",

All proteases with the CysHis/CysHis(X) catalytic partners share something in common: Zn2+ is a natural inhibitory modulator of their reaction mechanism. Zn2+ forms multi-dentate associations with the thiolate anion of cysteine neighboring the imidazole ring of histidine in many Zn2+ finger proteins, e.g. Cys2 -Zn2+-His2 (Kochanczyk et al. 2015; Kluska et al. 2018). The coordination properties of Zn2+ with Cys-His are flexible; various stoichiometries and stabilities are found: Cysn\u2013Zn2+\u2013Hisn. The bidentate interaction of Zn2+ with 1 Cys(thiolate) neighboring 1 His(imidazole) in catalytic sites is emerging as a major component of Nature\u2019s reaction buffer. Recent evidence suggests that cell Zn2+ homeostasis is interactive with multiple pathways of cell protein degradation (see below section).",

Excessive ongoing proteolysis can lead to decompensated activation of pro-proteases, positive feedback, and necroptosis or apoptosis (see below section). Lesser excesses of intracellular or extracellular activities can be gradually injurious over many years. For some uses, complete inhibition of one or more CysCts might be required, e.g. inhibition of viral or parasite proteases. Importantly, excessive inhibition of various proteolytic pathways can be pathogenic under prolonged administration (Lu et al. 2016; Ketterer et al. 2017). Neuropathic accumulation of denatured proteins is a particular concern. For most purposes, safe inhibition implies a decline from excessive activity toward restoration of non-injurious \u201cnormal\u201d activity.",

Many redox interactions can influence the status of protease sulfur, e.g. GSSG/GSH ratio or oxygenations (Lockwood 2002). A dedicated lysosomal reductase maintains reduction of disulfide bonds and activates CysHis/CysHis(X) cathepsins (see Rybicka et al. 2010; Balce et al. 2014; Allan and Yates 2015; Ewanchuk and Yates 2018). In addition to metal and redox regulation, the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase) is a major influence on the reaction rates of lysosomal CysCts, and the activation of pro-protease zymogens. Hypoxic acidified tissue promotes increased CysCt reaction rates. The relationship between V-ATPase action and lysosomal degradation is well known and omitted here (Xu and Ren 2015). Zn2+ can preemptively decrease the CysHis/CysHis(X) peptidolytic mechanism under otherwise optimal reaction conditions.",

The concentration of free or aquo Zn2+, (i.e. with six hydrogen-bonded water molecules), has been suggested to be in the range of 1\u2013100 picomolar. However, 1-3 micromolar cytoplasmic Zn2+ is neither free nor completely sequestered. Investigators have used various terms to refer to this intermediate form of Zn2+, e.g. \u201cmobile\u201d, \u201cactive\u201d, \u201cloosely buffered\u201d, \u201cexchangeable\u201d, \u201cchelatable\u201d etc. These many forms of Zn2+ can be collectively referred to as \u201cinteractive\u201d Zn2+. This Zn2+ exists in a dynamic exchange among myriad biomolecules with diverse Zn2+ affinities, e.g. citrate, phosphate, certain amino acids, peptides, and many more. Since Zn2+ has six ligand-binding sites (Cau\u00ebt et al. 2010), occupancy of two or four sites, does not eliminate binding to a second ligand. Zn2+ interactions with various molecular structures and reactions need not be mediated exclusively by aquo Zn2+.

Histidine can oxidize to 2-oxohistidine; however, the significance is uncertain. Many of the variables that interact with CysHis catalytic partners also interact with each other, independent of the protease. For example, glutathione interacts with CysHis proteolysis in several ways. The reducing action of GSH maintains reductive activation of protease sulfur. Oxidized GSSG inhibits cysteinyl proteases, thereby imparting sulfhydryl/disulfide redox buffering of the reaction (Lockwood 2002, Gong et al. 2018). In addition, the Zn2+-binding property of GSH also influences the \u201cfree\u201d Zn2+ intensity (Helbig et al. 2008; Steiger et al. 2017).",

Functional classes of cysteinyl proteases include lysosomal proteases, calpains, caspases, and de-ubiquitinases. Interestingly, a ribosomal protein has unexplained cysteinyl protease activity of unknown function(s) (Sudhamalla et al. 2012). Zn2+ was found to be a particularly strong inhibitor of several caspases (e.g. Perry et al. 1997). Subsequently, it was discovered that Zn2+ inhibition of multiple caspases is mediated by Zn2+-binding allosteric exosites that are remote from their catalytic mechanisms (Eron et al. 2018). Certain viral proteases also have Zn2+ -binding exosites (reviewed in Parvez and Khan 2014). Calpain is inhibited by Zn2+ and activated by Zn2+ deficiency (Nakajima et al. 2014; Miyoshi et al. 2016). Zn2+ is known to interact with the E\u2013F hand structure that is found on calpains and certain papain-like viral proteases. Although the 20S proteasome is a serine protease, it has been reported to have a Zn2+-binding site of high affinity; this binding site is presumably separate from the catalytic mechanism (Chouduri et al. 2008). Zn2+ reportedly induces inhibitory dissociation of the drosophila proteasome subunits (Kiss et al. 2005). Interestingly, most carboxyl proteases are largely uninhibited by the interactive cell Zn2+ intensity; and metallo-proteases require Zn2+ for activity.",

Lysosomes have opposing Zn2+ import and export systems. Vacuolar Zn2+ transport serves at least three functions. (a) Lysosomes of some species can serve as Zn2+ storage depots for use in times of Zn2+ insufficiency (Roh et al. 2012). (b) Lysosomal Zn2+ regulation can influence lysosomal proteolytic function (Sweeney et al. 2003; Lockwood 2010).

Since 98% of cell Zn2+ is sequestered within proteins, bulk protein degradation provides a large Zn2+ reservoir that can be released by increasing turnover. Zn2+ deficiency induces autophagy and releases sequestered Zn2+ from degraded cell proteins as investigated in yeast and plants. This restores interactive cell Zn2+ levels and promotes survival under Zn2+ deficiency as reported in several recent studies (Eguchi et al. 2017; Ding and Zhong 2017; Horie et al. 2017; Kawamata et al. 2017; Nakatogawa 2018). In theory, release of Zn2+ from degraded proteins can provide a self-limiting inhibitory effect or \u201cbrake\u201d on the rate of Zn2+-sensitive protein turnover. In the future, Zn2+-interactive inhibitors of the CysHis catalytic mechanism might be combined with agents acting at separate sites on the same protease, or other sites of lysosomal and cellular Zn2+ regulation.",

Figure 4 illustrates the transfer of electron density from the bidentate biguanide ligand to the Zn2+ cation. Experimental evidence is consistent with this structure under pharmacological concentrations and conditions. With some metals, di-biguanide complexes can form with a central metal, i.e. 2 biguanides: 1 central metal.

The anti-parasitic action of proguanil was initially attributed to inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by the metabolite cycloguanil. However, various biguanide derivatives that do not inhibit dihydrofolate reductase do have anti-malarial action. Conversely, much of the anti-malarial action of proguanil is independent of its anti-folate effect (Fidock and Wellems 1997). Thus, proguanil and other biguanides are drugs of multiple anti-malarial mechanisms. Inhibition of parasite CysCts inhibits intra-erythrocytic growth of parasites (reviewed in Sijwali and Rosenthal 2016). Parasite hemoglobinolysis results in a large accumulation of heme-Fe3+ and free Fe3+ within erythrocytes. Biguanide binds metal cations from most of the periodic table, including Fe3+ (Prugnard and Noel 1996). A sufficient concentration of Fe3+ alone can inhibit CysHis/CysHis(X) proteases; although Fe3+ is much less potent than Zn2+ (Lockwood 2006). We suggested that metformin is a metal-interactive anti-proteolytic agent, which might improve anti-malarial drug combinations (Lockwood 2010; Sharma et al. 2016b, c). As predicted, metformin has recently been found to increase the anti-malarial action of other drugs (Oriaifo 2018); multiple mechanisms have been suggested.",

Modeling the interaction of a rigid ligand with a rigid binding site does not account for conformational changes in either.

Moreover, no present approach can account for all inter-molecular forces that determine ligand\u2013protein interactions (discussed in Guedes et al. 2018). Indeed, some of the ligand\u2013protein binding forces are not fully understood, and cannot be modeled, e.g. pi-electron interactions (see below section).",

The S2 subsite position has since been confirmed as a major determinant of substrate preference and reaction kinetics in many proteases (Turk et al. 2012; Corvo et al. 2018). Nearly all proteases of the papain superfamily appear to have an S2 position that accepts bulky hydrophobic amino acids, e.g. the phenyl moiety of BAA.

In the absence of metals the CysHis/CysHis(X) peptidolytic reaction involves formation of thiolate anion and imidazolium cation by transfer of the proton (illustrated in Berg et al. 2002). A lone electron pair of the nearby imidazole ring attracts the proton from the cysteine sulfhydryl. The proton attraction of imidazole lowers the pH at which the sulfhydryl ionizes so as to become a nucleophile. Loss of the proton from the sulfhydryl transforms it into a nucleophile.

With purified cathepsin B the 50% inhibitory concentration of Zn2+ is approximately 1 \u03bcM under 5 mM DTT and pH 5.5. Firstly, the inhibitory action of Zn2+ is opposed by the stimulatory action of reducing factors, including DTT (Balce et al. 2014, 2016). The dithiols of DTT bind and buffer Zn2+. Thus, the actual free Zn2+ intensity in a typical protease assay is less than that added experimentally. Secondly, protons compete with metal cations for binding sites on proteins; therefore metal inhibition of CysCts is also pH dependent. In general, Zn2+ inhibition in cysteinyl protease assays is much greater at higher pH and lesser DTT concentration.",

Exposure to phenformin (0.01 \u00b5M) does not require experimental addition of extracellular Zn2+ for the most rapid time course of its inhibitory action. Due to its great potency, phenformin can acquire sufficient intracellular Zn2+ for maximal anti-proteolytic action at 0.01 \u00b5M drug concentration. In contrast, the anti-proteolytic action of therapeutic metformin concentration (10 \u00b5M) was delayed and submaximal in the absence of extracellular Zn2+ added to the perfusate.

This difference among biguanide derivatives is probably due to lesser binding affinity of the metformin-Zn2+ complex for the protease in conjunction with the competition of DTT for Zn2+ binding.

Accordingly, some biguanide derivatives might coordinately inhibit groups of CysCts, which share common structural features (e.g. Vizovi\u0161ek et al. 2015). Inhibitory potency depends upon the combined affinity of metal and substituents for the active site. A hypothetical biguanide derivative that uniquely complements the binding sites of a particular protease can have a high degree of inhibitory selectivity, but low affinity and potency. A biguanide-metal complex with low affinity can selectively occupy a specific active site 100% of the time if the (non-toxic) drug concentration is adequate.",

This protease is present in the exocytic granules of several differentiated inflammatory cell types (Pham and Ley 1999). Cathepsin C activates pro-inflammatory serine protease zymogens in these exocytic granules; e.g. granzyme A and B, elastase and cathepsin G in neutrophils, or chymase and tryptase in mast cells. These activated serine proteases are released into the extracellular space where they are fundamental to the normal and excessive inflammatory responses.

The structure of the Zn2+ complex of phenformin was computed with the Spartan\u201908 program (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA) using density functional theory at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G* level. The computed structure is consistent with empirical observations under conditions and concentrations that are relevant to medicinal use (see text). Zn2+ forms a 1:1 biguanide complex through imino nitrogens at the 2 and 4 positions as illustrated in Fig. 2. Experimental evidence indicates that these nitrogens remain protonated as shown. In coordination complexes, electron density can be transferred from the ligand to the metal cation. The surface potential gradation from negative to positive is qualitatively indicated by gradation from red to blue in the mesh. Zn2+ is shown in green, carbon: black, nitrogen: blue, hydrogen: white.

Structures were computed as in Fig. 4; but illustrated without the mesh. The structure of the phenformin-Zn2+ complex is identical to Fig. 4, but shown here from a different perspective. BAA is an artificial amide substrate of diverse proteases; the amide bond is scissile. Zn2+ inhibits the first step in the peptidolytic reaction. Papain-like proteases have a well-known substrate-binding site known as the S2 site (see the text). When the phenyl moiety of BAA binds to the S2 site, then the scissile amide bond is aligned with the CysHis catalytic partners and is cleaved. However, when the phenyl moiety of the phenformin-Zn2+ complex binds to the S2 site, then the inhibitory Zn2+ cation is directed to the location of the CysHis catalytic partners; and the protease is inhibited. Slight rotations or flexions of bonds can yield even closer dimensional correspondence. The Zn2+ complex of metformin does not have the phenyl ring; and the dimethyl moieties do not align with the S2 site when the metal aligns with the catalytic pair. Metformin inhibits cell protein degradation with a potency that is far less than metformin, i.e. \u2248 10 \u03bcM vs. \u2248 0.01 \u03bcM (Sweeney et al. 2003; Lockwood 2010, and see text). Thus, interaction of the phenyl ring with the S2 site is an important determinant of inhibitory potency. (Color figure online)",

Left side: Zn2+ has 6 ligand-binding sites. Biguanide forms bidentate Zn2+ complexes through the two imino nitrogens (Figs. 2, 4). Catalytic partners consisting of Cys(thiolate)-His(imidazole) also have bidentate affinity for Zn2+. The thiolate-imidazole catalytic partners, and the imino biguanide nitrogens can reversibly form a mixed complex with a centrally coordinated Zn2+ i.e. a \u201cdrug-Zn2+-protease sandwich\u201d. Access of water to the 2 unoccupied sites of Zn2+ in the recessed active site is uncertain. Right side: Diverse papain-like proteases have various arrays of substrate-binding sites on the protease surface surrounding the catalytic partners (schematized collectively by the bottom square plane; see the text). Appropriate biguanide substituent moieties (top square plane) can register with the array of substrate-binding sub-sites surrounding the metal sandwich. However, drug interactions with the protease surface surrounding the catalytic pair need not involve defined binding pockets. Many different substituents of biguanide at the 1 or 1 and 5 positions are possible (Fig. 1). The selectivity of the inhibitory interaction depends upon the extent of 3D structural and chemical complementarity between substituents and protease surface. The potency of inhibition is a different property, which depends upon attractive vs. repulsive forces stabilizing the metal sandwich. (Color figure online)",

In this cartoon the correspondences between the protease binding sites and the inhibitor structure are hypothetical approximations for the sake of illustration.
