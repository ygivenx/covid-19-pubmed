            "text": "Autophagy, characterized by the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and subsequent lysosome-based degradation of damaged or excess cellular components, plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis7,8. Autophagy is initiated at the isolation membrane, usually from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and autophagosome formation is dependent on the so-called autophagy-related gene (ATG) products9. Till now, 40 ATG proteins have been identified in yeast and many mammalian homologs for these have been found10. However, only half of these are essential for formation of canonical autophagosomes, including ATG1-10, 12\u201314, 16\u201318, 29, and 3111. Central to canonical autophagy are two ubiquitination-like conjugation systems, ATG12 conjugation system and the microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3 (LC3)/ATG8 lipidation system. Both ATG12 and ATG8 are activated by the same E1-like enzymes called ATG712. In the ATG12 conjugation system, ATG7 facilitates the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5, forming the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate13. In the LC3 lipidation system, activated LC3-I is transferred to ATG3 and finally conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)14. This LC3-PE conjugate is known as LC3-II and is one of the most accepted markers of autophagy now15.",

Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy is activated upon viral infection17. Depending on the virus and the host cell, autophagy can have different effects during viral infection, either as an innate host antiviral defense mechanism or as a pro-viral process18. As an integral part of immune system, autophagy has been shown to function in host antiviral defense by limiting viral replication, influencing viral antigens presentation or targeting virions and virus components for autophagic degradation19\u201322. Conversely, certain viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to exploit the autophagy system for their replication23\u201326. For example, autophagy proteins (i.e., Beclin-1, ATG4B, ATG5, and ATG12) are proviral factors required for translation of incoming hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and, therefore, for establishment of productive infection27. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that HTLV-1 infection increases the accumulation of autophagosomes and that this accumulation benefits viral replication28, although detailed mechanisms remain to be clarified.",

Further study indicated that DMB was associated with ATG7, one of the core autophagy proteins essential for canonical autophagy, and increased its acetylation.

We first examined DM\u0392 expression in HTLV-1 infected cells. We compared the expression of DM\u0392 in non-infected Jurkat T-cell line as well as in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines (C8166 and MT2). Immunoblot assays indicated that the HTLV-1-positive MT2 and C8166 cells showed strong expression of endogenous DM\u0392 protein, whereas the HTLV-1-negative Jurkat cells did not (Fig. 1A). We next examined DM\u0392 expression in HTLV-1 infected Hela and PMA-differentiated THP1 (a human macrophage-like cell line, PMA-THP1) cells. Hela and PMA-THP1 cells were co-cultured with MT2 cells and immunoblot assays demonstrated that DM\u0392 expression was induced in MT2-co-cultured cells (Fig. 1B).\n",

            "text": "We tried to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which DMB expression was induced in HTLV-1 infected cells. Because the reverse transcription intermediates (RTIs) of retroviruses could be recognized by DNA sensors, we speculated that DMB might be induced by cytosolic DNA sensor pathways. It has been clarified that HTLV-1 RTIs interact with STING and HTLV-1 infection triggers a robust anti-viral innate immune response in primary monocytes32. Although the exact roles of cGAS and IFI16 in HTLV-1 infection were unclear, it is known that IFI16 and cGAS could interact with RTIs generated by some other retroviruses and recruit STING for downstream signal transduction33,34. So, we first investigated the roles of cGAS, IFI16 and STING in DMB induction during HTLV-1 infection. Interestingly, after cGAS, IFI16 or STING knockdown, the DMB expression was decreased markedly in Hela cells after HTLV-1 co-culture (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the DMB induction by HTLV-1 infection dependent on cytosolic DNA sensors. Then we tried to figure out the downstream signaling pathways involved in this process. We treated Hela cells with Fludarabine (for STAT1 inhibition), Nifuroxazide (for STAT1/3/5 inhibition), BAY11\u20137082 (for NF-\u03baB inhibition), SB203580 (for p38 MAPK inhibition), SP600125 (for JNK1/2/3 inhibition) or U0126 (for MEK1/2 inhibition) and the DMB expression was examined after MT2 infection. The results suggested NF-\u03baB was involved in DMB induction by HTLV-1 infection (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data suggested that the expression of DM\u0392 could be induced by HTLV-1 infection and NF-\u03baB was critical to HTLV-1 triggered DMB production.",

We purchased three siRNA constructs and determined their effects on DMB expression.

Then the H3 was used to silence the DMB expression and the effect of endogenous DMB expression on HTLV-1 protein expression was investigated. As shown in Fig. 3B, immunoblot assays demonstrated that the expressions of Tax and p19 were increased after the knockdown of DMB in MT2 cells. Consistently, after DM\u0392 was silenced in the MT2 cells, proviral transcription was monitored by real-time PCR assays and the results indicated that the expression levels of HTLV-1 proviral transcripts for Tax, p19, Env and px were higher in DMB-silenced MT2 cells (Fig. 3C). Similar results were observed in Jurkat and primary CD4+ T cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Next, we examined the role of DM\u0392 in HTLV-1 infected Hela or PMA-THP1 cells. After the knockdown of DM\u0392, Hela or PMA-THP1 cells were co-cultured with MT2 cells and HTLV-1 protein expression was investigated.

Hela cells were transfected with SC or H3 and then co-cultured with MT2 cells. At 24 h after co-culturation, the expression levels of IFN\u03b2 and IFN-responsive genes were examined by real-time PCR assays. The results suggested that the knockdown of DMB had no significant effects on HTLV-1 infection induced production of IFN\u03b2 and IFN-responsive genes (see Supplementary Fig. S2). It has been reported that HTLV-1 infection increases the accumulation of autophagosomes and that this accumulation increases HTLV-1 production28. Then we examined the effects of DMB on HTLV-1 induced autophagosome accumulation. DMB was silenced in MT2 cells and immunoblot assays were performed. We found that the knockdown of DMB increased the amount of LC3-II protein levels (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed in Jurkat and primary CD4+ T cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Then we repeated the above analysis in MT2-co-cultured Hela and PMA-THP1 cells. After co-culture with MT2 cells, Hela (Fig. 4B) or PMA-THP1 (Fig. 4C) cells transfected with H3 displayed enhanced LC3-II expression and reduced p62 expression compared to the cells transfected with control siRNA. Consistently, the accumulation of LC3-II was increased in DMB-knockdown Hela cells compared to control cells after co-culture with MT2 cells as determined by GFP-LC3 assays (Fig. 4D and E). Finally, we determined the role of DMB in MT2-co-cultured cells in the presence of 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), which is believed to block the early stage of autophagy15. We found that DMB knockdown could not affect 3-MA inhibited LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 4F). Meanwhile, in 3-MA treated Hela cells, DMB knockdown could not increase HTLV-1 protein expression (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the effect of DMB on HTLV-1 protein expression was associated with autophagy. Taken together, these results suggest DMB inhibits HTLV-1 induced autophagosome accumulation and this effect is important to its role in regulating HTLV-1 protein expression.\n",

As shown in Fig. 7B, the DMB truncation mutants D1 (aa1\u2013112), D3 (aa1\u2013247), and D4 (aa1\u2013207) coimmunoprecipitated with ATG7, whereas D2 (aa113\u2013263) did not, suggesting that the 1-112aa of DMB might be essential for its association with ATG7. Interestingly, although the truncation mutants D3 and D4 contained the 1-112aa of DMB, their ability of interacting with ATG7 was decreased compared to the D1 mutant and the full-length DMB. There was a possibility that the 112-207aa of DMB might block the binding site to some extent and the YXXZ motif (mediating the targeting to the lysosomal compartments) might enhance the interaction by affecting the location and 3D structure of DMB. Then, we determined whether the interaction between DMB and ATG7 was important for the regulatory function of DMB during HTLV-1 infection. Hela cells were transfected with full-length (FL) DMB or its D2 mutant and then co-cultured with MT2 cells. Immunoblot assays demonstrated that the D2 mutant had only a slight effect on LC3-II accumulation and HTLV-1 protein expression (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results suggest that the 1-112aa of DMB is important for its interaction with ATG7 and this interaction is required for the regulatory function of DMB during HTLV-1 infection.\n",

As shown in Fig. 8A, the exogenous expression of DM\u0392 promoted the acetylation of ATG7 in both MT2-co-cultured Hela cells and untreated Hela cells. We confirmed this result in endogenous conditions and found the knockdown of DMB decreased the acetylation of ATG7 in MT2 cells (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the D2 mutant of DMB, which was unable to interact with ATG7, had a slight effect on the acetylation of ATG7 in MT2-co-cultured Hela cells (Fig. 8C). Because ATG7 could activate ATG12 and promote the formation of ATG12-ATG5 complex13, we examined whether DMB impaired the ATG12-ATG5 conjugation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the knockdown of DMB enhanced the endogenous ATG12-conjugation no matter in MT2-co-cultured PMA-THP1 cells (Fig. 8D) or MT2 cells (Fig. 8E). Then we tried to explore the mechanism by which DMB enhance the acetylation. It has been reported that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) can interact with ATG7 and directly deacetylate ATG736. So we tried to determine whether DMB modulated the acetylation of ATG7 via Sirt1. We inhibited the Sirt1 activity by EX527 in Hela cells and found that DMB had little effect on the acetylation of ATG7 in the presence of EX527 (see Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting the effect of DMB on the acetylation of ATG7 may be dependent on Sirt1 activity. We assumed that DMB might have the potential to regulate the acetylation of ATG7 by disrupting its interaction with Sirt1. To address this issue, we examined the effect of exogenous expressed DMB on the association between ATG7 and Sirt1 by competitive coimmunoprecipitation. The results suggested that DMB was able to decrease the association of Sirt1 with ATG7 (see Supplementary Fig. S4B). Then we explored the effect of endogenous DMB on the interaction between Sirt1 and ATG7. The knockdown of DMB in MT2 or MT2-co-cultuled PMA-THP1 cells increased the amount of Sirt1 that coimmunoprecipitated with ATG7 (see Supplementary Fig. S4C and D), suggesting DMB might regulate the acetylation of ATG7 by inhibiting the interaction between Sirt1 and ATG7. Taken together, these results suggest DMB inhibits autophagosome accumulation by increasing the acetylation of ATG7.\n",

We used LC3-II as the marker of autophagy and examined the effect of DMB on HTLV-1 induced autophagy. Our findings confirmed the hypothesis by three steps. Firstly, DMB inhibited the autophagosome accumulation in MT2 cells. Secondly, DMB inhibited the autophagosome accumulation induced by HTLV-1 infection in Hela, PMA-THP1 or primary human monocytes. Thirdly, when we used 3-MA to block the early stage of autophagy, we found that DMB knockdown lost the abilities to promote autophagosome accumulation and to increase HTLV-1 viral protein expression, suggesting that the regulatory role of DMB in autophagosome accumulation was important to its effect on HTLV-1 protein expression.",

One may think that the inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion by Tax results in increased autophagosome accumulation and decreased degradation of HTLV-1 protein, leading to increased HTLV-1 proteins abundance. Interestingly, our data showed that the DMB expression inhibited autophagosome accumulation at the early phase of the autophagy pathway and resulted in impaired HTLV-1 protein expression. These results indicated that the autophagosome formation might provide convenience for HTLV-1 protein expression. It is possible that HTLV-1 infection promotes the autophagosome formation to benefit its replication.
