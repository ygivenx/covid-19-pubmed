Four samples (NAB033, NAB059, NAB063 and NAB069) had varying amounts of RSC3 directed CD4BS antibodies (55, 40.2, 32.3 and 91% respectively), as indicated by their ability to bind selectively to the wild type protein but not to the mutant form (i.e., difference in binding activity between RSC3 and RSC3\u2206371I/P363N was significant, p < 0.05). RSC3 specific IgG was eluted from these four samples and binding activity was compared with that of well characterized MAbs such as VRC01, VRC03, b12 and 3BNC117 (Fig. 3A,B and Table 3). Further, neutralization titer assay was performed for RSC3-specific IgG eluted from the four BCN plasma samples with a VRC01- resistant and sensitive pseudovirus (DU422 and CAP45.2.00), a sensitive and resistant tier-2 pseudovirus (JR-FL wild type and JR-FL mutant D279A), as well as a tier-3 pseudovirus (PVO-4). Known CD4BS monoclonal antibodies VRC01 and b12, were used as positive controls. The known CD4BS antibodies showed stronger neutralization of the wild type (sensitive) viruses than IgG eluted from BCN samples as the former were monoclonal and the latter were polyclonal in nature. Two BCN plasma samples (NAB069 and NAB063) strongly neutralized JR-FL WT (IC50 at 1.18 and 1.28 \u03bcg/ml respectively) but not the mutant JR-FL D279A, while NAB059 weakly neutralized JR-FL WT (IC50 at 9.1 \u03bcg/ml). NAB069, NAB063 and NAB033 neutralized tier-3 HIV-1 subtype B pseudovirus PVO-4 at >5 \u03bcg/ml. NAB069 alone neutralized CAP45.2.00 virus at 9 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 3C and Table 4).",

It is known from literature that PG9/PG16 bNAbs do not neutralize the HIV-1 subtype B JR-FL WT strain due to presence of glutamic acid (E) at 168 position. However, when E is replaced with lysine (K) in the WT JR-FL strain by single mutation, it turned sensitive to neutralization by PG9/PG16 antibodies13. We therefore used these two pseudoviruses (JR-FL WT and JR-FL E168K) for further analysis of PG9/PG16 like bNAbs. Four samples strongly neutralized (>3 fold) the mutant pseudovirus than the JR-FL WT (Fig. 4B and Table 6). Neutralization was also performed for the identification of positional dependence using two double mutants JR-FL E168K N156K and JR-FL E168K N160K (Fig. 4C). Three of the four samples (NAB016, NAB062 and NAB069) showed reduced neutralization of both double mutants (3\u20135 fold reduction) as compared to the single mutant (Table 7). One sample (NAB033) showed <3 fold reduction in neutralization of both the double mutants.",

NAB069 showed a 1.5 fold higher titer for neutralization of chimeric virus containing the subtype B MPER (C1) as compared to the one containing the subtype C MPER (C1C), suggesting the presence of 2F5, 4E10 or Z13e1-like neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, for NAB122, there was a significant drop in ID50 value with virus containing the subtype C MPER as compared to the one containing the subtype B MPER. However, the two plasma samples (NAB069 and NAB122) neutralized C6 strain which recognizes the 4E10 epitope, WFDIT, which is present in both subtypes B and C. NAB120 did not neutralize any of the chimera viruses.",

Two samples (NAB016 and NAB059) showed reactivity with the Kennedy epitope (KE; PRGPDRPEGIEEEGGERDRDRS)33 present in the transmembrane (TM) region of gp41 (amino acids 731 to 752 as on HXB2)34. This region is known to contain three epitopes PDRPEG (KE1), IEEE (KE2) and ERDRD (KE3), and antibodies to these epitopes are thought to bind to HIV-1 particles after they attach themselves to the cell receptors35. In general, the antibody response to the Kennedy epitopes in HIV-1 infected individuals is thought to be very weak36. Interestingly, the Indian reference strain, 93IN101 (pIndie), has amino acid substitutions in KE1 and KE3, resulting in an altered amino acid composition of the epitopes (PDRLGR and EQDKDR respectively). NAB016 and NAB059 exhibited a high binding affinity to PDRLGR, suggesting that changes in KE1 of subtype C has relevance to improved binding antibody response, which might or might not translate to inactivation of HIV-1 by neutralization. MPER comprises the last 23 residues of the gp41 ectodomain. Several well characterized NAbs like 2F5, Z13e1, 4E10 and 10E8 bind to linear epitopes in MPER1737.

Before 2009, b12 was the only CD4BS bNAb that was identified. However, since 2009, several CD4BS bNAbs with greater breadth and potency of neutralization than b12 have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, such as VRC01-03, VRC23, NIH45-46, 3BNC117, etc38, and two of these, VRC01 and 3BNC117, are currently being tested for use as therapeutic vaccines against HIV-13940. We first tested plasma binding activity to the wild type RSC3 protein which selectively binds to VRC01-like CD4BS specific bNAbs, and a mutant form of the protein which shows decreased binding to CD4BS bNAbs2541. We identified four samples containing VRC01-like CD4BS antibodies, as demonstrated by their ability to preferentially bind to the RSC3 WT protein but not to the mutant form. In order to determine the neutralizing potential of the CD4BS specific antibodies in these samples, we eluted IgG from the plasma and tested them in a neutralization assay with tier-2 and tier-3 pseudoviruses. Two of the four samples, NAB069 and NAB063, exhibited strong neutralization of the tier-2 virus JR-FL WT and tier-3 HIV-1 subtype B pseudovirus PVO-4 but diminished neutralization of JR-FL D279A, just like VRC01. These observations provide clear evidence to show that these samples contain CD4BS specific antibodies with neutralization ability. Our findings mirror those of Landais et al.42 and others that although RSC3 binding activity may be found in some HIV-1 infected individuals42, RSC3 reactive antibodies mediating broad neutralization were only detected in very few individuals. A major limitation of the RSC3 binding approach as observed by previous investigators (Walker et al.14) is that some CD4BS bNAbs may not bind to the RSC3 protein, necessitating the use of additional recombinant gp120 (rgp120) core molecules1443. However, we could not perform further experiments with rgp120 adsorbed antibodies due to insufficient sample volume.",

            "text": "It is well known that HIV uses glycan shields to escape attack by the host immune system. The glycan shields hinder accessibility to the neutralizing antibody binding sites. Thus, identification of bNAbs that target some of the critical glycans on the HIV envelope could pave the way for designing an effective vaccine against HIV44. Potential N-linked glycans at positions 160 and 332 on the HIV envelope are known to be very crucial for the binding of glycan dependent antibodies belonging to the PG9/PG16 and PGT series, respectively1345. We evaluated the BCN samples identified in our study for the presence of potential N-linked glycan dependent antibodies. For this purpose, we performed neutralization assay with a subtype C pseudovirus, DU156WT, and its mutant forms DU156N160K and DU156N332A. Studies have shown that viruses, mutated at position 160 (V2 loop) escape neutralization by PG9/PG16 antibodies2646. We identified four samples (NAB016, NAB033, NAB062 and NAB069) that strongly neutralized DU156WT but showed reduced levels of neutralization of the mutant virus DU156N160K, suggesting that these samples are likely to contain PG9/PG16 like antibodies. One of the four samples, NAB062, showed a 25-fold reduction in neutralization of DU156N160K as compared to DU156WT, indicating the strong specificity of the antibodies present in this sample to this epitope. In addition, these four samples also demonstrated strong neutralization of the JR-FL E168K mutant pseudovirus as compared to WT JR-FL pseudovirus, providing further support for the PG9/PG16-like specificity of the antibodies in these samples. This is due to the presence of glutamic acid (E) at 168 position in JR-FL that masks the exposure of asparagine (N) glycans at positions 156 and 160 thereby abrogating the binding of PG9/PG16 like antibodies to this epitope13. We found a further reduction in the neutralization activity of the plasma on the double mutants (JR-FL E168K N156K and JR-FL E168K N160K) as compared to the single mutant, providing further proof to document the presence of PG9/PG16 like bNAbs in these samples.",

To identify if antibodies with similar specificities were present in any of our BCN samples, we analyzed the plasma for neutralization activity against the subtype C virus, DU156WT and mutant DU156 N332A pseudovirus. Seven BCN samples neutralized DU156WT indicating the presence of antibodies belonging to the PGT series. Similar observations of a high frequency of N332 glycan-dependant antibodies among HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals from sub-Saharan Africa was recently reported by Landais et al.42. Of the seven samples, one sample NAB062, showed 24.3 folds reduction in neutralization of the mutant as compared to the WT. Two other samples, NAB046 and NAB069, also showed a reduction of 3.3 and 3.5 fold in neutralization of the mutant as compared to WT virus. This suggests the possibility that the above three samples could contain antibodies similar to the PGT series of antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first study from India to demonstrate the presence of PGT series of bNAbs among HIV-1C infected individuals from the country. Of special interest, we noticed that sample NAB069 had antibodies with multiple specificities, such as CD4BS, V2 glycans and V3 glycan.",

The Dynabeads and bound protein were separated from the coupling buffer with a magnet and resuspended in 5 ml of blocking buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.5% [wt/vol] bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 0.05% Tween 20) for an additional 48 hours. The blocking buffer was removed by aspiration, and the protein-coupled Dynabeads were washed two times with 5 ml of wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). The beads were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of storage buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.02% sodium azide + protease inhibitors) and stored at 4 \u00b0C. On the following day, the protein-coupled beads were washed three times with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS at room temperature for 30 minutes to block nonspecific binding to the beads. Samples exhibiting strong neutralization activity were diluted 1:50 in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and 1 ml of the diluted plasma was incubated with 0.5 ml of beads at room temperature for 30 minutes. This step was repeated three times for the better removal of antibodies. Beads coupled with RSC3 or MPER-specific antibodies were stored in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide at 4 \u00b0C. The remaining plasma was centrifuged three times at 16,100 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes each time to remove any residual Dynabeads and used subsequently for ELISA and neutralization assays. BSA-coated beads or blank beads were used as negative controls. The protein-coupled beads were washed three times with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and once with PBS, and the antibodies were eluted by stepwise decrease in pH. First, the beads were mixed with 100 mM glycine-HCl elution buffer (pH 2.7) for 30 seconds. The beads were then centrifuged for 30 seconds and held in place at the bottom of the tube with a magnet. The acid-eluted solution containing IgG was quickly removed and placed in a separate tube containing 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris (pH 9.0) buffer to reach pH 7.0 to 7.4. This process was repeated three times. The eluted IgG was diluted in DMEM and concentrated over a 30-kDa Centricon plus filter (Millipore Corp.). Subsequently, the same procedure was performed on the beads at an elution pH of 2.2 to recover any IgG resistant to elution at pH 2.7. The IgG fractions recovered by both acid elution steps were combined and the concentration of the combined IgG fractions was measured using nanodrop technology (Thermofisher). The IgG was further characterized by ELISA using RSC3 protein and its double mutant RSC3\u0394371I/P363N. Known monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (MAbs) VRC01, VRCO3, b12 and 3BNC117 that bind specifically to the CD4BS were used as positive controls.",

Briefly, TZM-bl cells were infected with the pesudoviruses in the presence or absence of plasma. After 48 hours, 100 \u03bcl of BriteLite (PerkinElmer) substrate was added to the wells. 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was transferred to a solid opaque plate and luminescence was measured as relative luciferase units (RLU) using the Vector 3 luminometer (Perkin Elmer). Initial neutralization screening assays were performed at a plasma dilution of 1:10 dilution. Subsequently, for the determination of IC50/ID50 values, serial dilutions of the plasma samples ranging from 1:20 to 1:43,740 or 1:10 to 1:100,000 were used. Anti-glycan and anti-MPER specific neutralization activity was evaluated using Du156WT, Du156N160K, Du156N332A, JR-FLWT, JR-FL E168K, JR-FL E168K N156K, JR-FL E168K N160K and HIV-2 7312A, HIV-2/HIV-1 MPER chimeric constructs.
