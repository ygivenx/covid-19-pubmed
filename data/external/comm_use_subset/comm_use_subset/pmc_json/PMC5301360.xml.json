RSV accounts for more than 60% of acute respiratory tract infection cases among young children. For children younger than 1 year, RSV can account for approximately 80% of lower respiratory infections, and almost all children are infected by RSV before the age of 3 years [3, 4]. RSV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and harbors non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA as its genetic material. There are two major RSV subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B, which are distinguished by their surface glycoproteins and genetic variation [5]. The two RSV subtypes often co-circulate during epidemic seasons [6, 7].",

            "text": "Timely and accurate diagnosis of RSV infections plays an important role in their management and treatment because it is often challenging to distinguish RSV infections from other viral or bacterial respiratory tract infections based on the clinical presentation alone [8]. Timely diagnosis also plays a crucial role in avoiding inappropriate use of antibiotics, thereby lowering the risk of antimicrobial resistance [9]. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), especially reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are increasingly used to detect RSV because they are more sensitive than rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) [10]. Despite the superior sensitivity of RT-PCR over RADTs, RADTs remain an important diagnostic tool, especially in point-of-care settings, due to their shorter turnaround time and ease of use [11, 12]. Conversely, specialised training and sophisticated and costly instrumentation are required to perform RT-PCR. Consequently, the method is often confined to specialised and large central laboratories.",

To reduce the diagnostic time, we developed an isothermal reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA) assay for the detection of RSV. In RT-SIBA reactions, RSV RNA is first transcribed to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase and immediately amplified and detected under isothermal reaction conditions [13, 14]. SIBA utilize a recombinase-coated single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) for the separation of a target duplex. This leads to the generation of a single-stranded target template, which subsequently becomes bound and extended by target-specific primers via the action of polymerase. The repeated cycles of recombinase-dependent strand separation and subsequent polymerase-dependent extension of the target leads to an exponential amplification under isothermal conditions.",

RSV sequences were retrieved from the Virus Pathogen Resource [16] as well as the National Center for Biotechnology Information database and aligned. The assay was designed to amplify ~70 nucleotides within the highly conserved region of the RSV N-protein gene. The assay used the same target region within the RSV-A and RSV-B genomes. The RSV-A and RSV-B genomes share about 90% homology within the chosen target region. A set of primers and invasion oligonucleotides (IOs) were designed to amplify this target region. The RSV assay used one forward primer, one reverse primer, two IOs, and one probe. The use of multiple IOs facilitated improved detection of RSV-A and RSV-B in the same reaction tube, but could not differentiate between the two subtypes of RSV. The RT-SIBA assay was also developed to detect the bacteriophage MS2. Target-specific probes for both the RSV and MS2 assays were designed as previously described [17]. This allowed the RSV and MS2 assays to be multiplexed in the same reaction tube. The MS2 assay served as an internal control for monitoring sample-derived inhibition [18].",

Total RNA were extracted from these specimens and subsequently used to further evaluate the performance of the RT-SIBA and RT-PCR RSV assays. The results are shown in Table 3. Both the RT-SIBA and RT-PCR RSV assays detected RSV in all 25 NP specimens that were previously confirmed to be positive for RSV.

RSV was detected in all 25 RSV-positive NP specimens by RT-SIBA using this crude sample lysis method. The detection of RSV by RT-SIBA was faster with clinical specimens extracted using a commercial extraction kit than with clinical specimens subjected to the rapid sample processing method. This could be due to a difference in the final amount of RNA present in the reaction. RSV was not detected in any of the RSV-negative NP specimens by the RT-SIBA RSV assay. It took approximately 5 min per specimen to perform the rapid specimen preparation protocol, whereas purification of RNA from NP specimens took approximately 45 min. The results suggest that a crude sample processing protocol could be used with RT-SIBA to further shorten the total amount of time needed to detect RSV from NP specimens.",

This method is reported to be useful for the detection of pathogens [13, 14, 17, 19]. SIBA is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that relies on a recombinase-dependent oligonucleotide and target-specific primers to rapidly amplify a DNA duplex [14, 17]. The inclusion of a reverse transcription enzyme in SIBA reactions (RT-SIBA) facilitates the rapid detection of RNA from pathogens [13]. SIBA reactions are performed at a low and constant temperature (41 \u00b0C) and therefore do not require complex instrumentation, in contrast with RT-PCR. Consequently, RT-SIBA is compatible with less complex devices, which could be suitable for point-of-care applications. These portable devices do not require highly specialised personnel to run and interpret the results [19, 20]. In this study, RT-SIBA reactions were performed with a qPCR device for the convenience of performing multiple reaction conditions and replicates. The RT-SIBA assay was developed to detect both the RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes, but not to distinguish between them.",

The RT-SIBA assay detected 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B RNA after 14 and 16 min, respectively. The detection time differed between the RSV subtypes because the RSV-B target region has two nucleotides that are not complementary to the assay. SIBA can typically tolerate 1\u20133 nucleotide mutations in the assay target region, but this leads to a slightly slower detection time, as seen with RSV-B RNA [14]. Nonetheless, the detection time reported for RT-SIBA RSV was significantly faster than that of RT-PCR, which took approximately 2 h. RT-SIBA detected RSV in a highly specific manner, without cross-reacting with other common respiratory pathogens.",

The method was compatible with a rapid sample processing method, further shortening the total amount of time needed to detect RSV from clinical specimens. The detection times of RT-SIBA are similar to those of RADTs. RADTs used to detect RSV can take 15\u201330 min [21, 22]. However, RADTs are often less sensitive than RT-PCR [10]. Despite the superior sensitivity of RT-PCR over RADTs, RADTs still play an important role in the diagnosis of RSV, especially within point-of-care settings, due to their rapid detection time and ease of use. RT-SIBA displayed a detection time as rapid as that of RADTs and a high analytical sensitivity similar to that of RT-PCR.",
