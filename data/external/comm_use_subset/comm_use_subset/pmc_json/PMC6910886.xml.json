            "text": "Zoonoses are infections that can be transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa (WHO 2018). Globally, zoonotic infections are responsible for a high disease burden; approximately 60% of all known human diseases and 75% of diseases associated with recent epidemics or pandemics were zoonoses (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Taylor et al. 2009; WHO 2017). Despite the high prevalence of zoonoses, the emergence of zoonotic disease remains difficult to predict and the underlying mechanisms that drive these processes are not well-understood. Studies of zoonotic exposure and hazardous behavior, including the co-sampling of animals, humans, and food products with animal origins, are one approach for better predicting and ultimately intervening in zoonotic disease outbreaks. Contact with infected animals, and/or exposure to contaminated environments, contributes to the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases in human populations. It is additionally known that increased contact between animals and humans provides more opportunity for exposure to zoonotic pathogens (WHO 2017). Accordingly, the human populations at the highest risk of zoonotic infections are those that have the most frequent interactions with animals. For this reason, slaughterers, animal health workers, animal-raising farmers, and those that trade in wildlife are likely at greater risk of zoonotic infection than those outside of the agricultural industry.\n",

Demography, behavior, attitudes, culture, large animal populations, a high diversity of wild mammalian species, and the coexistence of a broad spectrum of diseases in human and animals are distinctive features of this region, which may lead to the more frequent emergence of zoonotic disease (Morse et al. 2012; Horby et al. 2013; Morand et al. 2014). However, we have a poor understanding of the specific features that lead to zoonotic disease transmission, such as the behavior of those that have sustained contact with animals. Here, we aimed to assess human exposure to animal sources which may be potential reservoirs of zoonotic disease. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the demographics, attitudes, and behavior of assumed high-risk individuals (those with a sustained occupational exposure to animals) living in Vietnam, a country located within the Southeast Asian epicenter of zoonotic diseases. Therefore, we accessed data from a high-risk sentinel cohort (HRSC) study, which was a component of the VIZIONS (Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS) program (Carrique-Mas et al. 2015; Rabaa et al. 2015) to assess how cohort members interacted with animals and identify potential disease exposure risks.",

These individuals were broadly representative of people working with animals in rural Vietnamese provinces and were considered to have common occupations associated with continued exposure to animals. Small-scale animal farming is a substantial form of livelihood in these rural provinces and farmers comprise more than two-thirds of the population in the selected areas (GSO\u2014General Statistics Office of Vietnam 2013). Therefore, it was determined that animal-raising farmers should account for approximately two-thirds of the cohort members.",

The HRSC study followed the cohort members for three years, starting in June 2013 in Dong Thap province and February 2014 in Dak Lak province. In total, the HRSC was comprised of 581 individuals, including 131 animal-raising farmers, 284 family members of animal-raising farmers, 100 slaughterers, 61 animal health workers, and 5 rat traders. Only adult cohort members working with animals were interviewed (n = 297).

Moreover, the animal species that the cohort members were most exposed to (wild pigs, porcupines, rice field rats, deer, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats, ducks, and cattle) are known to be potential reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens (Hart and Trees 1997; Acha and Szyfres 2003; Meng et al. 2009; Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015). These interactions with a range of animals are related to the fact that more than two-thirds of those in the cohort practiced backyard farming. This proportion was higher than the average within the Vietnamese population; approximately 50% of all households in Vietnam are estimated to farm animals (GSO\u2014General Statistics Office of Vietnam 2013), and small-scale animal production is particularly common in rural Vietnam. This industry is maintained by the higher prices (often more than double) demanded for \u201chome reared\u201d animal meat in comparison to animals raised in industrial facilities. Additionally, rural Vietnamese people like to support their community and purchase local produce. A large range of activates in this industry is highlighted by the fact that the majority of farming families reported raising several animal species in small numbers in or around their households (Phuong et al. 2015). These data suggest a low level of biosecurity with the potential for the mixing of multiple animal species; we speculate that this increases the risk of pathogen transfer between animals and may lead to a greater likelihood for exposure to zoonotic diseases in those farming animals. The presence of a large variety of animal types in small areas, particularly in single households farming a mixture of animal species, may increase opportunity for species-crossing pathogen transmission events, as illustrated by the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 virus in Vietnam in 2003, with the first reported case coming from Dong Thap.",

Notably, a low proportion of cohort members reported not using any PPE when handling animals. These data indicate a pervasive poor understanding of occupational exposure that may result in increased potential for zoonotic disease transmission if animals are infected with zoonotic pathogens. This lack of PPE usage was specifically common among the animal slaughterers, where contact with fresh blood is a sustained occupational hazard. The risk of such activities is highlighted by recent reports of the transmission of Trypanosoma evansi and rabies in central and northern Vietnam, which likely occurred during the butchering of raw meat, and processing of the animal brain or via contact with animal saliva, respectively (Wertheim et al. 2009b; Chau et al. 2016). A lack of PPE was also significantly associated with being bitten by animals; while this is not surprising, the proportion of other animal-induced injuries also corresponded with low PPE usage. A study conducted by Rui Carlos and co-workers (Schneider et al. 2013) found that a lack of PPE usage in Brazil was associated with the transmission of Brucella abortus from animals to slaughterers at slaughterhouses. Therefore, this lack of PPE usage may indicate a higher exposure risk for zoonotic infections among cohort subjects. This observation is particularly concerning, and we advocate better education for PPE use in animal worker and slaughters. We suggest that these workers are a key population for exposure to common zoonotic pathogens, such as Brucella, which has been recently found endemic in Vietnam and poses a major risk to human health (Campbell et al. 2017). Additional follow-up studies encompassing serological testing are required to test this hypothesis.",

Almost all of the interviewed cohort members had consumed at least one of thirteen different types of exotic animal over the three-year study period. The thought is that the consumption of exotic animals has preventative health benefits and/or a positive medical treatment effect. For example, the consumption of porcupine stomach is believed to cure stomach pain, and porcupine bile is used as an analgesic. Furthermore, grated deer horn is thought to treat a multitude of chronic diseases and prolong life. A general increase in income across the population and permission from the Vietnamese government for wildlife farming in recent years (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\u2014Vietnam) have played a major role in the rise of exotic animal consumption. The overlap between the types of animals raised, slaughtered, cooked, and consumed by the cohort subjects indicates that increasing consumption requires more intensive farming, slaughtering, cooking, and the hunting exotic animals to supply this increasing demand. As the current economic trajectory is predicted to continue to improve across Vietnam (The World Bank in Vietnam 2017), it is probable that the consumption of exotic animals will increase. This increase in the rearing intensity of exotic animals may have a possible knock-on effect for disease exposures within the general population.",

            "text": "An additional specific practice in Vietnam that may increase the risk of zoonotic exposures is consumption of raw animal blood or meat. More than a half of the cohort members reported the consumption of raw animal blood or meat over the study period. This proportion was high, especially considering that sale of raw blood dishes was banned by the Vietnamese government in 2009 (The Agriculture Ministry of Vietnam). The consumption of raw animal blood is found to have a higher possibility of infections from blood-borne zoonotic pathogens such as Streptococcus suis (Wertheim et al. 2009a; Navacharoen et al. 2009; Trung et al. 2011), Trichinella spiralis (Taylor et al. 2009; De et al. 2015), and Brucella spp. (Njeru et al. 2016). Counter-intuitively, we also found that the majority of the raw-blood consumers considered that eating raw blood was not good for their health. Raw-blood consumption in Vietnam is largely cultural and is a common dish at special gatherings or celebrations in several geographic areas. Raw animal blood is also thought to have potential health benefits, such as boosting the immune system, reducing body temperature, preventing anemia, and as treating headaches, coughs, and dysentery (Thi et al. 2014). These social factors show that culture strongly drives consumer tastes, and restricting the population eating raw animal blood is more of a social issue than a scientific one.",

Approximately a quarter of the subjects had a low education level, which has been previously associated with a higher incidence of numerous communicable diseases (Zimmerman and Woolf 2014; Bruce et al. 2019). These data, together with a high exposure to potential sources of zoonotic disease, indicate a possible elevated risk of zoonotic infections in the cohort subjects. We also identified significant differences between exposures to potential zoonotic sources by location, sex, age group, education level, and profession; high frequency of contact with animals is associated with a likelihood of increased zoonotic transmission (Howard and Fletcher 2012; WHO 2017). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the demographic/social factors that drive zoonotic infections to induce feasible interventions and to determine whether consistency or variation in exposure over time results elevated or reduced risk. To achieve this, it will be essential to further gather information on the incidence of zoonotic disease in those that work with animals and also measure the exposure to given pathogens.\n",

Additionally, we did not distinguish between those farming or hunting exotic animals, as raising many types of exotic animals is common and permitted in Vietnam. Furthermore, we did not evaluate disease episodes with a suitable control group (those not working with animals) or measure serological exposure; therefore, we cannot estimate whether those working with animals do have an increased incidence of infectious disease from an animal origin.",

Sustained animal exposure and a large variety of animal species demonstrate that slaughterers, animal health workers, animal-raising farmers, and rat traders are sentinel professions for performing zoonotic disease surveillance. Additionally, the attitudes and behavior of the cohort members show that they have limited knowledge of potentially zoonotic disease exposures. The data presented here, in combination with further sero-epidemiological and molecular studies, will aid in elucidating the potential factors associated with a comparatively high incidence of emerging zoonotic disease in Southeast Asia. Ultimately, our findings will be useful for better preparedness, intervention plans, disease prediction models, and the development of future research into zoonotic infections in Southeast Asia.",
