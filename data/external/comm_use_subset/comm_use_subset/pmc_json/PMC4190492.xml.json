Pigs affected by SIV usually show an abrupt outbreak of respiratory symptoms characterized by abdominal breathing and coughing, fever, depression, and increased mortality due to secondary bacterial infections [1]. Morbidity may be exhibited at 100% in SIV-infected swine herd, although mortality in the pigs is low [2]. In histopathological terms, the influenza virus infection in pigs is characterized by necrosis of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells during the initial phases of infection. This is accompanied by the accumulation of necrotic debris and neutrophils in the bronchial and bronchiolar lumina [3].",

Since the first SIV was recognized in 1930, the classical swine lineage H1N1 has been relatively stable at the genetic and antigenic levels in the U.S. swine population [5]. In 1998, the swine influenza viruses in U.S. pigs underwent considerable genetic changes that led to the emergence of the so-called triple-reassortant H3N2 [4, 5]. The triple-reassortant H3N2 consists of gene segments from the classical swine virus (M, NP and NS), H3N2 human seasonal virus (HA, NA and PB1), and avian influenza virus (PA and PB2) [5]. Subsequently, in 1999, a second-generation reassortant H1N2 containing genes derived from the triple-reassortant H3N2 and classical swine influenza H1N1 was isolated in U.S. pigs [2].",

According to both serologic and genetic analysis, the three SIV subtypes from Korea are very similar to the classical swine lineage or the triple-reassortant viruses from the U.S. [8, 10]. Although the pathological characteristics of each individual SIV subtype have been investigated, no studies have been conducted to demonstrate the pathogenesis of all three subtypes together.

To provide the virus replication in pig lungs, viral RNA was extracted from lung sample of all pigs, and RT-PCR was conducted as previously described protocol [8]. To determine macroscopic examination, lung lesions were scored using Madec\u2019s grid according to the method described by Madec and Kobisch [12, 13].Lesions were scored on the area in all six lobes that were occupied by virus-induced lesions as follows (expressed as a percentage of the total area): 0 = no lesions (0%), 1 = mild pneumonia (ranging from 1 to 25%), 2 = moderate pneumonia (ranging from 26 to 50%), 3 = severe pneumonia (ranging from 51 to 75%), and 4 = very severe pneumonia (ranging from 76% to 100%). The sum of the overall score for the each lobe was averaged to reflect the gross lesion of an individual pig. For histopathological examination, tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were blindly evaluated by a pathologist. The lung tissues were scored as previously described with slight modifications [3], as follows: (1) severity of pulmonary epithelial cell necrosis (ranging from 0 to 6); (2) infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes (ranging from 0 to 3); (3) thickening of alveolar septa due to infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes (ranging from 0 to 3); (4) pulmonary haemorrhage and edema (ranging from 0 to 3); and (5) atelectasis due to airway plugging or perivascular inflammation (ranging from 0 to 3).

These results are linked to the mean antigen-positive scores from infected pigs, which demonstrated that the viral antigens were not as widely distributed in the lungs of pigs infected with H1N1 or H1N2 at PID 2 when compared to H3N2 infected pigs. Although the H1N1detection in a pig\u2019s lung of three pigs at PID 14 might be caused by second infection between pigs within the same group, no virus was observed by IHC and RT-PCR in other pigs infected with H1N2 or H3N2.",
