The return journey could follow the same path or an alternative path, as depicted in Fig. 2(a,b). The ITN aims to incorporate the key features of how human travel, namely round-trip journeys of shortest time through multiple means of transportation. Here, we invoke the travel time, which depends on the distance and the means of transportation, as the key factor, instead of the effective distance43. Instead of emphasizing the multi-layered network structure as in previous works, ITN takes a traveller\u2019s viewpoint that journeys take place in a single-layered undetachable network with a diversity of links connecting cities representing an inhomogeneous transportation network, see Methods for details. It aims to provide a step closer to a realistic description of human journeys and an alternative platform for studying epidemics on which finer and further details on local area transportation could be added.",

The time that travellers meet becomes a crucial factor. It is related to the length of a link and how fast agents travel on it. As a minimum model, we consider two speeds vs and vf with vs < vf (see solid and dashed lines in Fig. 1) representing slower and faster transportation.

Generally, people travelling are in closer contact and have a higher infectious rate \u03b22 than the non-travelling agents with \u03b2147. An infected agent recovers and becomes susceptible with a recovery rate \u03bc. For travelling agents, we assume that infections take place only among agents in the same segment kr (1 \u2264 kr \u2264 \u03c4ij) of a link. For non-travelling agents, the SIS process is confined to non-travelling agents at the same node. Explicitly, a non-travelling susceptible agent at node i has a probability 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b21)ni,I to be infected at a time step, when there are ni,I infected non-travelling agents at the node.

We illustrated the key ideas by presenting an integrated travel network constructed by considering geographic data, population data and transportation infrastructures in China. An example using only the high-speed trains and highways among the 116 cities of over a million population suffices for stressing the points. An ITN should include: (i) diversity among the links due to different distances and different speeds of transportation; (ii) diversity among the cities due to different population sizes, and transportation services often reflecting their economic growth; (iii) round-trip journeys to targeted destination via paths of shortest time; and (iv) different infection rates for travellers and non-travellers. The ITN can readily be extended to include details on local area transportation, multiple means of transportation, and journeys among different countries. For example, Fig. 1(b) shows schematically a local transportation network with stations (nodes) served by a subway network (dashed lines) and a bus network (solid lines). A journey includes generally travelling in both Fig. 1(a,b). Effects such as traffic congestion naturally emerge. As far as epidemics are concerned, faster and more convenient inter-city journeys would reduce the travel time during which passengers are crowded and thus suppress the chance of being infected, but they would also induce people to make more journeys and to farther places and thus spread a diseases more readily. Our ITN would serve as a good starting point for exploring the interplay of travelling and infection dynamics for many further work.",
