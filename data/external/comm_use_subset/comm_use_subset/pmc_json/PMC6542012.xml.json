Invading pathogen can be bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, fungi or parasites. Early clinical manifestations begin with inflammation and progress to circulatory organ dysfunction associated with significant hematopathologic changes. Well-defined clinical phenotypic features include consumptive thrombocytopenia [1, 2], hemolytic anemia [1], vascular microthrombosis [1\u20134], multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [3], coagulopathy [5] and septic shock. While natural defensive mechanisms of innate and adaptive immune systems of the host (Fig. 1) and effective antimicrobial therapy can favorably influence the course of sepsis, it is still accountable for roughly 15% of in-hospital deaths and 6.2% of discharges to hospice [6].",

Although the role of the endothelium in the pathogenesis of sepsis is not clearly established yet, coagulopathy has been proposed to play a key role through crosstalk mechanism between inflammation and coagulation as a result of systemic endothelial injury [11\u201313]. This theory has been particularly attractive because disseminated intravascular coagulation (\u201cDIC\u201d) commonly occurs in sepsis [14\u201316]. However, a quotation mark has been placed on \u201cDIC\u201d to note that it has been founded on the basis of poorly established concept of hemostasis [1\u20134]. Until recent controversy, \u201cDIC\u201d had been claimed to occur due to uncontrolled systemic activation of coagulation through tissue factor (TF)/FVIIa-initiated hemostasis, manifesting with thrombocytopenia, consumption coagulopathy, microvascular thrombosis and MODS [17, 18].",

This author has made a reinterpretation of \u201cDIC\u201d utilizing clinical, pathological, pathophysiological characteristics and molecular pathogenesis, and has determined it to be identical to disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT) seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome in recent publications [1\u20134, 19].

Indeed, through the better understanding of sepsis-associated coagulopathy, this has become possible to construct \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis derived from the insights of endothelial pathogenesis that leads to microthrombogenesis and TTP-like syndrome. This novel theory, which is simple and easily understandable, was proposed and published [20] and updated in Fig. 2. This effort has allowed us to use the term disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT) instead of \u201cDIC\u201d and endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD/DIT) as a distinct disease entity that is associated with TTP-like syndrome [1\u20134, 19, 20]. This new identity of \u201cDIC\u201d could provide a paradigm shift in the management of sepsis by utilizing targeted therapies to improve the outcome. In addition, this thesis along with \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d (Fig. 3) identifies the true character of \u201cDIC\u201d [1\u20134, 20] as well as the mechanisms of thrombogenesis [4] and different phenotypes of the thrombotic disorder [3, 4, 20].",

The frequently noticed early hematologic manifestation is occurrence of unexplained \u201cthrombocytopenia in critically ill patients\u201d (TCIP), which until recently has been a clinical mystery [1, 2]. Now, it has become evident that thrombocytopenia develops due to contribution of platelets in microthrombogenesis and their consumption. Microthrombogenesis is the process of forming microthrombi composed of platelet-unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) complexes following platelet activation and endothelial exocytosis of ULVWF as a result of endotheliopathy [1\u20133].",

            "text": "Hemostasis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Sepsis occurring due to a variety of pathogen causes generalized endothelial injury as a result of disseminated nature of the circulatory system, and leads to systemic endotheliopathy. However, sepsis-induced endotheliopathy triggers functional changes contributing to molecular dysfunction and subsequent partial hemostasis, mediating microthrombogenesis. Unlike localized traumatic intravascular injury, which initiates bleeding and hemostasis due to combined endothelial and SET/EVT damage [4, 20], anatomic disruption to the vascular endothelium is minimal in sepsis and bleeding is not consequential because endotheliopathy is confined to the endothelium and TF is not exposed [32]. Thus, complement activation due to pathogen or endotoxin provokes endothelial dysfunction promoting exocytosis of ULVWF and platelet activation, which initiates ULVWF path of hemostasis and leads to microthrombogenesis [2, 3] as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This is a very important conception to understand sepsis-associated coagulopathy because sepsis promotes lone activation of ULVWF path without activation of TF path since SET/EVT damage does not occur. This thesis based on microthrombogenesis refutes the current theory that sepsis-associated \u201cDIC\u201d occurs via activation of TF path that leads to fibrinogenesis. Now, \u201cDIC\u201d is reinterpreted to be DIT that occurs via activated ULVWF-initiated thrombogenesis associated with endotheliopathy as illustrated in Fig. 2 [2\u20134, 20].",

This lone activation of ULVWF path in endotheliopathy promotes the formation of microthrombi and lead to EA-VMTD/DIT [2, 3, 20]. Thus, microthombi of \u201cDIC\u201d are the same as those of TTP and TTP-like syndrome. \u201cDIC\u201d has been inappropriately conceptualized as a fibrin clot disease produced via activated TF/FVIIa-initiated cascade/cell-based coagulation. This ill-founded DIC must be properly renamed as EA-VMTD/DIT, which hematologic phenotype is TTP-like syndrome. On the other hand, consumption coagulopathy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that occurs due to pathologic activation of aberrant TF path caused by TF released from leukemic promyelocytes should be called true DIC [20]. True DIC in APL is made of disseminated fibrin clots that occur without vascular injury. Its hematologic phenotype is always characterized by hemorrhagic syndrome [2\u20134, 20].",

In modern medical literature, for example, many authors claimed one organ phenotypic syndrome causes several other organ dysfunctions such as acute renal failure, encephalopathy, and hepatic failure [47\u201349]. In sepsis, the concept of endothelial heterogeneity and organotropism for organ localization and the phenotype of VMTD as expression of underlying pathology support that biorgan or multiorgan manifestations are just different phenotypes of the same disease EA-VMTD [29]. Likewise, additional organ phenotypes that are often designated as extra-organ manifestations (e.g., extra-renal phenotypes in HUS, extra-pancreatic phenotypes in pancreatitis and extra-pulmonary phenotypes in acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) are expression of the same hemostatic disease EA-VMTD.

Once endotheliopathy occurs in sepsis, endothelial dysfunction promotes the activation of two independent endothelial pathways; one is inflammatory and the other is microthrombotic. In short, two main molecular events are: 1) release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and others [1\u20133, 7, 35, 36], and 2) activation of the platelet [51, 52] and exocytosis of ULVWF [53, 54]. The former triggers inflammation through \u201cactivated inflammatory pathway\u201d, and the latter mediates microthrombogenesis via \u201cactivated microthrombotic pathway\u201d. Inflammation promotes inflammatory symptoms, but microthrombogenesis mediates thrombosis to produce microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes [54\u201356]. Micothrombogenesis is activated when the protease ADAMTS13 is insufficient to cleave the excess of exocytosed ULVWF with or without mild to moderate underlying enzyme deficiency that occurs due to polymorphism or heterozygous mutation of ADAMTS13 [57\u201360]. These microthrombi strings produce DIT in the smaller and larger vasculatures of various organs [1\u20134].",

However, in endotheliopathy associated with sepsis, only ULVWF path of normal hemostasis becomes activated because TF is not available in the endothelium [32]. Endotheliopathy in sepsis triggers exocytosis of ULVWF and activates platelets, and produces microthrombi strings. The microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes must be the intrinsic character of the blood clots in \u201cDIC\u201d of sepsis that occurs as the result of lone activation of ULVWF path illustrated in Fig. 2. Therefore, the concept of \u201cDIC\u201d in sepsis-associated coagulopathy is due to activated TF path producing \u201cfibrin clots\u201d is an incorrect interpretation. This interpretative mistake has been very costly. Thus, according to \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d, \u201cDIC\u201d is the same to EA-VMTD/DIT and acute \u201cDIC\u201d is EA-VMTD/DIT with hepatic coagulopathy/hemorrhagic syndrome.

Because sepsis-induced vascular injury is typically limited to the endothelium, only ULVWF path becomes activated and causes vascular microthrombosis in the smaller and larger vasculatures [3]. Sepsis-associated coagulopathy has shown to express the changes in antithrombotic and prothrombotic markers, which include TF path-related markers such as thrombin, antithrombin, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, activated protein C (APC), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and thrombomodulin (TM). These expressed TF path markers have indirectly supported the role of activated TF path in the pathogenesis of \u201cDIC\u201d. However, these TF path-related markers can be explained by alternative mechanisms, including acute DIC with hepatic coagulopathy, combined micro-macrothrombotic syndrome, concomitant vascular injury as a result of surgery and vascular access, and perhaps more commonly MODS resulting in tissue necrosis, especially of the liver, kidneys and lungs, in advancing severe sepsis. In retrospect, expressed TF path markers in sepsis can be ascribed to secondary events that are unrelated to primary pathogenesis of activated ULVWF path as illustrated in Fig. 2.",

The true markers of \u201cDIC\u201d are activated platelet, increased FVIII activity, and increased VWF from, excessive release of ULVWF, and upregulated collagen binding that result from activated ULVWF path [4, 20]. It is no wonder why clinical trials using antithrombin agents, APC, recombinant TFPI and recombinant TM was unsuccssful in sepsis-associated coagulopathy. It was likely due to the fact that sepsis-associated \u201cDIC\u201d is not true DIC, but is EA-VMTD (i.e., TTP-like syndrome) caused by activated ULVWF path. Further, endothelial injury alone cannot induce fibrinogenesis, but only provokes partial hemostasis, leading to microthrombogenesis, and produces EA-VMTD. On the other hand, APL-associated DIC that occurs due to activation of aberrant TF path is true DIC [20].",

The essential logic in the formation of thrombosis is normal hemostasis must be accompanied by intravascular injury [4, 20]. Without it, no thrombosis can be formed because activation of ULVWF path and/or TF path is sine qua non in thrombogenesis. Further, only three exceptions among thrombotic disorders occur without vascular injury. They are (1) TTP, which is aberrant thrombosis because vessel is not injured, but still utilizes \u201cULVWF\u201d path in ADAMTS13 deficiency, (2) APL, which is aberrant thrombosis because vessel is not injured, but still utilizes \u201cTF\u201d path due to overexpressed TF from leukemic promyelocytes, and (3) heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome, which is pathologic thrombosis because vessel is not injured, and also utilizes neither ULVWF path nor TF path [4, 20]. However, we know cellular and molecular traps, and perhaps adhesion molecules participate in the hemostatic plug and thrombus formation, which is illustrated in Fig. 2, where blood cells/molecules are trapped in comingling process during blood clots formation (macrothrombosis) in the unifying stage of microthrombi strings and fibrin clots. This author believes that NETosis is not active hemostatic processes, but is a passive one associated with secondary event trapping blood cells and molecules such as DNAs and histones in the process of thrombogenesis.",

However, activated TF path alone does not consume platelets in the formation of fibrin meshes/fibrin clots via the extrinsic coagulation cascade. The above abnormal coagulation profile is also consistent with hepatic coagulopathy. The main differentiating laboratory features are increased FVIII and markedly decreased FVII in EA-VMTD/DIT (i.e., \u201cDIC\u201d)\u2013associated hepatic coagulopathy but markedly decreased FVIII and normal FVII in true DIC (e.g., APL).

Milder shear stress is the likely reason why schistocytes are rare and hemolytic anemia is more covert in sepsis. Thus, MAHA is less commonly unmasked, but hemolytic anemia can be an important clue establishing the sepsis-associated VMTD if an experienced hematologist carefully evaluates the thrombocytopenic patient in sepsis with a high index of suspicion. This will save many lives if the diagnosis of TTP-like syndrome can be uncovered in the earliest stage of sepsis. In regard to shear stress, exception may be hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with EA-VMTD, in which schistocytes are encountered in a large number and produces severe MAHA.

MODS occur as a result of microthrombosis that causes reversible hypoxia in organs unless it advances to terminal multiorgan failure. Organ dysfunction syndrome in sepsis, including fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)/acute liver failure [92], acute necrotizing pancreatitis [93], myocardial infarction [95], acute adrenal insufficiency [50, 96, 97], and rhabdomyolysis [98] may be reversible with improvement of sepsis unless necrotic and gangrenous change develops as seen in tissue gangrene [90] and peripheral digit ischemic syndrome [91]. More serious combined phenotypic syndromes, which underlying pathogenesis is still being debated, include hepatic encephalopathy [92], hepato-renal syndrome [99, 100], hepatic coagulopathy [1\u20133, 101], and cardio-pulmonary syndrome [102].

For example, case reports in medical literature have often cited that pancreatitis was responsible for TTP-like syndrome [93] and caused acute renal failure [47], encephalopathy [48] and FHF [49].

Therefore, septic shock had been ascribed to underlying circulatory and cellular metabolic abnormalities profound enough to substantially increase mortality [103]. Although multiple organ dysfunctions take place due to hypoxia induced by DIT, the pathophysiological mechanism of septic shock is still an unsolved riddle.

However, enough evidences have been accumulated that septic shock represents adrenal crisis/acute adrenal insufficiency (AAI) associated with adrenal hemorrhage and/or necrosis due to DIT. AAI is a more serious form of MODS [104\u2013106]. For example, the tropism of pathogen Neisseria meningitides to the adrenal glands causes Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [50, 96, 97, 106]. Indeed, \u201cDIC\u201d, which presently is being renamed as TTP-like syndrome or EA-VMTD/DIT [1\u20134, 20], has been associated with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [96, 97, 106, 107]. The role of AAI in septic shock has been established [107\u2013110]. Its proposed pathogenesis is illustrated in detail in Fig. 5. This proposition of adrenal crisis/AAI resulting from microthrombosis would have a significant ramification in the management of septic shock [111].",

Additionally, many of these disorders can occur as a serious life-threatening complication of sepsis or other critical illnesses and are hemostatic diseases presenting as microthrombosis or microthrombo-coagulopathy [20] without clear distinction. This complexity has contributed to the confusion on the exact nature of coagulopathy and thrombopathy in sepsis. In the medical literature, poorly defined sepsis-associated coagulopathy has often been called to be DIC. Sometimes, even proficient coagulation specialists have expressed uneasiness using the term DIC because the diagnosis and pathogenesis could not be unequivocally established because fatality be high and no known effective treatment available. This ambiguity in the concept of DIC must have contributed to the poor outcome of the treatment in sepsis, including unsatisfactory clinical trials and inappropriate anticoagulation, antithrombotic therapy and plasma therapy.",

In true DIC associated with APL, the intrinsic character of blood clots is fibrin clots made of fibrin meshes via activated TF path, but in \u201cDIC\u201d of sepsis-associated coagulopathy, the intrinsic character of blood clots is microthrombi composed of platelet-ULVWF strings via activated ULVWF path.

These may be seen in advanced stage of MODS and hepatic coagulopathy.

However, a better explanation rests on combined hemostasis of microthrombogenesis and macrothrombogenesis although the latter is secondary event occurring as a complication of EA-VMTD/DIT. The pathophysiological mechanism of combined micro-macrothrombotic syndrome can be easily supported by \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d. Typically, first set-up is the hospital admission of a patient with sepsis that provokes EA-VMTD/DIT. The patient would need multiple venous and arterial accesses and/or perhaps surgery during hospitalization [91]. This vascular intervention causes intravascular injury, leading to damage of SET/EVT and release of TF. Activated TF path leads to fibrinogenesis and forms fibrin clots in circulation. Since on-going ULVWF path is already active from endotheliopathy and microthrombi strings are being formed, fibrin clots and some of microthrombi would be unified and produce intravascular macrothrombi via macrothrombogenesis [20]. Macrothrombi could travel to the peripheral arterial vasculatures in small and large arteries of the digits and extremities. This combined micro-macrothrombotic syndrome could lead to multiple well-demarcated peripheral symmetrical gangrene at distal vascular trees.",

Perhaps untimely treatment with TPE due to the delay in establishing the diagnosis has been the main factor for poor outcome of EA-VMTD [78, 81, 89, 91]. The rationale utilizing TPE in TTP-like syndrome is to cleave and/or remove the excess of ULVWF in the patient plasma with replacement of normal donor plasma that contains adequate amounts of ADAMTS13 [19]. Indeed, TPE has been extensively utilized by clinicians when a patient was thought to have atypical TTP, TTP-like syndrome or \u201cthrombotic microangiopathy\u201d. In retrospective review of many reports and case studies, most of them were found to have the clinical features of EA-VMTD/DIT.

Recombinant ADAMTS13 is being used only in Phase I study for GA-VMTD (i.e., hereditary TTP) at this time. Since its proteolytic activity on ULVWF is well established, this investigational agent should be available for clinical trials in EA-VMTD, including septic syndromes and \u201cDIC\u201d as well as MODS caused by EA-VMTD. In a latest study on acquired TTP, anti-microthrombotic agent caplacizumab, which is anti-von Willebrand factor (VWF) nanobody [143], has shown significant clinical benefit.

In sepsis, complement activation that is destructive to ECs of the host can provoke endotheliopathy, which promotes two independent molecular events, leading to activation of inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway. The result is endotheliopathy associated inflammation and EA-VMTD presenting with TTP-like syndrome. In a big picture, physiologic protective immune system guards the host and eliminates invading pathogen, but pathologic destructive endothelial system is detrimental to the host when protective immune systems are compromised and antibiotics are not optimally effective.

Blood Coagul Fibrinoplysis. 2018; 29:573\u201384). Two different thrombotic paths, microthrombotic (ULVWF) and fibrinogenic (TF), are initiated in normal hemostasis, but later the two paths must unify to conclude normal hemostasis with passive role of NETs; it stops the bleeding in external bodily injury and produce the thrombosis in intravascular injury. However, in the different level (depth) of intravascular injury, thrombogenesis takes two different paths. If the level of intravascular injury is confined to the endothelium, lone ULVWF path become activated and causes microthrombosis (i.e., VMTD) because TF path is not activated. On the other hand, if the level of intravascular injury extends from the endothelium to SET/EVT, TF path becomes also activated and causes macrothrombosis (e.g., DVT). In one theoretical situation, if only SET/EVT is injured, available TF is supposed to activate TF path, but in reality this injury does not cause thrombosis without breached endothelium. However, in pathologic hemostasis, aberrant TF activation occurs and produces fibrin clots (i.e., true DIC) in APL due to TF expression in intravascular space from leukemic promyelocytes. APL is a consumption coagulopathy due to lone activation of TF path. This logic is based on \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d. Please see Figure 2, showing 3 different thrombosis disorders via microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, macrothrombogenesis, which are annotated in bold face. Each thrombognesis occurs when ULVWF path, TF path or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels of damage in intravascular injury (endothelium and SET/EVT). The characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots and macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinctly different clinical thrombotic disorders [20].
