With the ease and speed of global travel in the 21st century, the world is now a global village in terms of epidemic transmission [2]. The Influenza A (H1N1) virus can transmit from humans to humans by direct body contact or respiratory droplets. The infectious disease can spread widely as people carrying pathogens travel and commute between cities by multiple means of transport. Thus, intercity travel is important for the diffusion of viruses [3,4,5].",

In the United States, the amount of people who travel daily along the interstate highways during the influenza season is larger than 3.8 million, which is over twice those who travel by air [6]. In mainland China, road traffic conveyed around 28 billion passengers in 2009, accounting for 93% of total passengers, much more than trains and airlines [7]. The mode choice was determined not only by Chinese people\u2019s choice preference for travel but also by the features of various travel modes. Airlines are the fastest mode, but they were relatively expensive in China in 2009, so they mainly served domestic business and government officials, although they have become much cheaper nowadays. Railways were mainly used for occasional long-distance travelling [8] (e.g., the Spring Festival travel rush in China [9]), whereas highways and freeways were more often used for daily and weekly short-distance commuting [10]. Though more and more people today choose the high-speed railway for their daily trips in China, this was unavailable in 2009. National highways in China are funded and constructed by the central government and are vital connections between provinces and cities, without the collection of tolls, whereas tolls on expressways are quite high, meaning car and buses tend to avoid them [11]. Thus, passenger transportation on national highways well reflected the nationwide general highway transportation system in China in 2009.",

            "text": "Road traffic is considered to play an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. City traffic can be modelled as a road network to help simulate the transmission of airborne diseases in a city [12]. National highways and interprovincial freeways were the foremost path for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) being carried by people from Beijing to neighboring areas in 2003 [13]. The transmission pattern of dengue in Cambodia has been found to be related to the network of national roads, where traffic allowed human carriers to move [14]. The high-density road network is an important explanatory factor to the dengue epidemic in 2014 in Guangzhou city and Foshan city in China [5]. For the highly pathogenic avian influenza, national highways were one of the most important predictive environmental variables for the infection risk in 2004 in China [11,15], and the number of poultry outbreaks had a positive association with the road density in Indonesia during 2003\u20132008 [16]. In the United States, the genetic distances between seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses were found to correlate with the distances along those parts of the interstate highways most used by commuters, along which only 1% of commutes occurred over distances of more than 242 kilometers, and the role of this road-based travel in facilitating influenza transmission should not be neglected [6]. Research on the spread of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in the Republic of Korea showed that the cumulative number of new cases increased in the direction along a highway line [17]. Highways, expressways, and county roads showed their importance to the transmission of the same virus between city and town [1]. It has also been shown that counties in China intersected by national highways and freeways, but not railways, were significantly associated with the spread of this virus [10]. Moreover, the confined space in buses and cars are more limited than that in trains, and the vehicles are usually more crowded and filled with stagnant air, which may facilitate infection to fellow travelers [13] in spite of air filters as an effort to reduce potential virus aerosol concentrations.",

A previous study found that income, railway capacity, per person gross domestic product, and urban rate played roles in the interregional transmission of SARS at the province level in China [20]. Urbanization has been reported to partially affect the transmission of seasonal influenza in U.S. cities [21]. Other socioeconomic factors like population density, illiteracy, and unemployment were significantly associated with the mortality from the 1918 influenza pandemic in Chicago [19]. As for the 2009 influenza pandemic in China, it has been suggested that the spatial patterns of public places impacted the mixing and commuting of people, which then influenced virus transmission within Changsha city [22]; another study suggested that, apart from domestic travel, population density was related to the spread of viruses at the county level [10].",

We calculated four classic centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality) for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (SumRatio and Multicenter Distance). We first evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features, and then used spatial autoregressive models to investigate the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors on the diffusion of the 2009 influenza pandemic.",

            "text": "Inspired by the method of Dominant Flow Analysis [29], we propose a new node centrality measure called SumRatio, which is a synthetic indicator combining the number of passengers and the spatial distance, measuring the global importance of a node to all others in a network. Higher values of SumRatio relate to more frequent exchanges of people and economic trade, which makes it easier for viruses to spread among individuals. SumRatio can be calculated as follows.\n(1)G(i,j)=mNi\u03b2Nj\u03b4dij\u03b3,\n(2)Gp(i,j)=G(i,j)\u2211j=1~n, j\u2260iG(i,j),\n(3)SumRatio(j)=\u2211i=1~n, i\u2260jGp(i,j),\nwhere G(i,j) represents the gravity coefficient between cities i and j; N is the outflow highway passenger capacity; d is the shortest distance between two cities along national highways; and m, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03b3 are constants. Gp(i,j) represents the ratio of gravity coefficient between cities i and j to the sum of gravity coefficients between city i and any other cities in the network and measures the relative importance of city j to city i. SumRatio(j) is the sum of the gravity coefficient ratio, which measures the integrated importance of city j to all other cities in the network. The two matrices (matrix G and Gp) are generated using a gravity model [30,31] based on the demographic data. Matrix G is a symmetric matrix while Gp is unsymmetrical [32]. n is the total number of cities in the national highway network (n=333). m, \u03b2, and \u03b4 are set to be 1, 1, and 1, respectively, as estimated by Reference [32]. \u03b3 is set to be 1 according to the result of Reference [31]. N can be estimated as follows: Because the \u201chighway passenger capacity\u201d figures found in the statistical yearbook consisted of three parts, including the highway passenger capacity within a city, the inflow passenger capacity, and outflow passenger capacity of a city, we assumed that the inflow and outflow passenger capacities of a city are equal to each other and that they both could compose \u201cthe passenger capacity between cities\u201d. Among the 104,096 nonzero values of the distance stored in matrix D2, more than 98% were larger than 200 km. Hence, we assumed that the highway passenger capacity within a city can be represented by the number of passengers transported within the range of a circle whose center is a certain city with a radius of 100 km. It has also been reported that the highway passenger volume occurred within a distance shorter than 100 km accounted for more than 90% of the total highway passenger volume. Therefore, we assumed that the highway passenger capacity within a city accounted for 90% of the total highway passenger volume and that the outflow highway passenger capacity accounted for 5%.",

            "text": "In this study, we evaluated the impacts of road traffic and other socioeconomic factors on the nationwide spread of influenza A (H1N1) across China in 2009. We constructed a national highway network and proposed two new centrality measures: SumRatio and Multicenter Distance. Both new measures were significantly correlated with all three epidemiological features in question (cumulative incidence, onset week, and epidemic duration). Based on the positive association between onset week and Multicenter Distance, we understand the transmission process of influenza A (H1N1) as follows: At the very beginning, internationally infected individuals quickly arrived in the eight center cities and other cities in eastern China with frequent international communications [34], most of which are spatially distant from each other, after long distance travel by plane [6]. By this means the virus was quickly introduced into new regions. This pattern was important for virus spread in the early stage of an epidemic, especially before strict control measures were taken [13]. The virus then diffused over short-range connections as infectious individuals moved to neighboring areas by ground-based transport along highways [6]. The epidemic followed the classic distance decay theory, starting earlier in the cities which are closer to their nearest center cities, and this was partly supported by the findings in Reference [22].",

            "text": "To verify our discoveries and explanations quantitatively and to acquire quantitative relationships between road traffic, as well as socioeconomic factors and the spread of influenza A (H1N1), we conducted spatial regression analyses. When the cumulative incidence was taken as a response variable in the spatial autoregressive model, the results could be interpreted as follows: People had more chances to contact each other and transmit infectious diseases with a higher base probability in cities of a higher population density [21,22,35], which resulted in a higher cumulative incidence at the end of epidemics. The income level in these cities was also higher [21], and more workers would be attracted to come. It has been previously reported that the density of medical facilities was not significantly associated with the arrival time of the first confirmed influenza A (H1N1) case in each Chinese county in 2009 [10]. Our findings elaborate on this, showing that the density of hospitals has a significant effect on the cumulative incidence at the city level. As we know, cities with more (high-level) hospitals would attract more patients seeking medical treatment [20]. Moreover, many symptomatic patients gathered in hospitals where the space was confined, and cross infection and nosocomial infection by means of virus droplet and aerosol could be facilitated [36], which would also result in a higher incidence. Previous research [37] reported that people between 5\u201324 years old were most affected by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in China. Therefore, our positive association between the proportion of college students and cumulative incidence is consistent with previous works. Cities with a higher SumRatio were more likely to be traffic hubs in the national highway network, and the cumulative incidence would be higher. The larger the Multicenter Distance of a city, the lower the medical treatment level would be, and the cumulative incidence could not be reduced quickly and would remain relatively high. As for cities with a high GDP, they would tend to conduct stronger intervention measures to control the infectious disease, reducing the cumulative incidence. When the onset week was taken as a response variable in the spatial regression, we found that the population density and the number of pigs had negative effects on the epidemic onset in cities. A higher population density meant that the corresponding city was more central and it might have been more likely to have a large airport or train station, and then, the imported cases which could start an epidemic in the city might arrive earlier. The \u201cfirst\u201d reported case may not be the true first person who was infected by the influenza virus in a given city. It is possible that an infected individual arrived in a city and infected others around him/her, but the public health authority did not receive an infection report, and then, the epidemic started silently and developed freely. Thus, the \u201cfirst\u201d case was not announced to the public until the underlying infected population had taken place. As the reservoir of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, pigs can carry this virus, can transmit it to human beings, and may be a magnifier of the population of virus and potentially infected people. Hence, the \u201cfirst\u201d case would be reported earlier in a city where more pigs were fed. When the duration from onset to the first epidemic peak was taken as the response variable in the spatial regression, the results can be interpreted as follows and be supported by the finding in Reference [21] that the periods of epidemics in smaller cities are shorter than those in larger cities. A city with a high population density would have a high proportion of susceptible people who are fuel for epidemics [38,39], which would prolong the duration of an epidemic. It was reported that school students were more susceptible to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) than other age groups in China [37] and that schools were high-risk areas for influenza outbreaks and should be the focus for prevention [22,40]. Therefore, the result that the number of colleges was positively associated with the epidemic duration is consistent with the real situation. Moreover, cities with a larger value of Multicenter Distance would have a smaller population, and the number of susceptible people would also be less. As a result, the epidemic duration would be shorter. Intervention measures of public health authorities in China could shorten the epidemic duration, but these measures were taken upon human beings instead of pigs, which played a role of viral reservoir. The virus might spill over from pigs to the human population continuously, which would prolong the epidemic period. It may be an explanation for the significantly positive association between the number of slaughtered pigs and epidemic duration. In addition, it has been reported recently that the presence of airports and railway stations in prefecture-level cities did not have significant impacts on epidemic duration [41]. Our results complement previous findings and reveal that both road transport and socioeconomic factors had a significant influence on epidemic duration.",

            "text": "Among all means of transport, herein we emphasize the role of road transportation in the spatial diffusion of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in mainland China. It has been reported recently that both aviation and road travel have a significant association with the epidemic arrival day in each prefecture-level city during the whole viral diffusion period, but the role of rail travel was only significant after August 1st 2009 [41]. Although air travel is a significant factor in the global spread of the influenza virus, short-range daily travel on the ground is more important at the regional scale [6], which our results support. To the best of our knowledge, most Chinese people do not travel by air very often (at least in 2009, except for businessmen). Airplanes bring virus carriers to areas that are far from each other and disease-free before landing, which may lead to a spatially random dispersal of viral pathogens. In daily commuting, an infectious individual is likely to infect anyone with whom he/she is in contact, with the probability of infection associated with spatial distance and time length of contact, which may result in a spatially structured viral population [6]. In our spatial regression analyses, the spatial dependence coefficient \u03c1 of three epidemiological features are all significant and positive, which means that the epidemic in a city was positively correlated with those in neighboring cities and indicates that road travel would be more important than air travel for the spatial transmission of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in China. Unlike some countries in Europe and America which experienced two infection peaks of influenza during 2009, China had only one autumn-winter wave in 2009, which could be attributed to the strict prevention and control strategies conducted by China at the early stage of the pandemic [34]. For example, fever screenings performed in airports and railway stations could be expected to detect most symptomatic passengers with a fever, but the expected efficiency of fever screenings in long-distance highway passenger stations should be much lower because a bus is allowed to pick up passengers along the way and they need not gather in a specifically designated station before boarding and because a considerable number of highway passengers would choose private vehicles. Therefore, it is much more difficult to restrict the diffusion of influenza virus by road travel. In this respect, the role of highway passenger transport in dispersing viruses spatially is more important than air and railway modes.",

It has been reported that people in a wealthy region travel farther than people in a relatively poor region in China due to the difference in basic facilities or people\u2019s living standard, and a pandemic emerging in less developed regions might diffuse more slowly [42]. Interestingly, health disparities of people in less developed and developed areas in China might be reduced by the interaction of epidemiological and socioeconomic factors in the face of a newly emerging influenza pandemic, especially in the early stages. For instance, although medical treatment in developed areas is better than that in less developed areas, the epidemic arrival time would be earlier in developed areas with a longer epidemic duration. With the reduction of airfares, the opening of more domestic airlines, and the promotion and popularization of high-speed trains in China, the time cost of the journey is greatly decreased in recent years, and passengers tend to think more about the attractiveness of certain places which are mostly determined by the places\u2019 socioeconomic and environmental conditions and think less about the length of trip distance when they choose destinations for travel. Therefore, the impact of spatial distance on the diffusion of infectious diseases may become smaller in the future, while that of socioeconomic factors will be more and more important.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that the number of newly reported cases peaked at a time point later than the peak of the number of newly affected cities (Figure 2). Our explanations of this finding is that before week 34 (until 23 August) in 2009, the number of cases was quite small and increased very slowly (255 cases per week); the number of affected cities increased steadily (10 cities per week), which was most likely to be driven by the sporadic importation of overseas cases into China, because the majority of new cases before week 30 (until 26 July) were imported cases [34]. From week 35 to week 44 (until 1 November), the increase in the number of new cases sped up significantly (6126 cases per week) and reached its first peak on 27 September, and the large amount of existing cases greatly facilitated the invasion of the virus into unaffected cities; hence, the number of affected cities increased more quickly (18 cities per week) than in the prior period. This could be explained by two possible reasons. The first may be that almost all the new cases were local cases after week 36 (until 6 September), which meant the community transmission of the virus within a city had started, so the number of weekly newly affected cities arrived in its peak on 6 September and the rate of increase dropped afterwards. The second reason could be that the Chinese government took strict prevention and control measures before September 2009, but the measures were relaxed from September [34], which could also partly explain the sharp rise in the number of new cases and newly affected cities at the end of August and the beginning of September. The curve of new cases did not rise continuously but dropped to a local minimum in early October, which may be explained by the reduced case reporting during Chinese National Holidays [37] and could further enlarge the time delay between its peak and the peak of the number of newly affected cases. From week 45 to week 53 (until 31 December), no city was newly affected because almost all prefecture-level cities (except for Yushu City in Qinghai Province) in mainland China had already reported cases in the prior period, and the increasing velocity of the number of new cases was nearly twice of that in the earlier period.",

Although the trend of case reporting was consistent with that of the percentage of respiratory specimens tested positive for the influenza virus, the number of reported cases was much less than the real size of infected individuals [34]. It was observed globally in many influenza outbreaksthat not all cases were reported to the medical services. Therefore, data from virological and serological surveillance should be taken into consideration for further information. Additionally, even though there were several socioeconomic factors which were not significantly associated with all three epidemiological features, there still existed other effective factors that were not included in this research, such as climate conditions. As an ecological study, the results of this study cannot provide evidence for causal relationships but merely suggest probable associations. In future research, a meta-population epidemiological model driven by road travel should be constructed to investigate the diffusion process of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) under the effects of socioeconomic factors.",

Second, we conclude that road transport network and socioeconomic factors had significant impacts on the diffusion of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus at the city level in mainland China and that both should be candidates for the prevention and control of future influenza pandemics.",
