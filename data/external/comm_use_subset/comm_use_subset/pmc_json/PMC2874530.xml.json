A deeper understanding of this phenomenon would allow us to better anticipate and control potentially inappropriate and/or unexpected behaviours in the event of a massive epidemic like influenza. People's feeling of risk is a subjective judgment. Each individual has unique characteristics resulting in unique behaviour towards any specific risk. This behaviour springs from a combination of factors such as personal values, social and cultural background, gender and education [1,2]. The population's knowledge level about the disease plays also an important role in response to an epidemic crisis and could impact on collective attitudes [3,4]. The media also play a role in influencing public perceptions of epidemics or pandemics as they tend to bias perceptions by under- or over-estimating risk factors, morbidity and mortality [5].",

Subjects who had previously indicated self-reported knowledge of avian influenza were invited to answer questions about the disease's transmission routes, their behaviours at the time the disease had occurred in France, and their opinion on preventive measures taken by the French health authorities, also based on a scale from 1 (very confident) to 4 (not at all confident). This section was followed by questions on reactions to the likelihood of a new epidemic, sources of information, trust in these sources and level of confidence in public health authorities. In order to determine the importance of epidemics among other preoccupations, the questionnaire concluded by asking the respondents to classify their three main threats for the French society among the followed items: cancers, pollution, unemployment, terrorism, obesity and epidemics.",

Most respondents (n = 430, 76%) did not consider poultry or egg consumption a route of transmission, but their opinions about possible transmission by close contact with contaminated individuals were more equivocal.

Overall, behavioural changes were more significant among women.

About one quarter of the study population was concerned by epidemics, probably because of the public's overall confidence in the healthcare system and in its ability to handle such situations. Indeed, as soon as suspicion of avian influenza in a poultry breeding, surveillance measures including confiscation of the breeding, and controls of all movements (people, other animals, etc) in the suspected area were set up to limit the propagation of the infection. Relative powerlessness in the face of such a large event could also be a contributing factor. Similar arguments have been reported in a qualitative survey conducted in the U.K. and the Netherlands [9]. Moreover, the majority of human epidemics reported by media have occurred in foreign countries (avian influenza and SARS in Asia, cholera, and hemorrhagic fever in Africa). Severe cases of infections such as the outbreak of legionnaire's disease reported by the media in France are rather sporadic. Pursuant to the present study, an outbreak of Clostridium difficile type 027 occurred in Northern France [10].

The epizootic lasted two months and may explain why subjects living in this area were well informed about the disease. France was the first European Union country where non-wild birds had been implicated. After the epizootic, extensive media attention led to a decrease in visits to this area, particularly to a public bird park located in the district. These results emphasize the importance of implementing effective communication strategies for the general public. In the early phase of an outbreak, communication is usually targeted at a segment of the population considered at risk. In the rest of the population, this could create a feeling of complacency and lead to stigmatization and discrimination against the population labelled to be potentially at risk. Such attitudes have been reported during SARS epidemics [9,11-14]. Another striking example is provided by AIDS. The earliest education and prevention campaigns were mainly directed at men who have sex with men and at young people. This approach may have contributed to an increase in the incidence of AIDS among heterosexuals and higher age categories [15-19].",

The knowledge level about nosocomial infections and AIDS was substantially different between age categories. Younger people felt they were more at risk of acquiring a sexually-transmitted disease than they were of an infection during hospitalization and were, therefore, more likely to be informed about the former.

The population said it would follow advice given by public authorities and would agree to be quarantined, to wash their hands several times a day and wear a face mask. However, we should exercise caution in extrapolating the observed feeling of relative complacency towards epidemics in real situations. During serious outbreaks of disease, the population would probably move from a phase of calm and serenity to a phase of major panic without going through an intermediate stage. The SARS epidemic was an excellent example of this situation [22]. Compliance with advice could also reflect anxiety and psychological distress [23]. A positive dose-response gradient between self-protection and level of anxiety has been reported by a longitudinal telephone survey in Hong Kong [24]. It is noteworthy that panic caused by local outbreaks may lead to worldwide reactions because the spread of pathogenic agents in modern societies is facilitated by extensive air travel.",

Since the first case was identified in Mexico in early April 2009, various national and international health and governmental bodies have made plans to monitor and control this new outbreak.
