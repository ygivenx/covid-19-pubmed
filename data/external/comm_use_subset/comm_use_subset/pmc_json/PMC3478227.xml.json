Recent estimates indicate 2.7 million cases occur each year in the U.S. and 600,000 deaths occur annually worldwide (reviewed in [1]). Available data on two attenuated vaccines show they both are efficacious in reducing the incidence and severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the U.S. and other developed countries [2-5]. Reported vaccine efficacy is lower in developing nations where the majority of deaths from rotavirus infections occur, likely due to multiple factors including suboptimal immune responses associated with poor nutritional status or concurrent enteric infections [4,6,7]. Methods to enhance natural disease resistance find value in these regions if protective immunity could be improved by complementing existing vaccines with products that have antiviral or immune adjuvant activity.",

Pharmacologically active components that have been most studied include triterpene saponins, with glycyrrhizin (GA) being present in the highest concentration [9,10]. 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) is the aglycone product of GA hydrolysis mediated in the gut by bacterial glucoronidases [11,12]. Both GA and GRA have been studied in several systems to evaluate their immunomodulatory properties. GA has been used in Japan for >20 years to treat chronic viral hepatitis, and patients administered a continuous regimen of an intravenous formulation of GA (Stronger Neo--Minophagen C\u00ae, SNMC) demonstrate clinical improvement and reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma [13-16]. GA also has been studied in an animal model of viral infection. Mice administered GA intraperitoneally survived a lethal dose of influenza virus [17]. Antibody to IFN\u03b3 abolished this protective effect, but the mechanisms of protection in this model system remain unclear. While mechanisms of action in vivo are not well understood, they likely are multi-factorial and could be due to direct effects on virus replication, or functions associated with modulation of inflammatory and cell protective responses.",

Subsequently, GA was shown to have antiviral activity against viruses in several families including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, influenza virus, SARS coronavirus, hepatitis C virus and others (reviewed in [19]). Suggested mechanisms of activity in these systems include direct effects on the adsorption, penetration and particle maturation steps of the replication cycle and in some cases, direct inactivation of virus particles. For example, anti-influenza virus activity of GA in cell culture was attributed to interference with viral endocytosis, likely due to its ability to modulate membrane fluidity [20,21], although alternative mechanisms recently have been proposed [22].",

The utility of GRA as an antiviral compound is not as well described as GA, but there are data to suggest GRA has immunomodulatory and cell protective activity in vitro and in vivo. For example, in vitro, GRA induces NF\u0138B-mediated nitric oxide synthase expression in macrophages [24], and IL-8 expression in epithelial cells [25]. Others studies also suggest potential anti-inflammatory activity associated with reduced cytokine expression and attenuation of NF\u0138B activation [26,27]. In vivo, protective efficacy of GRA against protozoan and bacterial infections has been demonstrated. In a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis [24,28], analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts in isolated spleen cells from infected animals revealed that GRA induces IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12, indicative of a TH1 and curative response. In a bacterial system, GRA attenuated lung pathology associated with Staphyloccus aureus pneumonia [29].",

The prior experiments measured replication at a low multiplicity of infection (0.01 pfu/cell) over a long course of infection, and measured cell-associated virus. The current experiments were designed to measure one round of replication at a higher multiplicity of infection (three pfu/cell) so that we could begin to decipher mechanisms of inhibition that did not include cell-to-cell spread. To test inhibitory effects of GA and GRA on rotavirus infectivity, each compound was added to cells either six hours prior to RRV infection, or following the adsorption step. Cultures then were harvested six hours post-infection, and infectious virus was titered by IFA. In contrast to previous studies using a low multiplicity of infection, pre-treatment only did not significantly reduce virus titers under the conditions of these experiments (Figure 2). In contrast, GRA treatment resulted in a 99% reduction in infectivity when the compound was continuously present (pre/post) or when added post--infection only (post). This level of reduction in virus yields cannot be explained by simple cytotoxic effects on the cells at the degree defined by the toxicity assays. GA had no effect on virus yield whether the compound was added pre- or post-infection, as titers did not differ significantly from mock treated, infected controls. Therefore, GA was not investigated further.",

As before, RRV was adsorbed to the monolayer for one hour at 4\u00b0C, adsorption medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium, and cultures were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C to allow virus entry. GRA then was added to the cultures and infections were allowed to proceed for five hours. Lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot. Figure 4A shows there was a substantial reduction in the amount of VP2 and VP6 in GRA treated cells. Evidence that virus replication was occurring and measurable at this time point was provided by detection of NSP2, the levels of which also were significantly reduced in treated cells compared to untreated cells. To further assess the reduction in the amount of VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in treated cells, the same experiment was performed, except that GRA was added two hours following the 37\u00b0C incubation. The results indicated that the degree of reduction in VP2 was similar to the previous experiment (Figure 4B). The amounts of VP6 and NSP2 still were diminished. However, they were higher than those observed when GRA was added one hour following the 37\u00b0C incubation. While one interpretation of these results suggests addition of GRA at later times post-adsorption may diminish its effects on levels of viral protein and consequently virus titers, the observation that the level of VP2 remained low suggests other mechanisms are at play. Together, the data show GRA has a profound effect on the accumulation of rotavirus proteins in infected cells, consistent with the observed reduction in yields of infectious virus.",

The mechanisms by which these compounds are antiviral, and the steps of the virus replication cycle at which they act vary depending on the virus under investigation. There are ample data to suggest antiviral activity of GA in vivo may result from induction of cytoprotective and immunomodulatory responses rather than effects on virus-specific functions per se, and such mechanisms of action could in part explain its broad-spectrum activity (reviewed in [32]. In contrast to GA, fewer reports of in vivo activity of GRA are available. However, when administered intravenously, GA is metabolized in the liver by lysosomal \u03b2-D-glucoronidase into 3-mono--glucoronide-glycyrrhetinic acid, and then finally by glucoronidases of intestinal bacteria into GRA, which then can be reabsorbed [11,12,34]. Therefore, it is possible that some of the in vivo effects of GA are due to one or more of its metabolites, including GRA.",

The reduction in yields of infectious virus and viral protein levels when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours post-adsorption suggests interference with rotavirus replication occurs at a step subsequent to virus entry. These data are consistent with previous studies illustrating a similar effect of GA on in vitro replication of NDV, VSV, HSV-1, and VV when the compound was added several hours post-infection [18]. Interestingly, the amount of VP2 present when GRA was added two-hours post-entry was similar to the levels observed when GRA was added one hour post-entry, but the amounts of VP6 and NSP2 were considerably higher. This observation could be explained by effects on viral transcription, translation or degradation of viral proteins, but how such mechanisms would explain the selective reduction are difficult to predict. Studies to conclusively define steps at which GRA exerts its inhibitory effect are in progress.",

For example, we have shown that GRA induces NF\u0138B activation in MA104 cells [25], and more recently reported that some rotavirus strains down-regulate NF\u0138B activity through the functions of nonstructural protein NSP1 [35]. NF\u0138B activity is required for induction of a robust antiviral response, and sustained activation of NF\u0138B by GRA could override virus-encoded mechanisms that down-regulate its activity, resulting in reduced virus replication. Other studies also report GRA-mediated activation of NF\u0138B [24,28]. Of note, however, are reports showing GRA inhibits NF\u0138B activation, and this has been interpreted as GRA-mediated regulation of the inflammatory response [22,26,36]. In these and other studies, the effects of GRA on NF\u0138B were measured following induction of the pathway by virus infection or by pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the effects of GRA on NF\u0138B are context-dependent. Deciphering the interactions between GRA and the NF\u0138B signaling pathway at the molecular level will contribute to understanding how its activity is modulated depending on the stimulus. One possible alternative mechanism of replication inhibition that is not mutually exclusive is provided by several reports indicating GRA modulates PI3/Akt activity [27,37,38]. Pharmacological inhibition of the PI3/Akt pathway substantially reduces rotavirus yields in culture [39]. The effects of GRA on these signaling pathways in the context of rotavirus infection and how GRA may modulate them currently are under investigation.",
